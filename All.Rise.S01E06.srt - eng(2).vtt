(Talent Hunt Program Day 13)

00:01:49.986 --> 00:01:52.070
(Wang Lu 6, Huang Yue 5,
Yan Fei 4, Li Ke 4)

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:53.768
(Guo Xiaoyu 3,
Jiang Chen 2, Ren Jiatong 1)

00:01:57.538 --> 00:01:58.184
Come in.

00:01:59.937 --> 00:02:00.712
Mr. Song.

00:02:03.338 --> 00:02:04.618
Sorry to disturb you.

00:02:06.058 --> 00:02:07.538
I'm here to plead for Ren Jiatong.

00:02:08.177 --> 00:02:10.577
I know she was wrong
to submit the report late.

00:02:10.777 --> 00:02:12.978
But I've seen how hard she works.

00:02:13.538 --> 00:02:14.858
She can sacrifice everything

00:02:14.858 --> 00:02:15.698
for work.

00:02:16.617 --> 00:02:17.737
So I believe

00:02:17.737 --> 00:02:19.897
there must be some mistake.

00:02:20.777 --> 00:02:22.017
I hope we can follow

00:02:22.777 --> 00:02:24.107
the principle of valuing talents

00:02:24.418 --> 00:02:25.337
and not eliminate her.

00:02:26.497 --> 00:02:27.418
Rules are rules.

00:02:28.258 --> 00:02:28.818
I understand.

00:02:29.418 --> 00:02:30.337
In the previous round,

00:02:30.337 --> 00:02:31.617
I earned myself

00:02:31.737 --> 00:02:32.737
an extra chance.

00:02:33.017 --> 00:02:34.098
Now I want to give it

00:02:34.378 --> 00:02:35.218
to Ren Jiatong.

00:02:35.938 --> 00:02:36.978
I hope you and Ms. Bai

00:02:36.978 --> 00:02:38.258
will review her report.

00:02:43.617 --> 00:02:44.577
May I ask

00:02:45.337 --> 00:02:46.818
why you're pleading for Ren Jiatong?

00:02:47.737 --> 00:02:49.258
She's your biggest competitor.

00:02:50.337 --> 00:02:51.258
If she leaves,

00:02:51.978 --> 00:02:53.138
you should be celebrating.

00:02:55.497 --> 00:02:57.378
Yet you're rushing to defend her.

00:02:58.098 --> 00:02:58.777
Does this mean

00:02:58.777 --> 00:03:00.017
our offer from the program

00:03:01.258 --> 00:03:03.098
isn't that appealing to you?

00:03:03.617 --> 00:03:04.258
I do want it.

00:03:05.457 --> 00:03:06.337
I want it very much.

00:03:06.858 --> 00:03:07.897
And I'm confident

00:03:08.378 --> 00:03:09.218
I'll win eventually.

00:03:10.617 --> 00:03:12.057
Ren Jiatong might lose to me

00:03:12.057 --> 00:03:13.418
in one of the upcoming rounds

00:03:13.897 --> 00:03:14.538
and leave.

00:03:15.057 --> 00:03:17.337
But the reason I'm pleading for her

00:03:17.337 --> 00:03:18.858
is that through this program,

00:03:18.858 --> 00:03:20.297
I've met many good competitors.

00:03:21.378 --> 00:03:22.698
Ren Jiatong is one of them.

00:03:23.258 --> 00:03:24.057
While I want to win,

00:03:24.057 --> 00:03:25.858
I want to defeat her fair and square

00:03:26.698 --> 00:03:27.777
in a competition.

00:03:29.057 --> 00:03:31.577
Moreover, I think Jun An

00:03:31.897 --> 00:03:33.577
values nurturing young talents

00:03:33.938 --> 00:03:35.698
with time and effort.

00:03:36.538 --> 00:03:38.538
It shouldn't dismiss someone
for one mistake.

00:03:41.297 --> 00:03:41.978
I've reviewed it.

00:03:44.177 --> 00:03:45.378
Your argument

00:03:45.378 --> 00:03:46.497
was quite persuasive.

00:03:47.617 --> 00:03:48.337
What you said

00:03:48.978 --> 00:03:49.858
will be considered.

00:03:51.538 --> 00:03:52.138
Thank you.

00:04:01.418 --> 00:04:01.938
What's wrong?

00:04:04.297 --> 00:04:05.017
What happened?

00:04:06.218 --> 00:04:07.098
I just saw you

00:04:07.098 --> 00:04:09.138
chasing Ren Jiatong
to Mr. Song's office.

00:04:10.858 --> 00:04:12.698
Are you repeating
Mr. Song and Ms. Bai's...?

00:04:12.698 --> 00:04:13.457
Of course not.

00:04:13.577 --> 00:04:14.017
Mistake?

00:04:14.017 --> 00:04:15.418
You shut up.

00:04:15.418 --> 00:04:16.458
You're cooking up stories.

00:04:17.817 --> 00:04:18.497
What's that look?

00:04:18.497 --> 00:04:19.297
Let me tell you,

00:04:19.737 --> 00:04:21.297
there's no my type at our law firm.

00:04:22.817 --> 00:04:23.858
No ideal type for you?

00:04:23.858 --> 00:04:25.937
Right. The only one close to my type

00:04:26.257 --> 00:04:27.338
might be Guo Xiaoyu.

00:04:27.338 --> 00:04:27.898
Guo Xiaoyu?

00:04:27.978 --> 00:04:29.697
Wait. No, she's close,

00:04:29.697 --> 00:04:30.418
just acceptable.

00:04:30.418 --> 00:04:31.697
But she already has a boyfriend.

00:04:32.497 --> 00:04:33.098
I mean

00:04:33.098 --> 00:04:35.497
there's absolutely nothing
between me and Ren Jiatong.

00:04:37.257 --> 00:04:38.458
Explain this.

00:04:39.297 --> 00:04:40.898
What do you mean by "acceptable"?

00:04:48.737 --> 00:04:49.658
Wait, I didn't mean...

00:05:12.458 --> 00:05:13.257
It's out!

00:05:20.418 --> 00:05:21.458

you all know the rankings.

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:51.729
Ren Jiatong.

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:52.809
Your report has sparked

00:05:52.809 --> 00:05:53.850
controversy among mentors.

00:05:54.249 --> 00:05:55.689
In terms of content quality,

00:05:55.689 --> 00:05:57.410
you and Wang Lu
are tied for first place.

00:05:58.129 --> 00:06:00.552
But due to late submission,
you receive no points.

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:03.489
Currently, Huang Yue, and Guo Xiaoyu,

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:05.169
and you are tied for last place.

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:13.970
Therefore,

00:06:14.809 --> 00:06:16.609
one of the three

00:06:16.609 --> 00:06:17.609

have differing opinions.

00:06:20.809 --> 00:06:23.249
You performed well
in the portrait rights case.

00:06:23.809 --> 00:06:25.850
Huang Yue secured
two lawyer pool assignments.

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:28.689
Ren Jiatong's report
was exceptionally good.

00:06:29.049 --> 00:06:30.570
After lengthy discussions

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:32.010
this afternoon,

00:06:32.369 --> 00:06:33.570
the mentors decided

00:06:33.929 --> 00:06:36.010
to give you three an oral exam
tomorrow morning.

00:07:35.809 --> 00:07:36.530
Hi, Mom.

00:07:37.489 --> 00:07:38.129
Jiatong.

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:40.450
How's work been lately?

00:07:41.169 --> 00:07:44.330
Mom, about the surgery fee,

00:07:44.489 --> 00:07:45.609
I transferred you 30,000,

00:07:46.289 --> 00:07:47.570
but they only received half.

00:07:48.129 --> 00:07:49.010
Where's the rest?

00:07:52.489 --> 00:07:55.330
I was just temporarily short on cash.

00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:56.249
So I kept...

00:07:57.450 --> 00:07:58.090
What's wrong?

00:07:59.369 --> 00:08:00.369
They harassed you again?

00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:04.129
They're total bloodsuckers!

00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:06.090
Mom!

00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:09.570
Who's the real bloodsucker?

00:08:10.249 --> 00:08:12.289
I took online loans to get that money.

00:08:12.289 --> 00:08:14.090
You spent it without even telling me?

00:08:14.169 --> 00:08:15.530
Don't blame me.

00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:16.530
You should

00:08:16.609 --> 00:08:17.369
blame your dad.

00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:18.650
What about him?

00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:19.609
Don't bring him up.

00:08:19.809 --> 00:08:20.689
What about him?

00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:21.609
The lawyers

00:08:21.609 --> 00:08:23.289
they hired pressed your dad to death,

00:08:23.410 --> 00:08:24.689
so I became like this.

00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:27.090
I can't even spend my own money.

00:08:27.609 --> 00:08:29.570
Your dad's pride destroyed him!

00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:31.889
Dad bears responsibility too.

00:08:32.050 --> 00:08:34.090
You can't just blame the lawyers.

00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:37.249
Their lawyers pressured him

00:08:37.249 --> 00:08:37.930
to death.

00:08:38.489 --> 00:08:39.690
If I had any choice,

00:08:39.889 --> 00:08:41.170
I'd never let you be a lawyer!

00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:42.129
All my life,

00:08:42.170 --> 00:08:43.330
I've hated lawyers!

00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:09.450
Ren Jiatong, relax.

00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:11.970
Today's assessment topic

00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:13.889
is whether Ms. Tan
should take the endorsement

00:09:13.889 --> 00:09:14.889
from a legal viewpoint.

00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:16.889
If you're ready,

00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:17.690
we'll start.

00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:21.009
I'm ready.

00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:24.009
Good. Present your analysis.

00:09:24.769 --> 00:09:25.489
I agree

00:09:25.609 --> 00:09:27.050
that these gummy products

00:09:27.050 --> 00:09:28.450
have no quality issues

00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:30.009
and meet all manufacturing

00:09:30.009 --> 00:09:32.409
qualification requirements.

00:09:32.649 --> 00:09:33.609
But your report states

00:09:33.609 --> 00:09:34.850
that we shouldn't recommend

00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:36.690
the Q Candy series endorsement.

00:09:36.729 --> 00:09:37.210
Why?

00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:40.009
Q Candy series targets children,

00:09:40.489 --> 00:09:42.170
and their ads claim

00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:44.050
the products can

00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:45.369
enhance children's memory.

00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:46.649
However, I believe

00:09:46.649 --> 00:09:49.170
there are two legal risks.

00:09:49.729 --> 00:09:51.489
First, the Advertising Law stipulates

00:09:51.729 --> 00:09:52.810
that endorsers can only

00:09:52.810 --> 00:09:54.889
promote products
they've personally used.

00:09:55.129 --> 00:09:57.009
Ms. Tan is single

00:09:57.050 --> 00:09:58.050
with no children,

00:09:58.369 --> 00:10:00.330
making it impossible

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:02.369
to genuinely test
the claimed memory benefits.

00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:05.210
This risks regulatory violation

00:10:05.210 --> 00:10:07.050
under the Advertising Law.

00:10:07.729 --> 00:10:09.690
Second, this product

00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:11.769
may break health supplement regulations.

00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:13.369
The Advertising Law

00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:15.009
prohibits health supplements

00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:16.690
from using celebrity endorsements.

00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:20.690
If it's not a health supplement,

00:10:21.769 --> 00:10:22.930
isn't that fine?

00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:24.330
Correct.

00:10:24.609 --> 00:10:26.889
The Q Candy series
isn't classified as such.

00:10:27.249 --> 00:10:28.330
I verified the information

00:10:28.369 --> 00:10:30.609
on the website of State Administration

00:10:30.609 --> 00:10:31.609
for Market Regulation.

00:10:32.009 --> 00:10:33.129
But the core issue is,

00:10:33.369 --> 00:10:36.009
the memory improvement function
it claims

00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:38.609
falls under the health functions
for dietary supplements.

00:10:39.129 --> 00:10:41.210
This product isn't classified
as a dietary supplement

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:43.970
yet it's illegally
claiming health benefits.

00:10:44.369 --> 00:10:45.810
This makes it highly likely

00:10:45.970 --> 00:10:47.330
to be deemed as false advertising.

00:10:47.489 --> 00:10:49.210
If it's ruled as false advertising,

00:10:49.450 --> 00:10:51.170
then Ms. Tan, as the endorser,

00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:53.290
would face
severe administrative penalties.

00:10:55.970 --> 00:10:57.769
The previous lawyer handling this case

00:10:57.769 --> 00:10:59.290
identified this critical flaw

00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:01.729
and promptly informed the client
of the legal risks.

00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:03.729
The client was very satisfied
with the outcome.

00:11:04.489 --> 00:11:05.210
Thank you.

00:11:21.649 --> 00:11:22.249
Let me check.

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:23.048
Go ahead.

00:11:25.729 --> 00:11:27.009
Did I say something wrong?

00:11:30.810 --> 00:11:31.570
You may leave.

00:11:49.769 --> 00:11:50.504
How did it go?

00:11:50.570 --> 00:11:51.649
What did they say?

00:11:56.649 --> 00:11:57.769
They just asked me to leave.

00:11:58.889 --> 00:11:59.649
I'll wait for news.

00:12:16.889 --> 00:12:17.409
Guo Xiaoyu.

00:12:18.489 --> 00:12:20.409
I didn't mean to ignore you last night.

00:12:21.609 --> 00:12:23.330
I just didn't know what to say.

00:12:24.729 --> 00:12:25.450
I understand.

00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:26.810
I'm not blaming you.

00:12:28.050 --> 00:12:30.290
I'm not as capable as the rest of you.

00:12:32.249 --> 00:12:32.850
Don't worry.

00:12:33.649 --> 00:12:34.649
Even if I leave,

00:12:34.970 --> 00:12:36.450
I won't give up on becoming a lawyer.

00:12:39.129 --> 00:12:40.050
You might not leave.

00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:42.450
Ms. Bai didn't seem pleased

00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:44.210
with my performance just now.

00:13:01.570 --> 00:13:02.769
Wang Lu, come in for a moment.

00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:27.528
Have a seat.

00:13:34.489 --> 00:13:35.336
Wang Lu.

00:13:36.264 --> 00:13:37.369
I called you in

00:13:37.369 --> 00:13:38.930
for your due diligence report.

00:13:39.450 --> 00:13:40.690
We have questions for you.

00:13:44.369 --> 00:13:46.489
Are you familiar

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:48.529
with the SAMR'S website?

00:13:52.529 --> 00:13:54.249
Ren Jiatong said
that she got information

00:13:54.369 --> 00:13:55.609
through this website

00:13:55.930 --> 00:13:57.416
to verify that the Q Candy series

00:13:57.416 --> 00:13:59.016
lacks dietary supplement certification.

00:13:59.369 --> 00:14:00.489
Your report also mentions

00:14:00.889 --> 00:14:01.704
the same conclusion.

00:14:02.930 --> 00:14:04.090
But the website you cited

00:14:04.690 --> 00:14:06.529
belongs to
the Food and Drug Administration.

00:14:07.970 --> 00:14:09.249
If I'm not mistaken,

00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:10.970
after the SAMR was established,

00:14:11.249 --> 00:14:12.649
the FDA was dissolved.

00:14:13.369 --> 00:14:17.448
All data migrated
to the current SAMR website.

00:14:19.409 --> 00:14:20.249
Any explanations?

00:14:25.090 --> 00:14:25.690
I...

00:14:25.690 --> 00:14:27.330
Had you actually visited the website

00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:30.249
while preparing this report,

00:14:31.009 --> 00:14:31.970
you would have noticed

00:14:32.369 --> 00:14:34.889
the webpage is no longer functional.

00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:39.009
Now, what's your explanation for this?

00:14:55.970 --> 00:14:56.744
I'm sorry.

00:14:58.529 --> 00:14:59.528
The website reference

00:15:00.009 --> 00:15:01.330
wasn't my original research.

00:15:03.529 --> 00:15:04.290
This conclusion

00:15:05.050 --> 00:15:06.210
was adapted

00:15:06.210 --> 00:15:08.210
from previous case from the lead lawyer.

00:15:09.690 --> 00:15:11.529
Unaware of
the administrative reorganization,

00:15:11.609 --> 00:15:12.889
I just copied the old reference.

00:15:14.409 --> 00:15:15.330
So you're admitting

00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:16.729
you had prior access to this case?

00:15:20.970 --> 00:15:22.729
When I just joined Jun An,

00:15:23.050 --> 00:15:25.529
the firm organized training sessions
for junior lawyers

00:15:25.570 --> 00:15:26.570
and interns.

00:15:27.090 --> 00:15:29.009
The lead lawyer on this case

00:15:29.369 --> 00:15:30.290
conducted our training.

00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:32.170
He shared this case with us

00:15:32.649 --> 00:15:33.729
and I memorized it.

00:15:35.369 --> 00:15:37.769
When given this assessment task,

00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:42.529
I immediately recognized the approach.

00:15:43.649 --> 00:15:45.649
Yet you failed
to disclose this advantage.

00:15:46.409 --> 00:15:47.529
I desired to win.

00:15:47.649 --> 00:15:48.450
Your failing

00:15:48.450 --> 00:15:50.609
lies in plagiarizing another's work

00:15:51.369 --> 00:15:53.170
without proper attribution.

00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:55.690
Prior exposure by sheer coincidence

00:15:55.889 --> 00:15:57.050
wouldn't be an issue.

00:15:57.489 --> 00:15:59.009
You can use it

00:15:59.009 --> 00:15:59.690
to do better.

00:16:01.249 --> 00:16:04.456
But you crossed the lines.

00:16:06.050 --> 00:16:07.784
Your desire to win is admirable.

00:16:08.009 --> 00:16:09.489
But as legal professionals,

00:16:09.850 --> 00:16:10.970
we uphold justice

00:16:11.450 --> 00:16:12.970
and respect established rules

00:16:13.409 --> 00:16:14.889
through actions, not just words.

00:16:19.970 --> 00:16:20.649
So, Wang Lu,

00:16:21.570 --> 00:16:22.529
your scores are invalid.

00:16:31.249 --> 00:16:31.944
Mr. Zhuang.

00:16:32.850 --> 00:16:34.850
If I get eliminated
from the Talent Hunt Program,

00:16:35.210 --> 00:16:37.090
can I revert to being a regular intern

00:16:37.170 --> 00:16:39.249
and continue my internship
with my original team?

00:16:48.810 --> 00:16:49.330
Wang Lu.

00:16:50.725 --> 00:16:52.005
I explained your situation

00:16:53.489 --> 00:16:55.330
to your mentor lawyer.

00:16:56.850 --> 00:16:58.009
He sent me a message.

00:16:59.170 --> 00:17:00.050
Let me read it here.

00:17:01.889 --> 00:17:02.609
Mr. Zhuang.

00:17:03.529 --> 00:17:06.010
During Wang Lu's internship,

00:17:06.810 --> 00:17:08.010
he consistently did well.

00:17:09.290 --> 00:17:11.050
All senior lawyers who worked with him

00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:13.449
have praised him.

00:17:14.649 --> 00:17:16.209
In this program assessment,

00:17:16.209 --> 00:17:18.290
Wang Lu's actions were indeed improper.

00:17:19.050 --> 00:17:19.649
But I believe

00:17:19.730 --> 00:17:22.929
there's a fundamental difference
from outright cheating.

00:17:24.250 --> 00:17:26.609
Mr. Zhuang, please don't think
I'm showing favoritism.

00:17:27.969 --> 00:17:29.609
As seasoned lawyers, we all understand

00:17:29.889 --> 00:17:32.090
that learning
from senior colleagues' experience

00:17:32.090 --> 00:17:33.649
is inherent to our profession.

00:17:34.010 --> 00:17:35.730
It's how generations of newcomers

00:17:35.730 --> 00:17:37.290
strive to improve.

00:17:38.050 --> 00:17:39.050
While we can't deny

00:17:40.090 --> 00:17:41.609
that Wang Lu's concealment this time

00:17:41.609 --> 00:17:44.290
compromised the assessment's fairness,

00:17:45.290 --> 00:17:46.129
Jun An is a firm

00:17:46.250 --> 00:17:48.730
that invests in young talent

00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:49.730
and nurtures growth.

00:17:50.169 --> 00:17:51.810
We don't completely dismiss someone

00:17:52.369 --> 00:17:53.330
for a single mistake.

00:17:54.850 --> 00:17:56.649
Therefore, I boldly request

00:17:56.969 --> 00:17:59.889
that if Wang Lu gets eliminated
from the Talent Hunt Program,

00:18:00.810 --> 00:18:02.609
Jun An could give him another chance.

00:18:02.969 --> 00:18:03.490
Let him know

00:18:04.290 --> 00:18:05.530
Jun An won't give up on him.

00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:07.169
Our team members

00:18:07.609 --> 00:18:09.689
still welcome his return.

00:18:29.010 --> 00:18:31.010
Thank you all
for your tolerance and guidance.

00:18:32.609 --> 00:18:34.409
However, I've always been someone

00:18:35.290 --> 00:18:36.889
who pursued personal excellence

00:18:37.689 --> 00:18:38.770
without regard for others.

00:18:40.369 --> 00:18:41.850
Today, Jun An taught me a lesson.

00:18:43.129 --> 00:18:44.129
I'll remember forever.

00:18:47.730 --> 00:18:48.290
I will

00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:50.969
take responsibility for my mistake.

00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:55.400
I've decided to leave.

00:19:31.770 --> 00:19:33.928
Regarding the three of you
staying or leaving,

00:19:34.369 --> 00:19:35.770
after the discussions,

00:19:36.010 --> 00:19:37.575
Mr. Zhuang has decided all three of you

00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:39.090
go into the next round.

00:19:47.050 --> 00:19:47.850
The one eliminated

00:19:48.609 --> 00:19:49.320
is Wang Lu.

00:19:52.649 --> 00:19:53.290
Wang Lu?

00:19:54.209 --> 00:19:54.889
What happened?

00:19:55.929 --> 00:19:57.250
He had heard of this case

00:19:57.449 --> 00:19:58.969
before the competition began.

00:19:59.369 --> 00:20:00.649
Since he failed to report it,

00:20:00.850 --> 00:20:03.090
his competition results are voided.

00:20:04.570 --> 00:20:06.530
His scores are invalidated
and he's leaving?

00:20:15.530 --> 00:20:16.810
Your round isn't over yet.

00:20:17.449 --> 00:20:18.344
There's grouping.

00:20:18.929 --> 00:20:21.129
Mr. Zhou, how will grouping work?

00:20:21.209 --> 00:20:22.090
Another assessment?

00:20:22.449 --> 00:20:23.050
No assessments.

00:20:23.490 --> 00:20:24.969
It's like choosing graduate advisors,

00:20:25.290 --> 00:20:26.010
mutual selection.

00:20:27.730 --> 00:20:28.250
Thanks.

00:20:28.689 --> 00:20:30.369
Remember
to fill out the preference form.

00:20:30.770 --> 00:20:32.530
Results will be emailed Sunday night.

00:20:33.889 --> 00:20:36.209
Mutual selection?
What if Mr. Song doesn't choose me?

00:20:37.209 --> 00:20:38.649
You already know whom you choose?

00:20:40.449 --> 00:20:41.449
Mr. Zhou,

00:20:41.449 --> 00:20:42.969
are there any restrictions?

00:20:44.490 --> 00:20:45.850
No formal restrictions.

00:20:47.889 --> 00:20:48.490
Ms. Tian, come.

00:20:50.330 --> 00:20:51.250
Let me introduce her.

00:20:51.649 --> 00:20:52.730
This is

00:20:52.850 --> 00:20:54.730
a fourth-year lawyer Tian Min.

00:20:55.010 --> 00:20:55.912
From Ms. Bai's team.

00:20:56.490 --> 00:20:57.544
- Hello, Ms. Tian.
- Hello, Ms. Tian.

00:20:57.544 --> 00:20:58.449
- Hello, Ms. Tian.
- Hello, Ms. Tian.

00:20:58.530 --> 00:20:59.090
Hello, guys.

00:20:59.929 --> 00:21:01.810
Regarding the restrictions,

00:21:01.810 --> 00:21:02.889
there aren't any.

00:21:03.330 --> 00:21:06.090
But the unspoken limit would be

00:21:06.090 --> 00:21:07.369
that Ms. Bai's team

00:21:07.369 --> 00:21:09.090
has very few intern spots annually.

00:21:10.010 --> 00:21:11.090
It's not officially stated,

00:21:11.090 --> 00:21:13.090
but they accept
only one new member per year.

00:21:13.090 --> 00:21:13.850
Right, Ms. Tian?

00:21:17.050 --> 00:21:18.530
In my four years at Jun An,

00:21:18.770 --> 00:21:20.969
our team has taken
only one newcomer annually.

00:21:22.209 --> 00:21:24.209
But I haven't confirmed with Ms. Bai yet

00:21:24.889 --> 00:21:26.090
about that rule for this year.

00:21:26.929 --> 00:21:27.850
- What about Mr. Song?
- What about Mr. Zhuang?

00:21:28.850 --> 00:21:29.969
Mr. Song and Mr. Zhuang

00:21:29.969 --> 00:21:31.330
have no specific rules.

00:21:32.010 --> 00:21:33.969
But the principle is
quality over quantity.

00:21:34.730 --> 00:21:35.449
So if you already

00:21:35.449 --> 00:21:37.090
have a clear choice in mind,

00:21:37.810 --> 00:21:39.689
you should showcase yourselves
around them.

00:21:39.929 --> 00:21:40.570
Trust me.

00:21:41.570 --> 00:21:42.730
Got it. Thanks, Mr. Zhou.

00:21:47.609 --> 00:21:48.090
Let's go.

00:21:50.409 --> 00:21:51.129
Bye-bye, Mr. Zhou.

00:22:04.449 --> 00:22:05.010
Wang Lu.

00:22:05.850 --> 00:22:07.880
Want to grab lunch together?

00:22:08.199 --> 00:22:09.449
At the restaurant downstairs.

00:22:09.449 --> 00:22:10.129
Yeah, great food.

00:22:11.929 --> 00:22:12.850
You guys go ahead.

00:22:13.209 --> 00:22:13.969
I'll go later.

00:22:16.169 --> 00:22:17.689
Are you coming back up afterward?

00:22:20.409 --> 00:22:21.050
Probably not.

00:22:27.169 --> 00:22:28.330
How about we go down first

00:22:28.330 --> 00:22:29.288
and save you a seat?

00:22:29.288 --> 00:22:30.504
We'll order your favorites.

00:22:30.649 --> 00:22:31.816
Come down quickly.

00:22:34.169 --> 00:22:34.728
Okay.

00:22:37.010 --> 00:22:38.609
Alright, let's head out.

00:22:38.889 --> 00:22:39.409
Come on.

00:22:39.929 --> 00:22:40.680
Come on.

00:22:41.330 --> 00:22:41.928
Let's go.

00:22:47.090 --> 00:22:47.688
Go.

00:22:51.449 --> 00:22:52.552
Come down soon.

00:22:52.730 --> 00:22:53.416
See you later.

00:23:11.530 --> 00:23:12.810
Wang Lu is actually leaving?

00:23:13.490 --> 00:23:14.609
This feels awful.

00:23:16.929 --> 00:23:17.889
Look at the bright side.

00:23:17.889 --> 00:23:19.730
Every competition
has winners and losers.

00:23:20.010 --> 00:23:20.889
If he didn't leave,

00:23:21.169 --> 00:23:22.730
you'd be the one leaving.

00:23:25.810 --> 00:23:26.689
Focus on

00:23:26.689 --> 00:23:27.810
how to choose your mentor

00:23:27.810 --> 00:23:28.889
who can help you stay.

00:23:29.649 --> 00:23:30.770
I'll choose Mr. Song.

00:23:31.290 --> 00:23:31.944
What about you?

00:23:32.929 --> 00:23:34.530
I'm set on Mr. Zhuang.

00:23:34.889 --> 00:23:36.010
Don't compete with me.

00:23:36.730 --> 00:23:38.290
I'm still undecided.

00:23:39.169 --> 00:23:40.530
But I won't pick Ms. Bai for sure.

00:23:41.290 --> 00:23:42.250
I'm afraid of her.

00:23:43.850 --> 00:23:44.649
Fei, what about you?

00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:46.850
Me?

00:23:48.409 --> 00:23:49.730
It doesn't matter who I choose.

00:23:52.449 --> 00:23:53.810
- What about you?
- Ms. Bai.

00:23:54.730 --> 00:23:56.770
I've never done
any dispute resolution case.

00:23:56.850 --> 00:23:57.449
Want to try it.

00:23:58.530 --> 00:23:59.304
Are you crazy?

00:23:59.912 --> 00:24:01.288
All your non-litigation experience

00:24:01.288 --> 00:24:02.792
from the US firm counts for nothing?

00:24:02.792 --> 00:24:03.609
Switching fields?

00:24:03.609 --> 00:24:06.290
The fun is in trying new things.

00:24:06.290 --> 00:24:08.169
I wouldn't even dare think like that.

00:24:08.810 --> 00:24:10.664
Choosing to be a lawyer
over a civil servant

00:24:10.664 --> 00:24:12.290
is my biggest rebellion ever.

00:24:12.850 --> 00:24:13.889
My whole family,

00:24:13.889 --> 00:24:15.490
especially my parents, are furious.

00:24:16.050 --> 00:24:17.192
Only my sister supports me.

00:24:17.330 --> 00:24:18.920
I can't lose. I must play safe.

00:24:19.449 --> 00:24:21.352
Jiang Chen, you're picking Ms. Bai?

00:24:21.730 --> 00:24:23.592
You'll be competing with Jiatong then.

00:24:26.449 --> 00:24:27.720
I might not choose Ms. Bai.

00:24:30.810 --> 00:24:31.560
Well...

00:24:32.050 --> 00:24:33.960
Just don't pick Mr. Zhuang either.

00:24:36.409 --> 00:24:37.889
Seems I'm the only true fan here.

00:24:37.889 --> 00:24:39.016
Never changed my choice.

00:24:39.330 --> 00:24:40.488
If Mr. Song doesn't pick me,

00:24:40.488 --> 00:24:41.800
that's his loss.

00:24:46.209 --> 00:24:47.304
What took Wang Lu so long?

00:24:47.530 --> 00:24:48.570
We need to order food.

00:24:50.010 --> 00:24:50.770
I'll text him.

00:24:52.689 --> 00:24:53.736
Check the group chat.

00:24:53.889 --> 00:24:54.889
He says he left already.

00:24:58.330 --> 00:24:59.050
He left the group.

00:26:03.816 --> 00:26:05.864
(Wang Lu)

00:26:34.010 --> 00:26:36.250
You were so active to work with Ms. Bai.

00:26:36.649 --> 00:26:38.050
Why not choose her now?

00:26:38.209 --> 00:26:39.409
It's not like you at all.

00:26:43.050 --> 00:26:44.490
Are you scared of competing with me?

00:26:48.010 --> 00:26:50.409
Didn't Mr. Zhou say
Ms. Bai only takes one mentee per year?

00:26:51.090 --> 00:26:52.050
If I choose her,

00:26:52.050 --> 00:26:53.570
you might have no chance at all.

00:26:54.050 --> 00:26:54.969
Think about it.

00:26:55.570 --> 00:26:56.850
I might be letting you win.

00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:13.672
(Bai Xiao)

00:27:22.888 --> 00:27:25.768
Actually, I came to tell you

00:27:25.768 --> 00:27:27.016
that you're really pretty.

00:27:31.688 --> 00:27:32.727
(Song Yifan)

00:28:10.810 --> 00:28:12.810
(Mr. Zhou, I'm free right now.)

00:28:13.090 --> 00:28:14.689
(Need any help with your work?)

00:28:15.250 --> 00:28:16.050
(Not much work.)

00:28:16.570 --> 00:28:17.096
(Thanks.)

00:28:22.730 --> 00:28:24.330
So busy today I didn't even drink water.

00:28:24.770 --> 00:28:25.889
The weather is so dry.

00:28:25.889 --> 00:28:27.129
My lips are chapped.

00:28:27.730 --> 00:28:28.770
Need any help?

00:28:28.889 --> 00:28:29.730
I'm super free today.

00:28:29.730 --> 00:28:30.570
I have nothing to do.

00:28:31.010 --> 00:28:33.209
I'm fine. I'm busy
working on the law article.

00:28:33.570 --> 00:28:34.250
Almost done.

00:28:34.929 --> 00:28:35.490
Law article?

00:28:35.969 --> 00:28:37.969
When did you get involved
with law promotion?

00:28:40.209 --> 00:28:40.889
Didn't you know?

00:28:41.929 --> 00:28:44.129
Mr. Zhou said their team is overloaded.

00:28:44.490 --> 00:28:46.169
But we need daily updates
for law articles.

00:28:46.290 --> 00:28:47.969
So we all need to write an article.

00:28:48.250 --> 00:28:49.224
I got scheduled first.

00:28:50.209 --> 00:28:51.050
All of us?

00:28:54.344 --> 00:28:55.112
I'm off.

00:29:05.090 --> 00:29:05.576
Here.

00:29:11.530 --> 00:29:12.290
Jacqueline du Pre.

00:29:13.090 --> 00:29:13.649
I like it.

00:29:14.290 --> 00:29:15.369
During my business trip,

00:29:15.530 --> 00:29:16.290
I bought it.

00:29:17.169 --> 00:29:19.209
Elgar's Cello Concerto in E Minor.

00:29:19.250 --> 00:29:21.090
You're still not tired
of listening to this?

00:29:22.209 --> 00:29:23.689
Thanks. If new figures

00:29:23.689 --> 00:29:25.050
from The Outcast series came out,

00:29:25.050 --> 00:29:26.056
I'll buy them for you.

00:29:27.609 --> 00:29:28.530
It's my only hobby.

00:29:28.850 --> 00:29:29.929
The whole firm knows it.

00:29:31.609 --> 00:29:32.330
Guo Xiaoyu came

00:29:32.770 --> 00:29:34.169
to me for team assignments,

00:29:34.409 --> 00:29:36.770
but ended up talking about The Outcast
for half an hour.

00:29:40.250 --> 00:29:40.969
Guo Xiaoyu?

00:29:41.369 --> 00:29:43.530
I think this girl matches your style.

00:29:45.209 --> 00:29:46.850
Just say directly if you're mocking me.

00:29:47.209 --> 00:29:48.090
I won't mind.

00:29:51.129 --> 00:29:52.010
Those kids are good.

00:29:52.850 --> 00:29:54.129
Who do you want to pick?

00:30:00.369 --> 00:30:00.969
Ren Jiatong?

00:30:03.409 --> 00:30:06.169
By the way,
during the last elimination round,

00:30:06.449 --> 00:30:08.409
weren't you originally
supporting Guo Xiaoyu?

00:30:08.409 --> 00:30:10.409
Why did you change your vote to approve

00:30:10.409 --> 00:30:12.290
giving Ren Jiatong another chance?

00:30:13.929 --> 00:30:14.929
I think she

00:30:15.449 --> 00:30:16.889
reminds me of your younger self.

00:30:17.449 --> 00:30:19.850
That's why I wanted
to give her another chance.

00:30:20.570 --> 00:30:21.889
This is pure retaliation.

00:30:22.490 --> 00:30:24.649
You just want to say
I'm as stubborn as her.

00:30:24.929 --> 00:30:26.169
Are you not stubborn?

00:30:26.730 --> 00:30:28.570
We've rescheduled dinner
a hundred times.

00:30:29.209 --> 00:30:30.169
Finally, it happened.

00:30:30.449 --> 00:30:31.592
Yet it's a working lunch.

00:30:31.730 --> 00:30:33.129
Right next to the law firm.

00:30:33.530 --> 00:30:35.290
Who else could be this stubborn?

00:30:35.730 --> 00:30:36.609
Let me ask you.

00:30:37.010 --> 00:30:38.369
You still read comics at your age?

00:30:38.969 --> 00:30:41.050
Even my daughter reads comics now.

00:30:41.449 --> 00:30:42.369
You and I

00:30:42.369 --> 00:30:43.490
have a generation gap.

00:30:43.490 --> 00:30:44.169
We're different.

00:30:44.169 --> 00:30:44.810
Alright.

00:30:44.810 --> 00:30:45.810
You win the argument.

00:30:46.129 --> 00:30:46.730
Let's eat.

00:30:54.889 --> 00:30:56.090
I think Ren Jiatong is good.

00:30:57.570 --> 00:31:00.090
If you don't want her, I'll pick her.

00:31:01.290 --> 00:31:02.050
She's indeed good.

00:31:02.889 --> 00:31:04.010
But that boy is good too.

00:31:04.570 --> 00:31:05.290
I need to think.

00:31:08.290 --> 00:31:08.904
Drink.

00:31:13.730 --> 00:31:15.208
You're really not choosing Ms. Bai?

00:31:21.490 --> 00:31:23.169
Actually, I admire Ms. Bai,

00:31:23.649 --> 00:31:25.010
but she doesn't seem to like me.

00:31:25.889 --> 00:31:27.272
Yesterday, my submission was late.

00:31:27.272 --> 00:31:28.360
When I went to explain,

00:31:28.649 --> 00:31:30.449
she lectured me sternly

00:31:30.689 --> 00:31:31.570
and didn't help.

00:31:32.129 --> 00:31:33.512
During the medical dispute case,

00:31:33.512 --> 00:31:34.728
I contributed significantly

00:31:34.728 --> 00:31:36.008
but she didn't seem to remember.

00:31:36.490 --> 00:31:38.056
Probably, she just doesn't like me.

00:31:40.168 --> 00:31:40.808
Ms. Bai...

00:31:40.808 --> 00:31:42.290
In the end, Wang Lu messed up,

00:31:42.570 --> 00:31:44.609
and Mr. Song counted half my score,

00:31:44.649 --> 00:31:46.689
barely letting me stay as last place.

00:31:48.090 --> 00:31:49.730
After all this thinking,

00:31:50.010 --> 00:31:51.730
choosing Mr. Song seems safer.

00:31:54.369 --> 00:31:55.889
So, both of us will choose Mr. Song?

00:31:55.889 --> 00:31:56.530
That seems good.

00:31:56.969 --> 00:31:58.536
Mr. Song will take multiple people.

00:31:59.050 --> 00:31:59.730
That's great!

00:31:59.730 --> 00:32:01.290
We'll likely be in the same team.

00:32:04.369 --> 00:32:07.129
Then I can copy your work

00:32:07.129 --> 00:32:08.490
and cruise to the finale.

00:32:09.050 --> 00:32:10.770
I might not even survive
till the finale.

00:32:11.449 --> 00:32:12.360
Don't dream.

00:32:13.449 --> 00:32:15.080
Why so gloomy today?

00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:15.912
It's not like you.

00:32:20.889 --> 00:32:23.050
Your law article is good.

00:32:24.369 --> 00:32:25.209
Absolutely.

00:32:25.730 --> 00:32:27.609
I always work on quality content.

00:32:28.490 --> 00:32:29.449
Share it in your Moments

00:32:29.810 --> 00:32:30.856
and add the caption,

00:32:31.290 --> 00:32:34.248
masterpiece from a legal prodigy.

00:32:36.250 --> 00:32:37.649
Oh please, prodigy?

00:32:37.649 --> 00:32:38.689
I shared it too early.

00:32:39.330 --> 00:32:40.689
Next time, I'll use your caption.

00:32:45.330 --> 00:32:45.969
Let me tell you.

00:32:46.250 --> 00:32:47.169
I just found out today.

00:32:47.649 --> 00:32:50.050
Yan Fei doesn't have
to handle the social media tasks.

00:32:50.889 --> 00:32:52.730
She learned about this today herself.

00:32:53.169 --> 00:32:54.969
She even went to ask Mr. Zhou.

00:32:55.409 --> 00:32:56.169
Isn't that crazy?

00:32:56.969 --> 00:32:58.090
Isn't that obvious?

00:32:58.169 --> 00:32:59.730
Her family must've pulled strings.

00:33:00.330 --> 00:33:01.090
You're amazing.

00:33:01.090 --> 00:33:01.889
How did you know?

00:33:02.609 --> 00:33:04.090
Grunt work like this

00:33:04.129 --> 00:33:05.649
is always handled by newbies.

00:33:06.129 --> 00:33:07.090
Yan Fei's family

00:33:07.090 --> 00:33:08.889
would never let her do this.

00:33:10.290 --> 00:33:11.649
But given Yan Fei's personality,

00:33:12.129 --> 00:33:14.570
Zhou Nian probably
got an earful from her today.

00:33:16.129 --> 00:33:16.850
Ren Jiatong.

00:33:17.250 --> 00:33:18.850
You're a psychology genius.

00:33:31.409 --> 00:33:32.010
Hey, Mom.

00:33:32.209 --> 00:33:34.730
Jiatong, I saw the article
you just posted in Moments.

00:33:35.169 --> 00:33:36.649
There's a photo of a female lawyer.

00:33:36.649 --> 00:33:37.960
Is she from Jun An?

00:33:38.050 --> 00:33:39.688
What photo? Which one?

00:33:40.409 --> 00:33:41.928
The female lawyer.

00:33:42.010 --> 00:33:42.888
Why?

00:33:43.169 --> 00:33:44.040
Hold on.

00:33:48.010 --> 00:33:49.192
(Bai Xiao)
You mean Ms. Bai?

00:33:50.250 --> 00:33:51.209
I told you before.

00:33:51.570 --> 00:33:53.209
The lawyer who drove your dad to death

00:33:53.369 --> 00:33:54.129
is her.

00:33:55.689 --> 00:33:58.344
(Bai Xiao)
Mom, are you sure you're not mistaken?

00:33:59.649 --> 00:34:01.169
I reviewed the case files before.

00:34:01.330 --> 00:34:02.649
The lead lawyer on my dad's case

00:34:02.649 --> 00:34:03.649
was a male lawyer.

00:34:03.969 --> 00:34:04.929
I'm certain.

00:34:05.369 --> 00:34:06.689
She's the one pressing your dad.

00:34:07.250 --> 00:34:08.650
Her face is not easily forgotten.

00:34:13.850 --> 00:34:14.449
Excuse me.

00:34:19.650 --> 00:34:21.049
Let me verify the facts.

00:34:30.696 --> 00:34:33.448

(Qing City Intermediate People's Court,

00:34:43.208 --> 00:34:47.368
(Lawyer: Wang Qin, Manyida Law Firm;
Lawyer: Xu Ya, Manyida Law Firm)

00:35:02.690 --> 00:35:03.610
What's up?

00:35:03.770 --> 00:35:04.369
Good morning.

00:35:04.730 --> 00:35:05.929
I have a question to ask you.

00:35:06.089 --> 00:35:06.489
Go ahead.

00:35:08.134 --> 00:35:09.864
For ordinary cases,
the representing lawyers

00:35:09.864 --> 00:35:11.489
always sign the case documents, right?

00:35:11.489 --> 00:35:13.320
Are there situations
where names get omitted?

00:35:14.049 --> 00:35:14.929
Generally not.

00:35:15.330 --> 00:35:16.449
For law professionals,

00:35:16.569 --> 00:35:17.969
attention to detail matters.

00:35:18.369 --> 00:35:19.170
Even if some files

00:35:19.170 --> 00:35:20.889
only have partial lawyer signatures,

00:35:21.049 --> 00:35:22.489
the court judgment paperwork

00:35:22.489 --> 00:35:24.409
will list
all legal representatives in full,

00:35:25.610 --> 00:35:27.208
except under special circumstances.

00:35:27.650 --> 00:35:28.584
What circumstances?

00:35:28.969 --> 00:35:29.770
Like when someone

00:35:29.770 --> 00:35:31.610
recently leaves a court
or prosecutor's office

00:35:31.929 --> 00:35:33.170
and joins a law firm,

00:35:33.569 --> 00:35:34.969
by regulation, they can't practice

00:35:34.969 --> 00:35:36.489
as lawyers for two years

00:35:36.690 --> 00:35:37.730
in related cases.

00:35:38.089 --> 00:35:39.250
In such cases,

00:35:39.250 --> 00:35:40.489
they will serve as consultants

00:35:40.489 --> 00:35:41.290
in certain cases

00:35:41.290 --> 00:35:42.730
without official attribution.

00:35:43.330 --> 00:35:45.690
But the lawyers
who join firms after graduation

00:35:45.690 --> 00:35:46.850
won't have this issue, right?

00:35:47.290 --> 00:35:48.009
Probably not.

00:35:50.130 --> 00:35:50.810
Thank you.

00:35:54.130 --> 00:35:55.449
Oh, there's another scenario.

00:36:04.089 --> 00:36:06.449
Yan Fei,
why are you choosing Mr. Song too?

00:36:08.489 --> 00:36:09.770
I've always been interested

00:36:09.770 --> 00:36:11.369
in mergers and acquisitions.

00:36:11.369 --> 00:36:12.650
Plus, Mr. Song is charming

00:36:12.650 --> 00:36:14.152
and has the most stylish office.

00:36:14.969 --> 00:36:15.880
Then I'm doomed.

00:36:16.456 --> 00:36:18.409
You, Ren Jiatong, and I

00:36:18.409 --> 00:36:20.040
all picked Mr. Song.

00:36:20.232 --> 00:36:22.344
If he only selects two people,

00:36:22.650 --> 00:36:24.264
I'll definitely be the one cut.

00:36:25.730 --> 00:36:27.009
Do you remember what they said

00:36:27.009 --> 00:36:28.089
when we just came?

00:36:28.089 --> 00:36:28.889
Ms. Bai and Mr. Song

00:36:29.210 --> 00:36:30.290
joined Jun An

00:36:30.290 --> 00:36:31.880
right after graduation?

00:36:32.552 --> 00:36:33.128
Yeah.

00:36:33.704 --> 00:36:37.032
Mr. Song said that as Jun An's babies,
they came through on-campus recruitment.

00:36:37.409 --> 00:36:37.929
Besides,

00:36:38.850 --> 00:36:40.489
they were known

00:36:40.489 --> 00:36:41.569
as the best partners.

00:36:46.449 --> 00:36:47.560
Fei.

00:36:47.889 --> 00:36:50.216
(Xiaojie)
Think twice.

00:36:51.049 --> 00:36:53.089
What? Don't want to be in my group?

00:36:55.610 --> 00:36:56.610
Who should I pick then?

00:37:05.330 --> 00:37:05.928
Hello.

00:37:06.409 --> 00:37:07.880
Jiatong, I passed.

00:37:08.449 --> 00:37:09.969
What you wrote for me is great.

00:37:09.969 --> 00:37:10.730
You're the best.

00:37:11.409 --> 00:37:12.170
Glad it worked.

00:37:13.889 --> 00:37:14.952
If there's nothing else,

00:37:14.952 --> 00:37:15.850
I'll hang up.

00:37:15.850 --> 00:37:18.770
Jiatong, don't hang up.
I have something else to say.

00:37:19.250 --> 00:37:21.130
It's about the money
for my dad's surgery.

00:37:21.369 --> 00:37:22.409
I'm still short on cash.

00:37:22.810 --> 00:37:23.730
Give me more time.

00:37:23.850 --> 00:37:24.810
I'll find a way.

00:37:25.009 --> 00:37:26.409
Okay, take your time.

00:37:27.170 --> 00:37:29.650
By the way,
there's something I want to ask you.

00:37:32.136 --> 00:37:32.968
Go ahead.

00:37:33.850 --> 00:37:35.369
Back then, the project client

00:37:35.369 --> 00:37:36.850
hired a lawyer for you.

00:37:37.089 --> 00:37:37.929
It was a man, right?

00:37:38.089 --> 00:37:41.130
Yes. He kept visiting us
at the hospital frequently.

00:37:41.290 --> 00:37:42.290
A man, not very tall.

00:37:42.969 --> 00:37:44.049
His surname is Wang.

00:37:45.489 --> 00:37:46.250
But at that time,

00:37:46.250 --> 00:37:47.529
a woman also came often.

00:37:48.489 --> 00:37:50.969
Actually, when I went
to see you last time,

00:37:50.969 --> 00:37:51.610
I saw her there.

00:37:51.610 --> 00:37:52.569
You saw her?

00:37:53.130 --> 00:37:53.850
When?

00:37:54.210 --> 00:37:55.944
When I asked you to help with paperwork.

00:37:55.944 --> 00:37:56.854
In your firm's lobby.

00:38:03.449 --> 00:38:04.360
Wait a second.

00:38:07.048 --> 00:38:09.192
(Bai Xiao)

00:38:09.192 --> 00:38:11.048
(Xiaojie)

00:38:11.489 --> 00:38:13.049
Check the photo I sent you.

00:38:13.049 --> 00:38:13.730
Is that her?

00:38:14.650 --> 00:38:15.610
Yes, that's her.

00:38:42.248 --> 00:38:44.034

00:38:47.931 --> 00:38:50.280
(Lawyer: Shi Zhiming,
Manyida Law Firm, Beijing)

00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:52.642
(Lawyer: Bai Xiao,
Manyida Law Firm, Beijing)

00:38:59.089 --> 00:38:59.944
Ren Jiatong.

00:39:00.650 --> 00:39:01.480
Are you okay?

00:39:03.569 --> 00:39:04.089
I'm fine.

00:39:08.610 --> 00:39:09.969
It's my turn to write an article.

00:39:09.969 --> 00:39:11.369
Just stuck on ideas.

00:39:12.770 --> 00:39:13.650
There's another answer

00:39:13.650 --> 00:39:14.810
to the question you asked me.

00:39:15.048 --> 00:39:17.352
The lawyer might change a job
and couldn't take the case,

00:39:17.352 --> 00:39:19.330
so the lawyer has to
assign a new lawyer.

00:39:19.810 --> 00:39:21.529
All previous work is done
by this lawyer,

00:39:21.529 --> 00:39:22.290
but then,

00:39:22.290 --> 00:39:23.610
another lawyer's name is used.

00:39:23.770 --> 00:39:25.369
This situation is rare but possible.

00:39:29.610 --> 00:39:31.464
Mr. Zhou, I'm going
to get water. Thanks.

00:39:38.730 --> 00:39:40.584
Guo Xiaoyu told me you chose Mr. Song.

00:39:41.049 --> 00:39:42.728
I thought you were joking earlier.

00:39:42.728 --> 00:39:44.232
I never expected you'd skip Ms. Bai.

00:39:48.929 --> 00:39:49.608
Ren Jiatong.

00:39:53.690 --> 00:39:54.632
Want some coffee?

00:40:00.290 --> 00:40:02.210
If someone you deeply admire

00:40:02.610 --> 00:40:04.369
once did something that hurt you badly,

00:40:04.650 --> 00:40:05.969
causing you to lose everything,

00:40:06.210 --> 00:40:07.016
what would you do?

00:40:09.130 --> 00:40:10.216
Someone I deeply admire?

00:40:11.650 --> 00:40:13.896
I might

00:40:14.529 --> 00:40:15.752
instinctively avoid them?

00:40:16.049 --> 00:40:17.928
I'd fear and resent them.

00:40:17.928 --> 00:40:18.504
But...

00:40:19.650 --> 00:40:21.850
if they truly made me lose everything,

00:40:21.850 --> 00:40:23.112
I'd definitely take revenge.

00:40:24.009 --> 00:40:24.680
Then what?

00:40:27.529 --> 00:40:29.384
Actually, I'd want to ask why.

00:40:30.049 --> 00:40:30.969
Why would they do this?

00:40:30.969 --> 00:40:32.424
What reason drove them to do it?

00:40:32.650 --> 00:40:33.770
I know myself.

00:40:33.770 --> 00:40:36.130
I won't admire someone without reason.

00:40:36.130 --> 00:40:37.330
And the person I admire

00:40:37.330 --> 00:40:39.240
won't act without purpose either.

00:40:42.610 --> 00:40:44.520
But what if that person
completely ignores you?

00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:45.256
Or worse,

00:40:45.768 --> 00:40:47.976
you're so insignificant
that that person doesn't notice

00:40:47.976 --> 00:40:49.416
or care about your feelings?

00:40:49.770 --> 00:40:50.529
That powerful?

00:40:51.330 --> 00:40:52.049
Yes.

00:40:52.489 --> 00:40:53.889
Then become powerful yourself.

00:40:54.650 --> 00:40:55.529
Surpass them.

00:40:56.409 --> 00:40:57.929
Become undeniable

00:40:57.929 --> 00:40:59.009
so they can't ignore you.

00:41:08.610 --> 00:41:09.369
What is it?

00:41:15.690 --> 00:41:17.529
Come back if you're not determined.

00:41:19.369 --> 00:41:20.552
I want to join your team.

00:41:24.089 --> 00:41:26.850
Jiang Chen already talked to me.

00:41:26.850 --> 00:41:28.250
He does have potential.

00:41:28.650 --> 00:41:31.489
Ms. Bai, I know I've made mistakes.

00:41:32.409 --> 00:41:33.810
And you don't like me.

00:41:33.850 --> 00:41:34.449
But...

00:41:34.650 --> 00:41:35.850
I don't like you?

00:41:36.529 --> 00:41:37.250
Who said that?

00:41:39.330 --> 00:41:40.330
I feel it.

00:41:41.130 --> 00:41:42.409
As a law student,

00:41:42.489 --> 00:41:44.850
you analyze issues
without logic or reason

00:41:45.130 --> 00:41:46.009
but rely on instincts?

00:41:46.889 --> 00:41:48.409
If you truly want into my team,

00:41:48.730 --> 00:41:49.569
I suggest you

00:41:49.690 --> 00:41:52.130
drop this excessive emotional approach

00:41:52.130 --> 00:41:52.969
immediately.

00:41:53.369 --> 00:41:54.690
My feelings don't matter.

00:41:55.130 --> 00:41:56.489
Only your work results do.

00:41:56.929 --> 00:41:58.290
Seems you still haven't taken

00:41:58.290 --> 00:41:59.009
my words to heart.

00:41:59.889 --> 00:42:01.850
I only need someone
who gets things done.

00:42:06.770 --> 00:42:07.529
Go ahead.

00:42:07.770 --> 00:42:08.330
Why do you

00:42:08.690 --> 00:42:09.489
join my team?

00:42:15.929 --> 00:42:16.929
You're exceptional.

00:42:18.049 --> 00:42:18.730
I aspire

00:42:19.330 --> 00:42:20.770
to become as exceptional as you.

00:42:28.250 --> 00:42:28.850
Listen.

00:42:30.250 --> 00:42:31.330
You and Jiang Chen

00:42:31.489 --> 00:42:32.369
will compete fairly.

00:42:32.730 --> 00:42:34.130
I'll assign you a case study.

00:42:34.449 --> 00:42:36.170
Materials will be emailed shortly.

00:42:36.569 --> 00:42:37.929
The better doer gets the spot.

00:42:38.889 --> 00:42:39.432
Okay?

00:42:40.969 --> 00:42:41.889
I'll win.

00:42:53.730 --> 00:42:55.009
I just got Ms. Bai's email.

00:42:55.449 --> 00:42:56.089
Well,

00:42:56.610 --> 00:42:57.449
you are

00:42:57.449 --> 00:42:58.929
playing one-on-one with me.

00:43:00.850 --> 00:43:02.810
Sorry, but I have to beat you this time.

00:43:03.290 --> 00:43:04.409
I need Ms. Bai to choose me.

00:43:07.049 --> 00:43:07.752
Same here.

00:43:15.330 --> 00:43:16.834
(Why Celebrity Endorsements
Are Forbidden for Health Products?)

00:43:17.570 --> 00:43:19.360
(Answer: According to Article 18
of the Advertising Law,)

00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:21.890
(there are prohibited content
in health product advertisements,)

00:43:21.890 --> 00:43:25.400
(including using celebrity endorsers
for recommendations or testimonials.)

00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:27.388
(Hence, health products
remain off-limits to endorsements.)
