[Episode 16]

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:39.870
Pingyuan, what kind of business

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:41.200
is this shop going to be?

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.789
You're the head manager now.

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:43.440
You tell me.

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:44.560
I'll decide?

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:45.520
Well then...

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:48.789
[Ping]

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:50.850
I think we can sell boating supplies.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:52.610
Pingyuan,

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:53.789
the entrance to Huizhou Prefecture

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:54.789
is right by a dock.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:55.930
Most of the people

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.310
coming and going are boatmen.

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.039
If we sell boating supplies,

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:00.560
we could make a fortune.

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:03.310
Actually, that's not ideal.

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.790
There are already
too many boating suppliers.

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.950
Let's sell general merchandise instead.

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:08.680
Like premium items,

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:09.740
such as Jinhua Ham,

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:10.990
Osmanthus Duck,

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.170
wind-dried chicken, wind-dried fish,

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.770
and jerky.

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.630
But these items
are a bit difficult to store.

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:20.610
If you ask me,

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.470
you should put everything on the line

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:23.870
and open a grocery store.

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:27.160
Don't count on making money from the shop.

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.030
The main purpose is for you to learn

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.360
how to deal with people.

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.710
You need to learn to use your eyes

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.650
and your ears to make money.

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:36.960
Pingyuan, you're teasing me again.

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.290
How can ears make money?

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:39.320
Let me ask you,

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:40.400
what do you think

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.160
is the most important thing in business?

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.690
I've heard a saying before.

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:45.710
Have what others lack;
excel at what others have.

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:46.890
That's an old saying.

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:47.910
But how do you know

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:48.990
what others don't have?

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.890
How do you know

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:51.370
what others need the most?

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:54.560
Just now

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:55.480
on our way here,

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.470
there was a business opportunity.

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:58.630
You could earn

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.530
thousands of taels of silver.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:01.960
Thousands of taels?

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:03.050
Are you interested?

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.800
[Ping]

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:04.470
Pingyuan.

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:06.050
Even the Governor

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.720
can't earn that much.

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.310
Forget thousands of taels.

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:10.510
Even for 1,000 taels,

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.390
I'd kneel down and kowtow to you.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.020
Manager, Boss.

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:17.240
I didn't dare to buy you alcohol.

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:18.560
This fruit wine is very light.

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:19.680
Perfect for quenching your thirst.

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:20.280
Thank you.

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:21.320
Oh, right.

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:22.470
I need to trouble you two.

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:23.310
Please help me buy

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:24.570
1,000 chi of hemp rope.

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.200
About as thick as a finger will do.

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:26.400
[Ping]

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:27.840
And 100 meters of fishing line,

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.170
100 meters of silk ribbons for tying hair,

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:31.170
and 5 water vats.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.280
Then go to the stationery store

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.000
and buy some adhesive clay for making ink.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.760
Soak it

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:35.910
in the water vats.

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.890
Hurry and do it.

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:37.440
Alright.

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:38.210
Let's go.

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:40.840
What are you buying all these things for?

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:41.960
To make money, of course.

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:42.750
Make money? These things

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.480
don't make any sense together.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.470
Stop keeping me in suspense.

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:49.200
My brain is slow,

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.130
as you well know.

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.960
If you make me figure it out,

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:52.420
my head will explode soon.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:53.750
Soon, you'll use a chopper

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:55.050
to cut the 1,000-chi hemp rope

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:56.490
into sections of 4 chi each,

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:57.410
one by one,

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.150
and put them in the vats.

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:00.470
When they turn black,

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:01.200
take them out

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.050
and tie them with fishing line

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:04.240
before adding silk ribbons.

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:06.040
What do you think they look like?

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:07.610
Braided queues?

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:10.700
Over 1,000 chi of hemp rope

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:12.060
should be enough

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.000
to make more than 200 braided queues.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.920
We don't need to charge much.

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.519
Just 10 taels of silver each.

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:18.630
Just some hemp rope?

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.560
Would you buy it from me?

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:22.089
Of course, I don't want it.

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.870
The key is where you're going to sell it.

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:25.090
Hefei has just been

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:27.000
occupied by the Southern Army.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.190
Soldiers are coming

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:29.430
from all directions to surround them.

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:30.490
They can't escape.

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:32.130
They're finished.

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.440
If you sell them

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:36.390
near Hefei at this time,

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:37.370
I guarantee you

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:38.490
within 2 hours,

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:41.120
all the braided queues will be sold out.

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:43.950
Sell them to those people?

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:48.270
When they first entered Huizhou,

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:49.380
how many people were there?

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:50.110
Over 30,000.

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:51.270
And now?

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:53.720
They claim to have an army of 100,000.

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:54.720
So where did those

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.070
tens of thousands come from?

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:57.310
Just ruffians and scoundrels

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:58.270
who joined on their own.

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:58.950
They're not

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.480
truly committed to rebellion

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:01.470
or fighting.

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:03.680
Once the tide of war turns against them,

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:04.630
they'll be quick to flee

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:05.870
at the first opportunity.

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:07.670
But they have no braided queues.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.480
If they're caught
by the imperial court's army,

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.140
it's still a capital offense.

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:12.830
Hair is easy to shave off,

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:14.450
but not so easy to grow back.

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:16.160
Never mind 10 taels.

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.010
Even if you charge more,

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:20.040
they'll still have to buy them.

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:22.060
Really?

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:23.780
But I warn you.

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.310
This business can only be done once.

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:28.510
The second time will cost you your head.

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:32.600
Even once might be a close call.

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.440
Pingyuan, what about the tea plantation?

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.570
I didn't ask you to watch it all the time.

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:38.750

When it's time to harvest the tea,

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.900
you can go back.

00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:14.390
You've finally agreed

00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:15.450
to take me to Hefei?

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:19.500
Why do I feel

00:10:19.510 --> 00:10:21.640
I'm getting the short end of this deal?

00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:24.840
What can you promise me?

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:26.800
Why should I help you?

00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:32.860
Look at you, half dead.

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:33.790
I'm half dead

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:35.230
all thanks to you.

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:39.270
You took Yimei

00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:40.490
to Hefei, didn't you?

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:41.960
Yes.

00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:43.960
I personally escorted her

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:45.360
to the Prince's Mansion.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.270
Commanding General Li Cheng
has been promoted to Prince Cheng.

00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:50.070
She's now his Princess Consort.

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:52.480
You need to think carefully

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:53.800
how many heads you have

00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:55.970
to dare bother the Princess Consort?

00:10:57.390 --> 00:10:58.940
I'm not going to bother her.

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:01.960
I'm going to drag her back.

00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:04.780
Her father is my mentor.

00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:06.100
The old man now

00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:07.760
has barely half his life left.

00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:10.010
As fragile as a candle in the wind.

00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:10.920
What about her?

00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:13.010
She's out there having a good time

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:14.960
while others suffer for her.

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:29.440
How do you know she's enjoying herself?

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:31.850
I don't even dare to go home now.

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:33.870
When I see her father,

00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:35.400
I don't know how to explain.

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:40.140
I can't face my mother either.

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:41.320
Fine.

00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:42.960
I'll bring her back.

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:44.480
Can you guarantee
she won't run away again?

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:45.870
Or are you going to drive her to death

00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:47.930
just to make yourselves feel better?

00:11:58.430 --> 00:11:59.960
Those on the opposite side of the river

00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:01.690
think about different things.

00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:04.810
She has crossed the river.

00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:06.560
It's useless for you to linger.

00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:10.830
This is my last advice.

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:19.540
No matter what,

00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:23.030
I beg you

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:25.610
to take me to see her.

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:31.680
[Desheng Gate]

[Li]

00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:36.240
Ms. Su,

00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:37.630
His Highness instructed

00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:38.360
that recently, there have been many spies

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:39.750
who infiltrated Hefei.

00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:41.240
We must be cautious.

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:43.050
Need to check the goods.

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:43.720
Sure.

00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:49.120
[Li]

00:12:56.540 --> 00:12:57.100
These are all

00:12:57.100 --> 00:12:58.420
purchased for His Highness,

00:12:58.420 --> 00:12:59.890
for future use by the navy.

00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:01.750
I hired more than 10 porters.

00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:17.260
[Li]

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:23.380
It's a Qing Bandit!

00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:24.290
Qing Bandit! Qing Bandit! Qing Bandit!

00:13:24.290 --> 00:13:25.150
[Desheng Gate]

00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:26.000
Qing Bandit!

00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:27.510
Who are you?

00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:33.790
Who are you?

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:36.280
When I hired porters,

00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:37.890
I don't remember seeing you.

00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:41.400
Seize him!

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:42.790
No, wait! Wait!

00:13:48.290 --> 00:13:49.630
If I didn't keep this braided queue,

00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:50.460
who would carry

00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:51.990
these goods out of Huizhou?

00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:53.790
If I didn't have this braided queue,

00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:54.320
I would've been beheaded

00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:55.980
the moment I entered Huizhou.

00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:57.470
Ms. Su,

00:13:58.360 --> 00:13:59.370
I can leave today.

00:13:59.790 --> 00:14:00.960
From now on, I can't handle

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:02.600
His Highness's affairs anymore.

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:03.260
Wait.

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:05.380
It really doesn't trouble him.

00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:06.500
Ms. Su, this...

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:07.240
Enough.

00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:08.450
He's with us.

00:14:08.530 --> 00:14:09.230
Let him through.

00:14:09.230 --> 00:14:09.390
[Li]

00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:10.850
I was just joking earlier.

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:13.250
Alright.

00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:21.150
[Li]

[Desheng Gate]

00:14:30.490 --> 00:14:31.890
You almost got me killed.

00:14:33.630 --> 00:14:35.090
Who else would I mess with?

00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:45.230
[Desheng Gate]

00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:00.370
Are you okay now?

00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:04.400
Bro.

00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:05.150
Are you alright?

00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:05.670
Bro.

00:15:06.750 --> 00:15:08.750
How could I let anything happen to you?

00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:09.360
Let me see

00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:10.640
what's in your basket.

00:15:12.010 --> 00:15:13.120
Go keep watch.

00:15:25.390 --> 00:15:26.080
This...

00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:30.520
Listen, bro.

00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:32.550
Isn't this just hemp rope?

00:15:33.910 --> 00:15:35.060
Yes, it's hemp rope.

00:15:36.390 --> 00:15:37.270
Where do you expect me

00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:37.870
to get so much

00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:39.000
real human hair from?

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:39.860
Forget it then.

00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:40.740
No, no, no.

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:41.490
I want it.

00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:42.900
Hemp rope is fine.

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:46.300
But 10 taels of silver

00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:47.510
is too unfair.

00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:50.070
Let me be honest with you.

00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:51.950
If you weren't from my hometown,

00:15:51.950 --> 00:15:52.790
I wouldn't even sell it

00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:54.050
for 10 taels of silver.

00:15:54.390 --> 00:15:56.450
If the soldiers discover this stuff,

00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:57.870
I'll lose

00:15:57.910 --> 00:15:58.790
my livelihood.

00:16:00.030 --> 00:16:01.040
There are 1,000 in total.

00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:01.900
Ten taels each.

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:03.020
Take it or leave it.

00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:12.400
Don't even think about robbing me.

00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:15.010
T-These are just samples.

00:16:15.390 --> 00:16:17.390
I've left the 1,000 pieces in my cart

00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:19.570
which is parked on the official road.

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:22.740
I-If you have any bad intentions,

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.800
you'll only get these 10 pieces.

00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:28.800
Bro,

00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:30.440
what are you talking about?

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:31.080
Think about it.

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:32.140
We're buying these

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:33.650
to hide them away

00:16:33.690 --> 00:16:34.790
for the day

00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:36.410
we might need to escape.

00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:37.440
Here's what we'll do.

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:38.510
I'll send 2 men

00:16:38.630 --> 00:16:39.690
to go with you to get the cart.

00:16:39.690 --> 00:16:40.550
I'll pay you.

00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:43.130
But there's one thing.

00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:44.870
One thousand pieces aren't enough.

00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:45.960
I have an entire battalion.

00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:46.470
There are

00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:47.960
at least 2 or 3 thousand men.

00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:49.480
That's not enough to go around.

00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:50.740
You need to get me more.

00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:52.330
That's no problem at all.

00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:54.350
For business like this,

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:56.640
the more the better, of course.

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:01.840
Si.

00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:03.000
Uncle.

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:04.280
The banknotes...

00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:05.400
Hurry up now.

00:17:12.030 --> 00:17:13.000
It...

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:14.460
It really hurts my wallet.

00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:15.960
We work our butts off

00:17:16.030 --> 00:17:17.160
day and night,

00:17:17.829 --> 00:17:19.200
only to benefit you profiteers,

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:19.730
don't we?

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:46.000
Why are you looking at me?

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.260
I've brought you here.

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:49.350
Aren't you taking me inside?

00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:50.790
How can I get past all those guards?

00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:52.240
That's not my problem.

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:53.750
You only asked me

00:17:53.790 --> 00:17:54.920
to bring you to the Prince's Mansion.

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:55.590
You never said

00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:56.850
I had to get you inside.

00:17:57.960 --> 00:17:59.070
I have official business to attend to.

00:17:59.070 --> 00:18:00.070
Go in by yourself.

00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:15.450
I forgot to remind you earlier.

00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:17.980
If your braided queue falls out again

00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:20.400
and someone sees it,
they'll kill you on the spot.

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:22.400
It won't be my responsibility then.

00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:25.450
Let's go.

00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:52.550
Where exactly did you put the goods?

00:18:52.550 --> 00:18:53.750
Don't try any tricks.

00:18:55.970 --> 00:18:56.920
Just up ahead.

00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:29.270
Count them carefully.

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:30.510
There are 1,000 pieces in total.

00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:32.370
I won't make up for any shortages.

00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:34.640
Tell your commander

00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:36.040
I'll be back in a few days.

00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:41.870
Manager!

00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:42.860
Manager!

00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:44.360
Wait for me, Manager!

00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:45.600
Wait for me, Manager!

00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:56.280
-Manager!
-Manager!

00:19:56.310 --> 00:19:56.960

Manager! Wait for me!

00:19:59.070 --> 00:19:59.820
Manager!

00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:17.000
Is it true?

00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:18.640
Really?

00:20:22.890 --> 00:20:23.660

00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:25.290
-It's true!
-It's true!

00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:26.950
The real deal! The real deal!

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:30.070
How much did we cost

00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:24.340
would be a true injustice.

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:27.930
Come on. Come on.

00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:29.400
Let's sit down, the three of us,

00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:30.530
and have a good talk.

00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:32.130
Please, sit.

00:30:38.350 --> 00:30:40.240
During my patrol of the city today,

00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:42.100
someone startled your carriage.

00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:44.000
I knew it must be you, Gu.

00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:47.210
I put you in jail just to avoid suspicion.

00:30:48.070 --> 00:30:49.730
Sorry for the inconvenience.

00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:53.070
This drink is my apology.

00:31:00.270 --> 00:31:01.280
These days,

00:31:02.110 --> 00:31:03.400
the Princess Consort has often

00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:04.530
mentioned you to me.

00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:07.200
The kindness you've shown to Yimei—

00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:08.910
we

00:31:09.070 --> 00:31:11.240
can never repay in this lifetime.

00:31:16.070 --> 00:31:16.870
I understand.

00:31:17.350 --> 00:31:17.880
Good.

00:31:19.110 --> 00:31:20.640
Let's get down to business.

00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:22.140
What brings you here,

00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:23.220
Gu?

00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:27.890
I was

00:31:28.590 --> 00:31:30.000
sent by Mr. Bai.

00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:34.480
His life is hanging by a thread now.

00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:42.220
He wants to see her one last time.

00:31:46.110 --> 00:31:47.380
I hope you can go back.

00:31:48.030 --> 00:31:48.750
Go back?

00:31:51.540 --> 00:31:53.600
Who among you would accept her there?

00:31:54.030 --> 00:31:54.700
If Yimei can be safe

00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:55.810
after she returns,

00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:57.440
I'll take her back right now.

00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:00.030
Gu,

00:32:00.510 --> 00:32:01.480
you need to come up with

00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:03.010
a more practical solution.

00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:05.170
You have to go back, no matter what.

00:32:06.030 --> 00:32:07.490
This might be the last time

00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:09.330
you see your father.

00:32:15.070 --> 00:32:17.200
If necessary, we'll sneak in at night.

00:32:18.590 --> 00:32:19.160
Fine.

00:32:21.550 --> 00:32:22.880
I'll go back with Yimei.

00:32:23.310 --> 00:32:24.950
I'll pay my respects to the old man,

00:32:24.950 --> 00:32:26.480
so he can pass away in peace.

00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:28.680
That's absolutely impossible.

00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:30.080
You can't take this risk.

00:32:30.350 --> 00:32:31.070
You are a prince.

00:32:31.070 --> 00:32:32.400
To hell with that title.

00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:34.460
I am your husband now.

00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:35.640
Besides,

00:32:37.070 --> 00:32:38.350
I trust Gu.

00:32:40.590 --> 00:32:42.160
Even if something goes wrong,

00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:43.070
we, as husband and wife,

00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:44.400
will die together.

00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:48.980
Gu,

00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:50.570
I'll go get changed,

00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:52.380
and we'll leave immediately.

00:33:00.270 --> 00:33:02.000
Pingwen and 2 other assistants

00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:04.100
are still locked up in prison.

00:33:05.510 --> 00:33:06.710
Did they beat him?

00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:08.410
How come I didn't know that?

00:33:10.140 --> 00:33:10.790
Please find someone quickly

00:33:10.790 --> 00:33:11.780
to release them.

00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:13.940
I'll wait for you outside.

00:33:23.430 --> 00:33:25.380
[Desheng Gate]

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:38.590
Mr. Bai.

00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:43.160
I thought you were asleep.

00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:51.170
I haven't been able to sleep or eat
these past few days.

00:33:53.220 --> 00:33:55.540
I sit by the door, exhausted,

00:33:56.220 --> 00:33:58.430
but as soon as I lie down, I'm wide awake.

00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:01.630
Yesterday,

00:34:01.790 --> 00:34:04.070
I suddenly dreamed of Yimei's mother.

00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:08.020
I believe the time for our reunion

00:34:08.030 --> 00:34:09.389
is not far away.

00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:11.500
I just don't know

00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:14.960
how to tell her about our daughter.

00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:18.000
Mr. Bai,

00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:20.679
please don't hate Yimei.

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:22.550
She can be childish sometimes,

00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:22.960
but—

00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:24.420
She's not a child anymore.

00:34:25.190 --> 00:34:26.050
She's grown up.

00:34:28.150 --> 00:34:29.110
I don't hate her.

00:34:41.590 --> 00:34:42.630
Come in.

00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:15.020
Mr. Bai.

00:35:18.020 --> 00:35:19.420
This is General Li Cheng,

00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:21.340
Yimei's current husband.

00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:23.140
Don't be upset.

00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:25.140
Don't be upset.

00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:49.170
I'm not upset.

00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:53.130
Though we've never met before,

00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:56.320
I should still show some courtesy.

00:36:00.220 --> 00:36:01.410
Please rise.

00:36:04.610 --> 00:36:05.860
Father,

00:36:06.550 --> 00:36:08.680
please forgive my unfilial behavior.

00:36:10.030 --> 00:36:11.130
I truly and sincerely

00:36:11.130 --> 00:36:12.740
want to be with him.

00:36:14.770 --> 00:36:16.300
Please forgive me, Father.

00:36:22.230 --> 00:36:23.510
When you two got together,

00:36:23.510 --> 00:36:25.050
you never informed me.

00:36:25.190 --> 00:36:27.150
Why would you need my forgiveness?

00:36:28.690 --> 00:36:29.610
Father.

00:36:30.630 --> 00:36:32.330
I will take good care of Yimei.

00:36:32.710 --> 00:36:34.620
I will honor my vow for all my days.

00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:36.290
Should I defy this oath,

00:36:36.510 --> 00:36:38.970
let me be pierced through
by a hail of arrows.

00:36:39.670 --> 00:36:41.270
Father, please rest assured

00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:43.260
and take care of yourself.

00:36:53.630 --> 00:36:55.180
Please rise, General Li.

00:36:56.510 --> 00:36:58.510
I don't serve in the imperial court.

00:36:58.630 --> 00:37:00.340
We are not enemies.

00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:04.480
Both of you, please stand up.

00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:06.860
Thank you, Father.

00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:09.550
Mr. Bai.

00:37:10.110 --> 00:37:10.800
Rise.

00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:13.400
I'll keep watch in the courtyard

00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:15.060
to prevent any disturbances.

00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:17.510
Thank you.

00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:11.450
How is Mr. Bai doing?

00:38:12.020 --> 00:38:13.880
I just made him a fresh decoction.

00:38:14.190 --> 00:38:14.800
He drank it

00:38:15.110 --> 00:38:16.110
and went to sleep.

00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:28.250
What do you mean by this?

00:38:28.250 --> 00:38:28.730
Gu.

00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:32.890
It's easy to kill, but hard to save.

00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:34.090
It's easier for us

00:38:34.090 --> 00:38:35.550
to rush here day and night.

00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:38.160
But taking care of the elderly
day after day

00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:39.280
is harder for you.

00:38:42.690 --> 00:38:44.950
Please receive our kowtow in gratitude.

00:39:11.710 --> 00:39:12.250
Let's go.

00:39:40.940 --> 00:39:42.480
How can you not tell left from right?

00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:43.340
Manager.

00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:44.740
You're the one
who can't tell left from right.

00:39:44.740 --> 00:39:45.510
I am the manager.

00:39:45.510 --> 00:39:47.360
How could I not know left from right?

00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:47.910
Boss!

00:39:48.150 --> 00:39:48.840
Pingyuan!

00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:49.810
Pingyuan! Pingyuan! Pingyuan!

00:39:49.810 --> 00:39:51.320
Pingyuan! Pingyuan! Pingyuan!

00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:51.920
Think of a way

00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:53.200
to get us up there.

00:39:54.670 --> 00:39:56.150
Why should I get you up there?

00:39:56.150 --> 00:39:56.780
To go home?

00:39:57.040 --> 00:39:58.000
I'm injured like this.

00:39:58.000 --> 00:39:59.200
Where else would I go?

00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:01.670
Look at the state you're in.

00:40:01.670 --> 00:40:03.070
What would you do at home?

00:40:03.070 --> 00:40:04.070
Besides scaring our mother,

00:40:04.070 --> 00:40:05.070
what else can you do?

00:40:05.070 --> 00:40:05.860
Do we have wound medicine at home?

00:40:05.860 --> 00:40:07.260
Or a doctor for injuries?

00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:10.150
Go back and stay at the shop.

00:40:10.150 --> 00:40:11.610
Let me tell you something.

00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:13.450
Just move slowly like this.

00:40:14.230 --> 00:40:15.050
It's so damp.

00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:16.610
Don't lie on the ground.

00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:19.060
Once you lie down, you won't get up again.

00:40:19.230 --> 00:40:20.290
Words of wisdom.

00:40:20.550 --> 00:40:21.760
Don't take them lightly.

00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:24.390
But it's dozens of li down there.

00:40:24.760 --> 00:40:25.960
Then what do you want?

00:40:26.630 --> 00:40:28.760
Should I carry you up there? Is that it?

00:40:29.010 --> 00:40:30.350
Manager, Manager.

00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:31.510
Let's listen to Boss.

00:40:31.510 --> 00:40:32.510
Let's walk back.

00:40:32.630 --> 00:40:33.400
You...

00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:34.410
Go.

00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:36.820
Follow my command.

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:38.880
One, two, three.

00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:39.410
Left leg.

00:40:41.190 --> 00:40:42.720
One, two, three. Right leg.

00:40:44.190 --> 00:40:45.550
One, two, three. Left leg!

00:40:45.550 --> 00:40:47.310
You two jerks.

00:40:47.710 --> 00:40:49.240
One, two, three. Right leg!

00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:51.410
Left leg!

00:40:51.590 --> 00:40:52.380
Go!

00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:54.140
Why are you shouting so loudly?

00:40:54.170 --> 00:40:55.190
Right leg! Go!

00:40:57.800 --> 00:40:59.020
Why are you so clumsy?

00:40:59.050 --> 00:40:59.790
Get up now!

00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:03.630
I'll call out the slogan. I'll do it.

00:41:03.630 --> 00:41:04.560
Come on. Come on.

00:41:04.580 --> 00:41:05.620
One, two, three.

00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:06.670
Left leg.

00:41:07.030 --> 00:41:07.960
One, two, three.

00:41:08.120 --> 00:41:09.150
Right leg.

00:41:49.590 --> 00:41:50.730
Is Mr. Liao here?

00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:54.120
I'm Gu Pingyuan from Shanjian Village.

00:41:54.190 --> 00:41:55.230
Is Mr. Liao here?

00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:03.230
There's no Mr. Liao here.

00:42:03.230 --> 00:42:04.430
Don't be so annoying.

00:42:05.270 --> 00:42:05.920
Miss!

00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:07.960
Bai Shi'an in Shanjian Village,

00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:08.550
Mr. Bai,

00:42:08.670 --> 00:42:09.730
sent me to find him.

00:42:09.750 --> 00:42:12.080
[Miss Liao]

00:42:17.110 --> 00:42:19.400
Are you really not here to collect debts?

00:42:24.630 --> 00:42:25.150
Come in.

00:42:26.190 --> 00:42:26.760
Hurry up.

00:42:49.230 --> 00:42:50.700
Father, come out.

00:42:51.160 --> 00:42:52.620
