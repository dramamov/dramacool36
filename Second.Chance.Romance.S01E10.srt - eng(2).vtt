00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.690
Hello, Mr. Gao.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.570
Make a copy of last time's
financial reimbursement form

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:52.540
and bring it down to me.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.980
B1 floor. I need it urgently.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.130
Right now?

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:56.620
Yes. Immediately.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:58.930
Okay.

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:05.100
Master,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.930
Mr. Gao

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.570
wants me to bring a copy
of the reimbursement form down

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:09.730
to him now.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:11.380
Go ahead.

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:12.450
Make it quick.

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:26.260
Master,

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.610
could you come down with me?

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.060
I still have some work to finish.

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.780
Wei, is it a lot of stuff?

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.940
Not really.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.170
I'll head down then.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.780
Go ahead.

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:54.690
Hello, Mr. Gao.

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:56.010
I'm in the underground parking lot now.

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:57.450
Where are you?

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:01.410
Area A?

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:03.100
Okay. I'm coming.

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:51.730
Let me introduce.

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.100
This is Ms. Zhang,

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.850
the advertising planner
for the documentary

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:56.450
we discussed before.

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:57.100
Hello.

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.010
And this is...

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:59.890
Ms. Tan Siting,
I've heard so much about you.

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.500
Hello.

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:01.290
Let's sit.

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.850
Ms. Zhang is here at the school

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.540
mainly to discuss the details

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.690
of our upcoming

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:11.340
documentary shoot

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:12.220
with you.

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:12.850
Okay.

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:13.690
I've only ever seen Ms. Tan

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:14.850
on stage

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:17.020
or in competition videos before.

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:18.700
Today, I finally get to meet
the real person.

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.460
I'm your big fan.

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:21.290
Thank you.

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.810
I've loved ballet since I was a child.

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:25.900
But due to some twists of fate,

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.660
I never pursued the path

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:28.660
of professional ballet.

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:29.810
Being able to

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:30.850
film this promotional video

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:32.460
about ballet

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:33.140
and collaborate

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:34.980
with such a professional and renowned

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.980
ballet dancer like you

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.810
is a way for me
to fulfill my dream indirectly.

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:40.370
The honor is mine.

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:41.700
You like ballet too?

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:42.290
Yes.

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:43.850
And I've done some research.

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:44.850
There's actually

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:47.050
a great fondness for ballet nationwide.

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:49.930
Especially our investor this time,

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:51.700
who has spared no effort

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.900
in preserving, promoting,

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:55.850
and spreading ballet culture.

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:59.050
Actually, we struggled

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:00.100
to find an investor before.

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:01.540
Until this person appeared.

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:03.780
He really loves ballet.

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:06.020
It's our honor

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:07.340
to encounter an investor

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:08.460
so interested in ballet.

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:10.170
We've talked a lot.

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:10.930
Would you like to take a look

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:12.290
at some of our creative ideas?

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:15.250
Here's the thing.

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:18.980
Did you attend
Ms. Tan's class last week?

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:20.810
It was amazing.

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:22.700
Before, I always got stuck
on that grand jeté.

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:24.290
She didn't make me
practice it over and over

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:25.370
like Ms. Guan does.

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:26.580
She just played me a piece of music.

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:28.700
She told me
to open myself up to the music.

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:30.290
When I tried again, I did it.

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:31.490
Not just you.

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:33.140
Several people have told me
the same thing.

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.250
Makes me want to
sneak into her class too.

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:37.170
But honestly,

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:38.580
Ms. Guan is also really good.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:40.290
We learn solid fundamentals from her.

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.170
But it always feels like
something's missing.

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:47.410
Alright, everyone.

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:48.250
Class is starting.

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:51.850
Morning, Ms. Guan.

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:52.660
Morning, Ms. Guan.

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:56.610
Ms. Guan,

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.490
I'm well aware of your capabilities.

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:00.850
All the contributions

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.050
you've made to the school over the years

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:04.490
are firmly in my heart.

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:06.250
I know

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:07.780
you've endured a lot of grievances

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:10.020
since Tan Siting arrived.

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:12.660
The two of you

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:13.660
sometimes

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:15.980
have very different teaching approaches.

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:18.050
But there's one thing you share.

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:19.580
You both want to

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:21.460
bring up the best students.

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.980
If you have something on your mind,
just say it.

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:28.780
Don't keep it bottled up.

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:32.290
Ms. Zhuang,

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:35.580
the other day,

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:39.250
without consulting me,

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:41.410
you asked me in front of everyone

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:43.050
to let Ms. Tan take over Yufan.

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:45.930
I felt really uncomfortable about that.

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:48.660
I've been trying to

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:49.780
adjust my emotions

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.170
and state of mind during this time.

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:53.410
I believe

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:55.050
you had your reasons for doing that.

00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:57.250
And I firmly believe

00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:59.050
Ms. Tan definitely has the ability

00:06:59.070 --> 00:06:59.850
to guide Yufan well.

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:01.410
We all want what's best for the children

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:02.410
and for the school.

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:04.290
But later, I realized

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:06.960
that teaching students
and being able to dance yourself

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:07.850
are two different things.

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:09.810
Many of her methods

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:10.610
just don't work.

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:11.490
I'm really worried.

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:13.290
But

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:17.170
whenever something happens,

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:21.050
you always take her side.

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:23.020
Are you jealous?

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:24.660
Like a child.

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:27.540
It's good that you can

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:28.660
speak your mind.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:30.410
You've always been straightforward.

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:31.810
Say what's on your mind,

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:33.170
and you won't have

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:34.810
any lingering resentment.

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:35.850
Right?

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:38.700
I think

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:40.660
regarding teaching methods,

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:43.020
you could communicate more with Ms. Tan.

00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:44.250
I trained

00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:47.050
Ms. Tan myself.

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:49.050
I know her very well.

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:51.700
She's open to suggestions.

00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:53.540
You're both good kids.

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:03.780
Watch your step.

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:06.580
Good.

00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:08.410
Hand positions.

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:11.540
Head position.

00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:13.340
Very good.

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:17.340
Foot position is good.

00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:21.140
And down.

00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:26.540
Head position.

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:28.540
Ma'am, good afternoon.

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:29.170
Bye.

00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:30.050
Bye.

00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:30.810
Bye.

00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:32.010
Be safe on your way home.

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:33.180
- Bye.
- Bye.

00:08:35.670 --> 00:08:37.940
Class Two, line up in two rows!

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:38.890
Get in line.

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:44.300
Kids in the first row,

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:46.010
do you see your parents?

00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:47.770
Yes!

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:48.770
Go ahead.

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:50.010
Bye, Ma'am.

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:50.650
Bye!

00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:51.530
Bye, Ma'am.

00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:52.420
Bye, Yang Zihuan.

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:53.180
Kids in the second row,

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:54.530
do you see your parents?

00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:55.820
Yes!

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:56.490
Go ahead.

00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:06.180
Hello.

00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:07.530
Here, let me take that.

00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:08.060
Let me carry it.

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:08.420
Thank you, Grandma.

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:09.010
Come on.

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:09.890
Hurry.

00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:10.770
Get in.

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:16.180
Yes.

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:16.980
Get in the car.

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:17.980
Get in.

00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:42.650
Siting, I asked you out today

00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:44.940
to apologize to you.

00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:46.980
Oh, stop it.

00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:48.370
Listen,

00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:49.700
my parents

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:50.890
speak without thinking.

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:52.700
If anything they said

00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:55.420
was out of line,

00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:56.300
please don't take it to heart.

00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:57.610
I can understand.

00:09:58.100 --> 00:09:59.300
Ever since my mom left me

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:00.180
and my dad

00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:02.820
to find her own happiness
when I was nine,

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:04.060
my dad never looked for another partner.

00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:05.700
He was afraid I'd be mistreated.

00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:07.580
So I understood

00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:08.650
your parents' perspective

00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:09.700
over a decade ago.

00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:11.300
Hey,

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:12.890
why keep bringing up those sad memories?

00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:14.300
Look at this life now.

00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:14.890
How nice.

00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:16.180
Look at this life.

00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:17.340
Yes. This life.

00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:18.370
It's so good.

00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:19.530
Listen,

00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:21.490
you can't force feelings.

00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:24.130
Shuhan, if I really like him,

00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:25.490
no one can stop me.

00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:28.650
I heard from Yuan

00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:31.340
that you met Feng Rui again?

00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:34.490
I just did him a few small favors.

00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:37.460
You still can't let him go?

00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:40.100
I heard he's getting married soon.

00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:42.730
Don't go stirring things up
at a time like this.

00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:46.340
There are just some things
I want to figure out.

00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:47.730
Some things?

00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:49.940
What's left unclear between you two?

00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:56.010
My child might still be alive.

00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:02.530
I'm not sure yet.

00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:05.060
I need more time.

00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:09.460
Excuse me.

00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:12.220
Are you Ms. Tan Siting?

00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:12.700
Yes.

00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:15.250
It really is you. I wasn't mistaken.

00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:16.770
Hello, Ms. Tan.

00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:17.850
I study ballet too.

00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:20.100
I've watched
all your performances online.

00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:22.610
I've always wanted to be
a dancer like you.

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:24.650
My daughter's been a big fan of you.

00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:26.420
She reads about you every day.

00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:30.180
Could I please have your autograph

00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:31.300
and a photo?

00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:31.890
No problem.

00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:38.850
Thank you, Ms. Tan.

00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:39.650
Mom.

00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:40.650
Come on.

00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:42.300
Then take a picture with her.

00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:42.770
Okay.

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:50.530
Ms. Tan, could I later...

00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:51.530
Miss, could you please

00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:52.490
take a photo for us?

00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:54.130
Sure.

00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:54.420
No problem.

00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:54.890
Come on.

00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:55.890
Okay. Thank you.

00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:56.420
No problem.

00:11:57.100 --> 00:11:57.770
Stand properly.

00:11:57.980 --> 00:11:58.650
Mom, over here.

00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:01.300
Look over here.

00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:01.940
Ready.

00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:04.100
One, two, three.

00:12:04.670 --> 00:12:05.340
Let's take one more.

00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:06.250
Okay. Thank you.

00:12:06.270 --> 00:12:07.180
One, two,

00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:08.370
three.

00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:08.940
Alright.

00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:09.770
Here you go.

00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:10.700
Thank you, Ms. Tan.

00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:11.180
Thank you.

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:11.700
Thank you.

00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:12.300
No problem.

00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:12.650
- Thank you.
- Okay.

00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:15.060
Let's go.

00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:16.060
It's fine.

00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:16.530
Thank you.

00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:17.180
Thank you.

00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:20.220
You're quite famous.

00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:21.850
Still very popular
even after returning home.

00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:23.370
Happy now?

00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:24.250
Try this tea.

00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:25.770
Haven't had tea here in a long time.

00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:27.490
Didn't we come here often?

00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:28.250
We came here all the time before.

00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:28.890
Yeah.

00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:29.940
See?

00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:31.580
"We have our whole lives ahead of us."

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:32.890
"No need to rush."

00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:36.700
According to reports,

00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:37.820
Hongyuan County
in Aba Prefecture, Sichuan,

00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:40.100
experienced
sudden heavy rainfall last night.

00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:40.770
Feng Lexuan!

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:42.220
Hurry up. We're gonna be late.

00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:45.220
Large areas of the road
were covered with debris and mud.

00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:46.700
Due to the darkness and heavy rain,

00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:48.700
heavy machinery was deployed overnight.

00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:50.140
I'm not even awake yet.

00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:52.300
I really need to
get some proper sleep today.

00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:54.100
I definitely need to go to bed early.

00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:55.820
Isn't that what I tell you every day?

00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:57.060
We're running late.

00:12:57.060 --> 00:12:57.460
Well,

00:12:57.860 --> 00:12:59.340
eat breakfast on the way.

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:01.340
Using loaders and rescue equipment

00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:02.700
for clearance efforts.

00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:04.940
After several hours
of continuous work...

00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:05.820
Hello, Qi.

00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:07.060
The road has been reopened.

00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:08.100
Next,

00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:09.980
let's turn our attention
to financial news.

00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:12.300
Green development
is a distinct requirement

00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:12.700
for high-quality growth.

00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:13.300
I see.

00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:15.580
Wait for me at the winery.

00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:16.300
I'll be right back.

00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:18.940
Hurry up.

00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:20.540
I have something to do.

00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:21.580
Quick.

00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:23.260
Head outside.

00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:24.580
Put your shoes on. Quick.

00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:24.940
Hurry up.

00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:25.540
Faster.

00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:45.060
So, what's the situation?

00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:45.980
Last night,

00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:47.260
Hongyuan County

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:48.100
had heavy rainfall.

00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:48.700
Early this morning,

00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:49.940
the factory director, Mr. Ciren,
called me.

00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:51.540
Said the heavy rain caused a mudslide.

00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:53.860
Half the vineyards
in our factory area were destroyed,

00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:54.820
and the winery was damaged too.

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:56.060
Any casualties?

00:13:57.700 --> 00:13:59.940
I heard there were some minor injuries.

00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:03.820
How much wine do we have left
in the cellar ready to ship?

00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:05.220
None.

00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:08.460
How many of the vineyards can be saved?

00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:10.060
The manager is still assessing.

00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:11.420
Okay.

00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:13.020
Sir.

00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:15.300
Mr. Ciren says

00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:15.980
they should be able to save

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:17.620
five tons of raw material
from the vineyards.

00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:18.340
Five tons.

00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:19.540
That's good.

00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:21.180
Contact

00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:22.380
our regular suppliers.

00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:24.180
See how many grape raw materials

00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:25.700
that meet our standards
they have on hand.

00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:26.580
We'll take all of it.

00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:28.060
I've already called and asked.

00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:30.500
It's the grape ripening season now,

00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:32.420
so out of the five suppliers

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:34.540
we've worked with before,

00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:35.500
only two can supply us.

00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:36.700
If we combine them...

00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:37.100
How many?

00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:37.740
About six tons.

00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:38.380
Qi,

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:41.740
contact all the buyers
who purchased our wine.

00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:42.820
Tell them the situation,

00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:44.700
and that we'll issue full refunds.

00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:45.580
We'll also send them

00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:47.340
samples of our 2018 vintage

00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:47.860
as compensation.

00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:48.620
Understood.

00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:49.740
We've suffered...

00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:51.900
Call the equipment supplier

00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:52.900
to restore production capacity
as soon as possible.

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:53.620
Okay.

00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:54.060
Alright.

00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:54.860
Mr. Wang.

00:14:55.140 --> 00:14:55.460
I'm listening.

00:14:55.860 --> 00:14:56.740
Don't call me that.

00:14:57.060 --> 00:14:58.300
I've been waiting
for this wine for years.

00:14:58.540 --> 00:14:59.580
The clients have already paid.

00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:00.820
What am I supposed to do now?

00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:02.700
I... I understand.

00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:04.140
I understand this is a loss for you.

00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:06.180
But this is a natural disaster.

00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:07.500
We

00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:08.300
didn't expect it

00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:09.860
to cause such severe damage.

00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:13.220
Don't worry.

00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:15.820
We will issue you a full refund.

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:16.500
And...

00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:17.540
What good is your refund?

00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:19.580
These clients
are all long-term relationships.

00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:21.220
How am I supposed to
explain this to them?

00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:21.660
Qi.

00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:23.060
Book me the earliest flight.

00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:24.100
I need to go to the factory.

00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:24.780
Okay.

00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:27.020
And contact local relief organizations.

00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:30.140
Buy a batch of post-disaster
relief supplies.

00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:30.820
Make sure the quantity is sufficient.

00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:32.140
Have them delivered to the site fast.

00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:34.020
But with such huge losses,

00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:35.420
if we spend more money on supplies...

00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:36.220
These are two separate matters.

00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:37.860
You should have had
some measures in place.

00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:39.660
Like emergency safeguards
for the factory.

00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:40.980
Yes. You're absolutely right.

00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:42.620
We should have had
some emergency measures.

00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:44.100
But like I said,

00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:45.580
this was a natural disaster.

00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:47.420
No one expected such heavy rain.

00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:50.380
I'm really sorry.

00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:51.260
Alright.

00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:52.580
Okay.

00:15:54.900 --> 00:15:55.260
Ms. Li,

00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:56.340
I'm sorry.

00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:58.620
Maybe we could reach out
to individual vineyards?

00:15:58.980 --> 00:15:59.620
It's the only way

00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:01.620
to solve the immediate problem.

00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:04.380
The quality from individual vineyards
is inconsistent.

00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:05.420
There's no way to guarantee it.

00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:07.340
And the taste varies too much.

00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:09.060
Even if it solves our supply problem

00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:09.980
for now,

00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:11.180
in the long run,

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:12.820
it would hurt our brand too much.

00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:14.460
We absolutely can't do that.

00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:16.020
What if

00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:17.620
I have them send some samples over?

00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:18.980
If the quality is good,

00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:19.940
we could use some.

00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:21.660
That would take too long.
We can't afford to wait.

00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:24.420
Our grapes are special to begin with.

00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:26.180
Most grapes on the market

00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:28.100
are different from our variety.

00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:29.820
I'm aware of that.

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:30.940
Quality over quantity.

00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:32.820
Maybe

00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:35.540
Tianlu Trade has some channels.

00:16:37.020 --> 00:16:37.460
Sir,

00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:39.540
is a flight
in two and a half hours okay?

00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:42.180
Yes. That works.

00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:44.020
I'll leave things here
in your hands then.

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:44.540
Okay.

00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:45.180
Okay.

00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:07.180
Is that Mr. Ciren?

00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:09.220
Yes. That's him.

00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:24.660
Alright. I'll go talk to everyone.

Quiet.

Everyone!

00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:37.860

They're saying I have to
take responsibility.

00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:50.700
Okay.

00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:50.820
I'm leaving.

00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:56.540
How big is the shortfall
in raw materials?

00:22:57.620 --> 00:22:58.580
At least

00:22:59.060 --> 00:22:59.860
around twenty-five tons.

00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:03.780
Don't worry.

00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:04.860
Leave it to me.

00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:05.420
I'll figure something out.

00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:06.820
It's alright.

00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:08.420
Mr. Feng,

00:23:09.740 --> 00:23:10.700
we all know

00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:11.500
you're under the most pressure

00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:12.860
and feeling the worst

00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:14.060
about this disaster.

00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:15.940
You've been running around,

00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:17.140
working non-stop without rest.

00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:21.060
Actually, people are like
pressure cookers.

00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:22.380
Sometimes they need to
let off steam too.

00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:24.100
You've already done exceptionally well.

00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:24.820
Really.

00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:28.060
Good things never come easy.

00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:30.860
I can wait.

00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:32.660
I can wait for it

00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:33.540
to be released again.

00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:36.820
I believe in you.

00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:39.900
Definitely.

00:23:42.940 --> 00:23:43.300
I have something

00:23:43.580 --> 00:23:44.340
to give you later.

00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:45.380
Right away.

00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:01.660
The art education center you founded

00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:03.860
has really benefited all the kids here.

00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:05.500
They are very grateful

00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:06.740
and have written many thank-you letters.

00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:08.340
But they didn't know your address.

00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:09.500
So they entrusted you...

00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:10.500
They entrusted me

00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:12.220
to pass them on to you.

00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:13.540
The same.

00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:17.300
It's all their heartfelt thoughts.

00:24:19.380 --> 00:24:20.300
They wrote these themselves?

00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:20.780
Yes.

00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:21.460
So many.

00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:33.060
Impressive.

00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:35.220
Did they draw many of these themselves?

00:24:35.860 --> 00:24:37.260
They drew the pictures
and wrote the words themselves.

00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:37.740
Yes.

00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:39.220
They gained so many

00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:42.220
extracurricular experiences

00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:42.660
at the training center.

00:24:42.660 --> 00:24:43.180
Really.

00:24:44.780 --> 00:24:45.580
There really are a lot.

00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:46.700
Then

00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:49.900
please tell them
I received their letters.

00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:50.660
Okay.

00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:52.820
Hello, sir.

00:24:53.060 --> 00:24:55.420
First, thank you for helping us

00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:57.340
get access to beautiful things

00:24:57.340 --> 00:24:58.580
like music, dance,

00:24:58.860 --> 00:25:00.180
and ballet.

00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:02.100
Though I have never met you,

00:25:02.260 --> 00:25:03.420
deep down,

00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:05.100
we truly respect you.

00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:08.380
I imagine you are an elegant gentleman.

00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:09.420
From Qu Zhen.

00:25:20.940 --> 00:25:21.940
Very good.

00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:24.580
Head position. Hand positions.

00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:25.220
Good.

00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:38.820
Good.

00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:41.540
Hand positions.

00:25:48.540 --> 00:25:50.260
Your overall form

00:25:50.540 --> 00:25:52.780
and the lighting are both perfect.

00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:54.020
If we have a chance

00:25:54.020 --> 00:25:55.060
to do another take later,

00:25:55.060 --> 00:25:56.140
I'd like to see a bit more

00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:57.420
physical interaction
between the two of you.

00:25:57.580 --> 00:25:57.900
Okay.

00:25:57.900 --> 00:25:58.340
No problem.

00:25:58.820 --> 00:26:00.140
Let Yufan rest for a bit first.

00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:00.580
Alright.

00:26:00.580 --> 00:26:01.620
I'll go get some coffee too.

00:26:01.620 --> 00:26:01.940
Okay.

00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:03.340
You all take a break as well.

00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:03.580
Okay.

00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:06.460
That last take was good.

00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:07.660
But the lighting wasn't quite enough.

00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:09.580
I told you I want to dance ballet!

00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:10.820
Stop forcing me.

00:26:10.820 --> 00:26:12.340
I don't want to study acting!

00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:17.380
I just finished my ballet class.

00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:20.500
I'm begging you.

00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:25.380
Thank you for your understanding

00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:27.060
and acceptance of our delayed delivery.

00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:29.660
It won't exceed three months.

00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:33.260
Hello.

00:26:33.740 --> 00:26:35.020
Would you be willing to agree to

00:26:35.020 --> 00:26:35.940
postpone our order?

00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:36.860
I'm very sorry.

00:26:36.980 --> 00:26:37.820
This order

00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:39.420
has caused you such a significant loss.

00:26:40.180 --> 00:26:40.820
But rest assured.

00:26:41.620 --> 00:26:44.380
We will pay the penalty
as stated in the contract.

00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:46.420
I can understand your difficulties.

00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:48.060
Natural disaster, after all.

00:26:50.260 --> 00:26:51.860
Let's proceed
with your proposed solution.

00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:53.900
How did you like

00:26:54.340 --> 00:26:56.300
the sample of our new wine this year?

00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:01.180
Okay.

00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:02.980
Thank you for your trust.

00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:03.900
So, two tons, right?

00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:05.620
Okay. Thank you.

00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:07.420
We will send you the contract
once it's drafted.

00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:09.460
Thank you.

00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:10.740
Mr. Xu,

00:27:11.260 --> 00:27:12.340
I received your text.

00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:13.780
Thank you

00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:15.820
for being willing to accept
our delayed shipment.

00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:18.580
Yes.

00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:20.620
I'll treat you to a meal another day.

00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:23.140
Thank you.

00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:25.980
The taste of the sample
is still quite good.

00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:29.460
It's just that our order volume
is quite large.

00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:32.380
If delivery is delayed,

00:27:32.620 --> 00:27:34.900
we might lose many clients.

00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:37.780
Also, you sourced these grapes
from a new acquisition.

00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:39.380
We are concerned
about whether the quality

00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:40.660
meets the standard.

00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:41.300
How about this?

00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:43.700
Besides the compensation
stated in the contract,

00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:47.220
for your potential client losses,

00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:49.780
I'll add an extra fifteen percent
of the payment value

00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:50.740
as compensation.

00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:51.860
Excellent.

00:27:52.580 --> 00:27:54.020
Mr. Feng, you can supply me
with eight tons?

00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:55.100
That's enough.

00:27:55.740 --> 00:27:56.220
Look, how about this?

00:27:56.540 --> 00:27:57.500
I'll pay you five percent

00:27:57.500 --> 00:27:59.100
above the market price, alright?

00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:00.780
Don't stand on ceremony.

00:28:00.820 --> 00:28:01.660
Where are you now?

00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:02.460
I...

00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:03.580
I'll come find you.

00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:05.660
And we'll sign the contract.

00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:08.420
Okay. Wait for me.

00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:19.820
We've finished notifying
all the merchants

00:28:19.820 --> 00:28:21.060
who ordered the 2017 vintage.

00:28:21.980 --> 00:28:23.180
Are many people choosing a refund?

00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:26.540
Luckily, you decided to
give the samples away for free.

00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:27.860
After everyone tasted the wine,

00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:29.300
they gained a lot of confidence in us.

00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:30.580
So they chose not to request a refund

00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:33.220
and are willing to accept
our next released vintage.

00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:33.740
Okay.

00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:35.100
How many people
are not requesting refunds?

00:28:36.580 --> 00:28:37.580
About eighty percent.

00:28:39.100 --> 00:28:40.700
I contacted
several major wine merchants today.

00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:41.300
It was the same situation.

00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:43.700
But

00:28:44.060 --> 00:28:46.180
I've only managed to source eight tons
of raw material grapes.

00:28:46.340 --> 00:28:47.100
That's still far from enough.

00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:48.180
No problem.

00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:50.500
I can source around twenty tons here.

00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:54.300
You've all done very well.

00:28:56.100 --> 00:28:56.860
Go back and get some rest now.

00:28:57.660 --> 00:28:58.060
Great job.

00:28:58.300 --> 00:28:58.500
Okay.

00:28:58.660 --> 00:28:59.620
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you, sir.

00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:04.020
Sir, aren't you going back?

00:29:04.540 --> 00:29:05.020
Right away.

00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:06.300
Okay.

00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:12.140
You don't need to come tomorrow.

00:29:16.180 --> 00:29:17.460
I promised you both a four-day holiday.

00:29:17.620 --> 00:29:17.980
Have you forgotten?

00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:21.460
But we haven't finished...

00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:21.940
Yes.

00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:23.420
You've already handled things very well.

00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:25.460
Doing this is harder than selling wine.

00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:27.220
You've already done great.

00:29:27.420 --> 00:29:27.780
Keep it up.

00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:29.420
Thank you, sir.

00:29:29.540 --> 00:29:30.140
Thank you, sir.

00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:32.660
Sir, we appreciate your work.

00:29:33.020 --> 00:29:33.460
Your phone.

00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:43.740
I'm really sorry.

00:29:44.780 --> 00:29:47.060
Our problem has put you
in a difficult position.

00:29:47.340 --> 00:29:48.940
I know you want to

00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:51.300
promote our domestic wine.

00:29:51.780 --> 00:29:53.620
And that was my original intention
for entering this industry.

00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:56.460
Gaining recognition
in the overseas market

00:29:56.820 --> 00:29:58.060
is an encouragement

00:29:58.060 --> 00:30:00.780
for everyone in this industry
who shares the same intention.

00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:02.420
So,

00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:05.700
you two are the hardest for me to face.

00:30:06.260 --> 00:30:06.740
Sorry

00:30:07.180 --> 00:30:08.460
for informing you so late.

00:30:08.820 --> 00:30:10.060
When I saw you today,

00:30:10.580 --> 00:30:11.820
it reminded me

00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:14.180
of the story of your brand
that you told me.

00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:15.420
That's

00:30:15.820 --> 00:30:16.700
what moved me the most.

00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:18.500
Thank you for your trust.

00:30:18.860 --> 00:30:20.660
I know you urgently need this shipment.

00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:22.100
How about this?

00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:25.380
Let me recommend
another domestic wine brand to you.

00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:27.060
Their winery

00:30:27.340 --> 00:30:29.020
is from the same region as ours.

00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:30.780
I'm very familiar with them.

00:30:30.780 --> 00:30:33.220
The quality is guaranteed.

00:30:34.020 --> 00:30:35.340
I believe

00:30:35.860 --> 00:30:36.780
you will like them.

00:30:39.580 --> 00:30:40.180
Mr. Feng,

00:30:40.460 --> 00:30:42.820
what is the name of this wine brand?

00:30:45.020 --> 00:30:45.460
Mr. Feng,

00:30:46.580 --> 00:30:48.420
this is a great business opportunity.

00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:49.940
How did you think of me?

00:30:51.780 --> 00:30:53.900
Our wines come from the same region.

00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:55.020
Though

00:30:56.460 --> 00:30:57.820
the brewing techniques differ slightly,

00:30:58.100 --> 00:31:00.940
your wine,
in terms of taste and quality,

00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:03.660
is absolutely good enough
to be marketed internationally

00:31:03.660 --> 00:31:04.620
as high-quality national wines.

00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:07.820
I'm just very surprised.

00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:10.420
You could have sourced raw materials

00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:11.220
from other manufacturers.

00:31:11.980 --> 00:31:12.860
Such a good opportunity.

00:31:13.340 --> 00:31:14.500
Are you really giving it to me?

00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:16.020
Right now

00:31:16.340 --> 00:31:18.300
is the peak season
for all manufacturers to make wine.

00:31:18.860 --> 00:31:21.260
By the time I find the grapes
and finish brewing,

00:31:21.260 --> 00:31:22.420
the delivery time would long be overdue.

00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:24.780
Besides,

00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:27.940
I don't see it
as giving you the opportunity.

00:31:28.540 --> 00:31:29.180
On the contrary,

00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:31.420
you're helping me solve a problem.

00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:34.700
Mr. Wang,

00:31:35.420 --> 00:31:36.660
we both represent domestic wine.

00:31:38.060 --> 00:31:39.100
We can show the world

00:31:39.100 --> 00:31:41.540
that China can also produce
top-tier wine.

00:31:43.180 --> 00:31:43.700
Mr. Feng,

00:31:44.460 --> 00:31:45.380
I admire

00:31:46.580 --> 00:31:46.940
your vision.

00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:49.900
This mudslide

00:31:50.100 --> 00:31:51.740
caused you such significant losses.

00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:53.260
Yet you're giving
such a great opportunity

00:31:53.260 --> 00:31:54.140
to Huacan.

00:31:56.860 --> 00:31:57.700
Let me tell you something.

00:31:58.140 --> 00:31:58.820
You might not know.

00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:01.460
I bought

00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:02.660
a lot of

00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:04.300
Cygne 2017.

00:32:05.460 --> 00:32:07.380
It was mainly for comparative research.

00:32:08.420 --> 00:32:09.060
Well, this time,

00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:12.100
I'll give you all my inventory.

00:32:13.180 --> 00:32:13.740
It should be enough.

00:32:14.420 --> 00:32:15.940
You take Cygne's best wine.

00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:17.100
It will be fine.

00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:18.060
All of it for me?

00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:23.300
Thank you, Mr. Wang.

00:32:23.780 --> 00:32:24.380
I'll now

00:32:25.220 --> 00:32:26.100
contact the Finance Department

00:32:26.380 --> 00:32:28.340
to transfer you the payment
at 1.5 times the market price.

00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:29.700
Don't mention it.

00:32:30.660 --> 00:32:31.460
Like you just said.

00:32:32.060 --> 00:32:32.940
We both represent domestic wine.

00:32:33.540 --> 00:32:34.940
I must give my full support.

00:32:37.540 --> 00:32:38.020
Alright then.

00:32:40.820 --> 00:32:41.420
Let's do it at cost price.

00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:46.100
Thank you.

00:32:48.460 --> 00:32:48.820
Okay.

00:32:49.140 --> 00:32:50.540
Wrists. Pay attention to the rhythm.

00:32:50.740 --> 00:32:51.220
Very good.

00:33:03.980 --> 00:33:04.500
Good.

00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:04.980
And down.

00:33:04.980 --> 00:33:06.260
Prepare the second one. You two.

00:33:07.060 --> 00:33:07.940
Practice the piano well.

00:33:08.340 --> 00:33:09.380
Be serious this time.

00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:11.220
Thank you.

00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:11.620
No problem.

00:33:12.020 --> 00:33:12.260
Bye, Yang.

00:33:12.260 --> 00:33:12.860
Bye.

00:33:13.940 --> 00:33:14.500
Ms. Wu.

00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:16.060
Ms. Tan, long time no see.

00:33:16.260 --> 00:33:17.820
They said you took leave. You're back.

00:33:17.980 --> 00:33:19.420
I went to handle some family matters.

00:33:20.620 --> 00:33:22.180
Did Feng Lexuan come to class?

00:33:22.740 --> 00:33:24.460
He won't be coming to class anymore.

00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:25.620
Why?

00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:27.740
His grandmother called.

00:33:27.740 --> 00:33:29.460
Said he's starting middle school,
and the academic load is heavy.

00:33:29.940 --> 00:33:31.700
From now on, Ms. Wen
will teach him piano at home.

00:33:32.380 --> 00:33:33.940
His grandmother will come later
to handle the procedures.

00:33:35.820 --> 00:33:37.300
Did you need something from Feng Lexuan?

00:33:37.300 --> 00:33:37.700
No, nothing.

00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:38.660
Just asking.

00:33:39.380 --> 00:33:39.700
Bye.

00:33:39.700 --> 00:33:40.180
Thank you. Bye.

00:34:38.780 --> 00:34:41.540
[DNA Test Report]

00:34:54.820 --> 00:34:56.620
Back then, you had severe depression.

00:34:57.980 --> 00:34:59.660
You were unable to care for the child.

00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:02.980
And the child's condition was critical.

00:35:03.620 --> 00:35:05.820
No one could guarantee his survival.

00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:08.420
I could only have you sign
the power of attorney

00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:09.740
and transfer him to another hospital.

00:35:10.700 --> 00:35:11.780
But after the transfer,

00:35:12.060 --> 00:35:12.940
the hospital

00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:15.820
once thought he wouldn't survive.

00:35:17.620 --> 00:35:19.300
We had all given up hope.

00:35:24.020 --> 00:35:24.940
Every time

00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:28.420
I saw him, he was lying in an incubator

00:35:30.380 --> 00:35:32.300
with tubes all over his body,

00:35:33.620 --> 00:35:35.300
but he was still struggling to breathe.

00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:40.780
Miraculously,

00:35:42.180 --> 00:35:43.420
he survived.

00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:48.460
Later, we gave him a name

00:35:49.220 --> 00:35:50.660
with the character "Le".

00:35:52.220 --> 00:35:53.540
We hoped he could

00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:57.540
grow up safely and happily all his life.

00:35:58.540 --> 00:35:59.300
And he really did

00:36:00.220 --> 00:36:01.460
grow up happily.

00:36:04.580 --> 00:36:05.820
When he was three,

00:36:07.700 --> 00:36:09.740
he had a high fever
that lasted a very long time.

00:36:11.540 --> 00:36:12.300
Rui

00:36:13.420 --> 00:36:14.820
put all his work aside

00:36:15.740 --> 00:36:17.500
and took care of him wholeheartedly.

00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:20.980
After that,

00:36:22.900 --> 00:36:23.900
Rui decided to

00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:25.740
forget the past

00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:28.780
and start over.

00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:35.580
Although Le doesn't have a mother,

00:36:36.820 --> 00:36:38.060
what he lacks the least

00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:39.940
is love.

00:36:42.940 --> 00:36:44.100
Yan gave him

00:36:45.940 --> 00:36:47.660
the maternal love he was missing.

00:36:50.020 --> 00:36:51.020
She taught him piano

00:36:51.900 --> 00:36:53.300
and took care of his daily needs.

00:36:54.220 --> 00:36:55.100
For all these years,

00:36:55.940 --> 00:36:57.420
she's never stopped.

00:36:59.740 --> 00:37:01.380
You've probably already seen

00:37:01.980 --> 00:37:02.580
how Le

00:37:03.380 --> 00:37:04.460
acts towards Yan.

00:37:16.620 --> 00:37:17.620
I hope

00:37:19.580 --> 00:37:20.820
you think clearly

00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:24.700
about what consequences

00:37:26.580 --> 00:37:28.220
your next actions might bring.

00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:33.580
Why didn't you tell me

00:37:34.020 --> 00:37:34.900
that my child was still alive?

00:37:35.460 --> 00:37:37.380
Both you and he
were in such terrible condition.

00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:39.740
Do you think
he would have survived with you?

00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:42.700
What do you think I should have done?

00:37:43.020 --> 00:37:43.940
So that's why you lied to me

00:37:45.220 --> 00:37:46.580
and took my child away?

00:37:48.180 --> 00:37:49.460
Think whatever you want.

00:37:51.020 --> 00:37:52.060
Le has grown up.

00:37:53.140 --> 00:37:54.500
He has his own thoughts.

00:37:55.620 --> 00:37:56.700
None of us

00:37:57.620 --> 00:37:58.820
can predict the outcome.

00:38:01.220 --> 00:38:02.100
Does Feng Rui know?

00:38:07.740 --> 00:38:08.820
What difference does it make?

00:38:15.420 --> 00:38:16.180
This time,

00:38:17.620 --> 00:38:18.900
I will not give up my rights

00:38:20.060 --> 00:38:21.140
as a mother.

00:39:14.540 --> 00:39:14.940
Hello?

00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:22.100
Shuhan,

00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:25.060
can you keep this a secret
for me for now?

00:39:27.940 --> 00:39:28.260
Okay.

00:39:28.660 --> 00:39:29.140
I understand.

00:40:08.700 --> 00:40:10.020
How long are you going to
keep hiding things from me?

00:40:12.540 --> 00:40:14.220
Everything is piling up at once.

00:40:14.580 --> 00:40:16.060
I'm just overwhelmed, Feng Rui.

00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:18.780
What you need to do now is

00:40:19.140 --> 00:40:20.740
eat well, drink well, and sleep well.

00:40:21.860 --> 00:40:23.260
Leave everything else to me.

00:40:24.220 --> 00:40:25.140
I'll also find a way

00:40:25.380 --> 00:40:26.100
to handle the situation with your dad.

00:40:26.580 --> 00:40:26.860
Alright?

00:40:31.260 --> 00:40:33.260
I think this child has come too early.

00:40:33.780 --> 00:40:34.180
We...

00:40:34.180 --> 00:40:34.820
Let's get married.

00:40:44.980 --> 00:40:45.980
But I got accepted.

00:40:55.460 --> 00:40:55.780
Ting,

00:40:56.980 --> 00:40:58.620
if you want to dance, I support you.

00:40:58.740 --> 00:40:59.180
I was thinking

00:41:00.140 --> 00:41:00.700
maybe we could

00:41:00.700 --> 00:41:01.780
consider this

00:41:01.780 --> 00:41:02.860
after the baby is born.

00:41:03.380 --> 00:41:04.940
You're just brushing me off, Feng Rui!

00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:07.100
No. I'm just analyzing this rationally.

00:41:08.900 --> 00:41:10.540
This isn't rational analysis at all.

00:41:12.220 --> 00:41:13.100
You're not considering things

00:41:13.100 --> 00:41:14.380
from my perspective at all.

00:41:15.780 --> 00:41:16.860
I understand how you feel.

00:41:17.020 --> 00:41:17.580
But we need to

00:41:17.580 --> 00:41:18.860
handle things one at a time,

00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:19.260
don't we?

00:41:19.700 --> 00:41:21.140
What can we handle right now?

00:41:21.900 --> 00:41:22.580
This?

00:41:23.140 --> 00:41:24.220
Or this child?

00:41:24.900 --> 00:41:26.420
Or wait for my dad to come back

00:41:26.460 --> 00:41:27.820
and figure out
how to deal with your mom?

00:41:32.900 --> 00:41:33.260
I'm sorry.

00:41:36.740 --> 00:41:37.300
We...

00:41:38.220 --> 00:41:38.980
I won't think about all this anymore.

00:41:39.020 --> 00:41:39.300
Alright?

00:41:41.380 --> 00:41:42.260
I was impulsive just now.

00:41:42.260 --> 00:41:42.740
I'm sorry.

00:41:51.100 --> 00:41:51.940
I don't know

00:41:51.980 --> 00:41:53.780
why everything is piling up right now.

00:41:55.980 --> 00:41:56.540
I know.

00:41:57.780 --> 00:41:58.660
Let's not think about it, alright?

00:41:59.980 --> 00:42:00.300
Let's not think about it.

00:42:01.900 --> 00:42:02.380
I'm here for you.

00:42:05.260 --> 00:42:06.260
I was impulsive.

00:42:07.740 --> 00:42:08.820
Whatever you want to do,
I'll support you.

00:42:08.860 --> 00:42:09.260
Alright?

00:42:13.140 --> 00:42:13.660
Ms. Tan,

00:42:14.260 --> 00:42:15.180
given your situation,

00:42:15.300 --> 00:42:15.900
I believe

00:42:16.100 --> 00:42:17.900
you have full grounds
to sue for custody modification.

00:42:18.740 --> 00:42:19.660
For the past 12 years,

00:42:19.660 --> 00:42:21.100
you've been deprived
of your parental rights

00:42:21.100 --> 00:42:22.660
due to concealment.

00:42:23.540 --> 00:42:24.940
This is fundamentally different

00:42:24.980 --> 00:42:26.300
from voluntarily relinquishing them.

00:42:27.180 --> 00:42:28.660
And with your current
financial situation,

00:42:28.900 --> 00:42:30.540
you have sufficient means
to support the child.

00:42:32.260 --> 00:42:32.940
However...

00:42:34.460 --> 00:42:35.340
Please speak frankly.

00:42:37.020 --> 00:42:38.100
Children over eight years old

00:42:38.100 --> 00:42:39.740
are considered persons
with limited capacity for civil conduct

00:42:39.740 --> 00:42:40.900
under the Civil Code.

00:42:42.180 --> 00:42:43.900
When determining custody,

00:42:43.900 --> 00:42:45.780
the court will generally seek
the opinion of the child themselves.

00:42:47.220 --> 00:42:49.020
Your child is already twelve.

00:42:50.140 --> 00:42:51.540
During this time,

00:42:51.540 --> 00:42:52.620
he has been living with his father.

00:42:53.540 --> 00:42:55.180
So, subjectively speaking
in terms of emotions,

00:42:55.780 --> 00:42:57.740
he might lean more towards his father.

00:42:58.540 --> 00:42:59.300
In this regard,

00:42:59.500 --> 00:43:00.900
we can't guarantee
your chances of winning.

00:43:01.980 --> 00:43:03.980
Currently, your relationship
with the child...

00:43:07.780 --> 00:43:09.620
He doesn't know I'm his mother yet.

00:43:11.740 --> 00:43:12.500
I see.

00:43:13.020 --> 00:43:14.980
