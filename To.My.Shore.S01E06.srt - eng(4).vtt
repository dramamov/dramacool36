[To My Shore]

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:19.199
Director You, I had a great time
drinking today.

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:20.900
You sure can hold your liquor. I'm impressed.

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.939
You flatter me. Your alcohol is great.

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:25.179
I just got greedy and had a few more cups.

00:02:25.179 --> 00:02:26.459
You have an eye for good stuff.

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:30.980
This tiger-bone liquor was a gift
made by the former Police Commissioner.

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.099
It's been ages.

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:33.340
He doesn't offer it to just anyone.

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.000
I guess I was lucky.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.500
Director You, you haven't been here long,

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.659
but the local Hua community
thinks highly of you.

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:43.199
Director Zheng praises you all the time.

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:47.559
He says you're thoughtful, meticulous, and handsome.

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:49.939
He even wants to introduce his daughter to you

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:52.400
and make you his son-in-law.

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.700
Minister Chen, don't tease me.

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.040
I'll still be counting on
you and Director Zheng.

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.800
Your car's here, Minister.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:59.819
Okay.

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:01.060
Let's meet again.

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.939
I still have some treasures tucked away.

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:06.659
- You can try them next time.
- Deal.

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:08.220
- I'll be waiting.
- No problem.

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.459
Take care, Minister Chen.

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:11.239
Okay.

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:19.980
We'll head out, too. Young man, I've got my eye on you.

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.680
Director Zheng, rest early.

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:27.076
- Take care.
- We'll head out, too.

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.099
- It's chilly at night.
- What are you doing here?

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:38.819
Figured your dinner was ending.

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:40.376
I came to pick you up.

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:49.340
I reek of smoke and liquor.

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.559
What's there to smell?

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:53.580
You smell good.

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.819
So, the tiger-bone liquor went down easy, huh?

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:57.860
Couldn't stop at one?

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:01.879
How long were you here eavesdropping?

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:03.860
Do I need to eavesdrop?

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:07.076
That guy's voice carries a mile.

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.659
He used to be a military man.

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:11.439
He's used to barking orders.

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:14.860
No wonder he drinks tiger-bone liquor.

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:16.340
A dragon roars, a tiger howls.

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.540
Don't even mention that stuff.

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:20.699
They tossed in who knows
how many Chinese herbs.

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:23.900
The taste is... indescribable.

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.500
Yet, you still said it was good?

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.360
This is our first meeting, and he brought homemade alcohol.

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:30.940
It's the thought that counts.

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:32.699
I can't slap away his goodwill.

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:34.459
Funny.

00:04:34.459 --> 00:04:36.900
First time I handed you a cigarette,

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.240
I asked how it tasted.

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.459
You didn't spare my feelings.

00:04:41.459 --> 00:04:43.540
You said it was weird

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:47.660
and called it "Rouge."

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:49.100
Why?

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:52.579
- What's with the double standard?
- I don't know.

00:04:52.579 --> 00:04:55.699
I surprised myself when I said it.

00:04:55.699 --> 00:04:57.900
I don't usually behave like that.

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.540
It only means...

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:01.579
Yes?

00:05:01.579 --> 00:05:06.340
That means you're different from others.

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.060
You were different from the very start.

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.990
Well, what different acts would you like

00:05:12.015 --> 00:05:14.460
to engage in with someone different?

00:05:16.619 --> 00:05:18.459
Right now, I want to kiss you.

00:05:18.459 --> 00:05:21.820
Come on. Give me a kiss.

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:35.940
I've always kept life,

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:41.179
work, and love in control.

00:05:41.179 --> 00:05:44.380
I never gamble on what I can't win.

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:48.139
You're the exception.

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:50.440
Fan Xiao.

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:51.900
You're hard to read.

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:54.380
I don't even have you figured out yet

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:57.759
and I've already started
to let my feelings off the leash.

00:05:58.739 --> 00:06:01.019
I'm already starting to love you.

00:06:01.019 --> 00:06:03.459
You're a big gamble to me.

00:06:03.459 --> 00:06:05.520
Can I win?

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:11.700
Since when have you ever lost?

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:17.780
Fan Xiao.

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:19.820
Yes, I'm a few years older,

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:22.859
but I still want to hear sweet talk sometimes.

00:06:22.859 --> 00:06:25.459
Be nice.

00:06:25.459 --> 00:06:27.240
Say something pleasing.

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:29.020
Like...

00:06:30.699 --> 00:06:32.060
Am I handsome?

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:33.820
You're handsome.

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:38.600
You're the most charismatic, good-looking man I've ever seen.

00:06:39.419 --> 00:06:41.139
That's all I needed.

00:06:41.139 --> 00:06:42.800
Let's go home.

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:49.203
You kept saying you
wanted to paint me, didn't you?

00:06:49.203 --> 00:06:53.321
[Episode 6]

00:07:31.979 --> 00:07:35.119
Sit. Paint me seriously.

00:07:35.119 --> 00:07:37.240
Then stop staring at me.

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:39.711
I'll lose my grip on the pencil.

00:07:42.019 --> 00:07:45.440
At first I just thought your hands were pretty.

00:07:46.979 --> 00:07:50.660
I didn't know these hands could actually paint.

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:52.900
I never took classes,

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:55.900
but I've got some talent.

00:07:55.900 --> 00:08:00.360
Then show me my boyfriend's talent.

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:04.220
It might be in my genes.

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:06.380
My mom loved painting all her life.

00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:08.480
She was talented,

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:10.579
but she lacked opportunities.

00:08:10.579 --> 00:08:13.940
When she was young, she tutored kids.

00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:16.019
She taught them how to draw.

00:08:16.019 --> 00:08:18.720
My eldest brother was her student.

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:24.820
He always felt the art teacher he picked broke up his family.

00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:29.659
He thought she was the reason
his parents got a divorce.

00:08:29.659 --> 00:08:32.420
So, he hated my mom to the bone.

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:37.540
After my mother passed, my whole family left Bangkok.

00:08:38.359 --> 00:08:41.180
I was basically alone.

00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:43.199
He targeted me even more.

00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:45.819
He smashed my easels when I was a kid,

00:08:45.819 --> 00:08:47.599
and sabotaged my deals when I grew up.

00:08:47.599 --> 00:08:51.599
So you fled back here?

00:08:51.599 --> 00:08:53.619
"Fled"?

00:08:53.619 --> 00:08:55.980
My father approved my decision
to be independent.

00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:58.359
He sent me back with a lot of capital.

00:08:58.359 --> 00:09:01.780
My two brothers were green with jealousy.

00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:04.259
So far...

00:09:04.259 --> 00:09:06.840
I have the upper hand.

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:08.399
But...

00:09:11.059 --> 00:09:12.880
But what?

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:16.279
Relax and lean back, Director You.

00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:19.720
I need you stay at ease.

00:09:21.619 --> 00:09:24.719
But I could be toppled any time.

00:09:24.719 --> 00:09:27.659
That's my family.

00:09:27.659 --> 00:09:30.239
Eat or be eaten.

00:09:30.239 --> 00:09:31.699
Survival of the fittest.

00:09:31.699 --> 00:09:35.640
Toppled and eliminated.

00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:38.100
If that happens, then what?

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:40.220
I'll end up with nothing.

00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:46.780
You won't have nothing.

00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:48.880
You'll still have me.

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:53.320
If that day comes, I'll take care of you.

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:55.480
Director You.

00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:58.080
Do you mean that?

00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:59.819
Of course.

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:03.619
How about...

00:10:03.619 --> 00:10:04.860
you come over and seal it.

00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:07.860
Behave. I'm drawing.

00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:09.740
Lie back down.

00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:12.499
Undo two more shirt buttons.

00:10:18.019 --> 00:10:20.459
Pull up the trousers.

00:10:20.459 --> 00:10:22.659
Show a little of your ankles.

00:10:22.659 --> 00:10:26.180
These demands for your piece sound improper.

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:39.100
I thought it over.

00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:43.719
Getting a taste helps me draw better.

00:10:55.139 --> 00:10:59.340
I didn't know your office hid such secrets.

00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:01.540
You even have a little archive.

00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:04.680
How did I miss this before?

00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:06.259
These.

00:11:06.259 --> 00:11:07.619
And these.

00:11:07.619 --> 00:11:09.619
They're files I compiled.

00:11:09.619 --> 00:11:14.219
All historical data, but they're a good reference.

00:11:14.219 --> 00:11:18.580
You look dashing when you're focused on work.

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:38.440
President Fan! We're at work.

00:11:40.499 --> 00:11:42.900
Fan Xiao, this is the office.

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:45.700
Have I spoiled you too much...

00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:15.740
Come in.

00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:18.699
Director You, look at this
Vehicle Request Form.

00:12:18.699 --> 00:12:21.220
Both vice directors want
the top-tier business van.

00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:23.340
They both say their guests are important.

00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:25.819
How do I arrange this?

00:12:32.019 --> 00:12:34.619
Xiao Ding, come here for a second.

00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:38.259
Director.

00:12:39.579 --> 00:12:41.740
Xiao Ding, confirm whether Director Li's guests

00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:44.259
are the wife and daughter
of Qing Yu Pharma's chairman.

00:12:44.259 --> 00:12:47.499
If so, send the convertible.

00:12:47.499 --> 00:12:49.320
Have flowers and plush toys in the car.

00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:51.420
Chairman Shang Qing Yu's daughter is young.

00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:53.100
She'll like those.

00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:54.220
Got it, Director.

00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:57.780
Xiao Bai, the vice directors
request for the top-tier van

00:12:57.780 --> 00:13:00.420
to show respect for their guests.

00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:04.080
But this isn't the only way to show respect.

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:05.900
Use your head.

00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:07.900
If you can't even coordinate
something this simple

00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:09.579
and just execute instructions blindly,

00:13:09.579 --> 00:13:11.780
maybe General Office work isn't for you.

00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:14.499
I'll do better, Director.

00:13:14.499 --> 00:13:18.420
Also, get a set of PROTYOUTH's hottest serum.

00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:19.980
Make sure it's packaged nicely.

00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:21.740
Understood.

00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:24.259
- Go on.
- Yes, sir.

00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:37.220
You were so stern.

00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:39.680
I was scared in there.

00:13:41.379 --> 00:13:43.860
Then you should behave.

00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:46.200
Straighten your clothes.

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:49.220
You were trying to give me a hickey.

00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:51.579
I didn't dare disobey.

00:13:51.579 --> 00:13:55.020
Five work days a week and you've spent three camped out at Bohai.

00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:58.719
And in those three days, you spend most of your time in my office.

00:13:58.719 --> 00:14:01.340
People will think you're a corporate spy,

00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:05.640
stealing trade secrets
behind the guise of investment.

00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:18.199
Is the tea any good?

00:14:19.499 --> 00:14:21.299
Judge for yourself, President Fan.

00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:27.959
Serving tea to chase me out?

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.139
Look at you, so perceptive.

00:14:32.139 --> 00:14:36.840
So, when you said you weren't
fluent the Hua language and misspoke,

00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:39.099
it was just an act?

00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:46.479
I got better after watching
palace dramas with you.

00:14:46.479 --> 00:14:48.205
Sit back there.

00:14:52.919 --> 00:14:57.679
Since you're pouring tea, it's only fair I offer a gift.

00:14:57.679 --> 00:15:00.660
I'll make tom yum soup for you this weekend.

00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:03.120
- You'll make it?
- I'll make it.

00:15:05.699 --> 00:15:11.840
I'll also make curry crab, spicy beef salad, and pad Thai.

00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:14.579
You like old movies.

00:15:14.579 --> 00:15:17.319
I'll pick out some Thai classics.

00:15:18.499 --> 00:15:20.739
We'll eat and watch them.

00:15:22.267 --> 00:15:24.999
Sounds great.

00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:32.301
Then your weekend belongs to me.

00:15:36.499 --> 00:15:38.400
One second. I've got a call.

00:15:52.699 --> 00:15:54.240
Hello?

00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:00.883
What?

00:16:08.139 --> 00:16:09.780
Alright.

00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:11.457
Okay, got it.

00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:15.419
What is it?

00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:19.540
Something came up this weekend.

00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:21.330
I can't spend it with you.

00:16:31.699 --> 00:16:34.259
Xiao You, you're here.

00:16:34.259 --> 00:16:37.840
Why aren't you coming out? Where are you heading?

00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:41.499
Mr. Zhao, I spaced out.

00:16:41.499 --> 00:16:43.660
I didn't see the doors open.

00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:46.220
You're probably exhausted.

00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:48.660
You look pale.

00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:51.459
Working this Sunday?

00:16:51.459 --> 00:16:55.120
No. Just running an errand.

00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:57.780
Take care of your health, young man.

00:16:57.780 --> 00:16:59.950
Go on. Get some rest.

00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:16.100
By the way, I changed your door lock to fingerprint access.

00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:18.919
I tossed the old lock along with your ex's key.

00:17:18.919 --> 00:17:24.299
With your rich relationship history, who knows what weirdos still has keys.

00:18:02.739 --> 00:18:04.339
I'll do it.

00:18:06.739 --> 00:18:08.139
The oil splashed onto your hands.

00:18:08.139 --> 00:18:09.499
Are they okay?

00:18:09.499 --> 00:18:10.820
I'm fine.

00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:12.339
You're back early.

00:18:12.339 --> 00:18:14.559
I thought you'd take another 30 minutes.

00:18:15.739 --> 00:18:17.580
I missed you.

00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:21.019
So, I sped a little on the way home.

00:18:24.099 --> 00:18:26.580
I didn't think you could actually cook.

00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:28.060
I can't.

00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:30.679
I called the chef at home for tips.

00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:35.420
When I watched you swing that ladle,

00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:38.499
you looked especially...

00:18:38.499 --> 00:18:39.820
Especially what?

00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:41.180
Especially dumb?

00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:44.060
Especially... sexy.

00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:45.639
It's a waste to keep you in the kitchen.

00:18:45.639 --> 00:18:49.780
You belong in the bedroom.

00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:51.940
Sure. Director You's orders.

00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:53.219
Come on. To the bedroom.

00:18:53.219 --> 00:18:54.319
Quit it.

00:18:54.319 --> 00:18:55.939
We're staying at the dining table.

00:18:57.540 --> 00:19:00.000
You're pretty wild, aren't you?

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.359
The dining table works, too.

00:19:01.359 --> 00:19:03.619
Hey, Fan Xiao.

00:19:03.619 --> 00:19:04.900
Let's eat first.

00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:06.559
I'll eat you first.

00:19:06.559 --> 00:19:07.780
I'm genuinely hungry.

00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:10.580
Me, too.

00:19:10.580 --> 00:19:12.280
Fan Xiao!

00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:15.800
Okay, fine.

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:17.739
I'll simmer the sauce.

00:19:17.739 --> 00:19:19.340
Then we can eat.

00:19:28.379 --> 00:19:31.060
The tom yum soup is great.

00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:32.940
Of course.

00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:35.460
I've nearly worn out this cookbook.

00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:37.820
I spent two weekends experimenting.

00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:39.780
I even ruined a few pots.

00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:41.660
If you like it,

00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:43.880
I'll make you other dishes next time.

00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:50.060
Sorry.

00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:52.780
I promised to spend the whole weekend with you.

00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:54.019
I spoiled our plans.

00:19:54.019 --> 00:19:55.339
Not in the slightest bit.

00:19:55.339 --> 00:19:57.339
It's still Sunday.

00:19:57.339 --> 00:19:59.019
The weekend's not over yet.

00:19:59.019 --> 00:20:00.420
Yeah.

00:20:01.219 --> 00:20:04.460
I actually enjoy spending weekends like this.

00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:07.580
Just the two of us, spending time quietly.

00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:11.379
You and your ex never did quiet weekends?

00:20:11.379 --> 00:20:12.700
He's young.

00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:14.379
He likes crowds.

00:20:14.379 --> 00:20:16.739
We went to parties more.

00:20:16.739 --> 00:20:19.460
How's his cooking?

00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:21.559
Cooking?

00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:24.060
He barely set foot in the kitchen.

00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:26.524
Right. I remember.

00:20:26.524 --> 00:20:30.860
You told me you always cooked for him.

00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:38.400
Babe, stop being jealous.

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:40.300
It's too much for me.

00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:45.940
I hope no one interrupts tonight.

00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:49.800
This weekend belongs to us.

00:20:56.540 --> 00:21:03.280
Well, what do you want to do with me
on this beautiful weekend?

00:21:05.239 --> 00:21:06.933
You want that?

00:21:08.739 --> 00:21:11.228
Don't you?

00:21:11.228 --> 00:21:13.680
Can you give me what I want?

00:21:16.099 --> 00:21:18.820
I've given you the most precious thing I have.

00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:21.340
What more do you want?

00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:25.940
Hey, you already slept with
that You-something-Lang.

00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:27.700
What more do you want?

00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:29.019
What do I want?

00:21:29.019 --> 00:21:30.780
Life's boring.

00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:32.780
I'm using him to pass the time.

00:21:32.780 --> 00:21:35.040
When I'm done,

00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:36.919
I'll dump him.

00:21:50.279 --> 00:21:54.139
Don't you think you're pathetic?

00:21:54.139 --> 00:21:56.539
"You fall in love way too easily."

00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:02.739
Goal achieved.

00:22:02.739 --> 00:22:06.259
With someone like You Shu Lang who rarely trusts or leans on anyone,

00:22:06.259 --> 00:22:09.460
you're already pulling his strings.

00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:11.219
So, why...

00:22:11.219 --> 00:22:13.420
Fan Xiao.

00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:15.760
Why aren't you happy?

00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:46.940
It's chilly at night.

00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:49.175
Did I wake you?

00:22:55.900 --> 00:22:59.499
Every time I see your lone silhouette
at the balcony,

00:22:59.499 --> 00:23:03.250
I feel like you're not of this world.

00:23:04.019 --> 00:23:05.680
Like...

00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:08.599
you've come here for a trip

00:23:09.499 --> 00:23:11.519
and you'll fly back to heaven.

00:23:12.219 --> 00:23:13.980
Something on your mind?

00:23:18.019 --> 00:23:19.580
No.

00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:23.859
Go back to bed.

00:23:23.859 --> 00:23:26.339
I'll stay here for just a little longer.

00:23:26.339 --> 00:23:28.519
I'm your boyfriend.

00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:31.440
Why are you keeping secrets from me?

00:23:37.339 --> 00:23:38.580
Come on.

00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:40.103
Get back inside.

00:23:48.180 --> 00:23:50.660
I'm planning to sell the apartment

00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:52.990
and take a trip back home.

00:23:54.540 --> 00:23:57.019
What happened?

00:23:57.019 --> 00:24:00.580
My younger brother was the reason
for this weekend's disruption.

00:24:00.580 --> 00:24:04.019
He needs money back in Hua country.

00:24:04.019 --> 00:24:06.099
My savings aren't enough,

00:24:06.099 --> 00:24:08.979
so I'm going to sell the place.

00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:11.700
How much do you need?

00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:13.339
- I can...
- Fan Xiao.

00:24:13.339 --> 00:24:16.179
That's why I didn't want to tell you.

00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:19.480
I don't want you involved.

00:24:20.359 --> 00:24:26.199
But the agent's bringing buyers tomorrow,

00:24:26.199 --> 00:24:28.919
so I had to say something.

00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:31.139
Fan Xiao.

00:24:31.139 --> 00:24:33.800
Yes, we're lovers.

00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:36.603
But before that, we're independent people, too.

00:24:38.359 --> 00:24:42.219
This is still within what I can handle.

00:24:42.219 --> 00:24:44.320
If...

00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:47.920
I really can't handle it,

00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:49.860
I'll ask for help.

00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:56.186
I just set up all my dashing photos...

00:24:59.719 --> 00:25:01.859
Forget it.

00:25:01.859 --> 00:25:04.070
You've decided.

00:25:05.079 --> 00:25:07.439
I can't talk you out of it.

00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:11.047
Move to my place tomorrow.

00:25:11.739 --> 00:25:16.339
This dump can go.

00:25:16.339 --> 00:25:18.940
Buy a better one next time.

00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:20.639
But...

00:25:21.979 --> 00:25:25.259
I already applied for a company apartment.

00:25:25.259 --> 00:25:26.780
So...

00:25:26.780 --> 00:25:29.180
So what, Director You?

00:25:29.180 --> 00:25:30.780
Planning to dump me?

00:25:30.780 --> 00:25:32.019
I'm tired.

00:25:32.019 --> 00:25:33.460
Don't start.

00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:37.339
Let's put off the cohabiting talk.

00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:40.559
Let's sleep.

00:25:56.700 --> 00:25:58.499
"Younger brother."

00:25:58.499 --> 00:26:01.420
Why are there so many people
around You Shu Lang?

00:26:01.420 --> 00:26:04.160
When will I be the only one in his eyes?

00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:06.019
Me and only me!

00:26:08.757 --> 00:26:11.840
[Arrival Exit Terminal 3]

00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:48.900
Fan Xiao, my mentor heard I'm back and wants to meet.

00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:50.719
It's been a while.

00:26:50.719 --> 00:26:52.499
Well, you can...

00:26:52.499 --> 00:26:53.580
Go ahead.

00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:55.360
I'll handle some company matters first.

00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:56.719
Okay.

00:27:06.499 --> 00:27:08.540
Share your location.

00:27:25.339 --> 00:27:27.034
Zhang Chen?

00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:29.760
You're You Shu Lang's younger brother?

00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:30.859
That's me.

00:27:30.859 --> 00:27:32.520
You picked this spot.

00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:34.900
Planning to stand and talk?

00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:37.500
There are benches over there. Shall we sit?

00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:39.780
Bold of you.

00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:41.479
Posing as a grad student
from the University of Finance

00:27:41.479 --> 00:27:43.339
to coax seniors into investing their savings

00:27:43.339 --> 00:27:46.219
so you could skim commissions.

00:27:46.219 --> 00:27:49.820
But you're unlucky, huh. Global short-selling hit.

00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:53.700
You tried to buy the dip and got trapped.

00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:55.840
As per the contract, I'm just the trader.

00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:57.619
Losses are the investor's problem.

00:27:57.619 --> 00:27:59.519
It has nothing to do with me!

00:28:00.979 --> 00:28:03.580
That wouldn't be a big deal.

00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:06.180
Your mistake was greed.

00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:09.339
On top of commissions, you stuffed extra into your pocket.

00:28:09.339 --> 00:28:14.239
Way more than the numbers on the contract.

00:28:14.239 --> 00:28:16.157
Mind if I smoke?

00:28:20.379 --> 00:28:22.540
You thought the elderly would be easy marks.

00:28:22.540 --> 00:28:25.960
Didn't expect a tough one, and now he's got you by the throat.

00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:28.239
I'm not here for your gloating.

00:28:28.239 --> 00:28:31.979
On the phone you said you're You Shu Lang's friend and you could help.

00:28:31.979 --> 00:28:34.859
You call your brother by name like that?

00:28:34.859 --> 00:28:38.019
As far as I know, he covers your expenses.

00:28:38.019 --> 00:28:39.979
But aside from asking him for money this time,

00:28:39.979 --> 00:28:43.260
I don't see you keep in touch.

00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:50.859
I know what you are to him.

00:28:50.859 --> 00:28:52.360
If you want to score points with You Shu Lang,

00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:54.279
then do your job and help me.

00:28:54.279 --> 00:28:57.980
I'll tell him to sleep with you
a few more times.

00:28:59.060 --> 00:29:01.379
This is better than I expected.

00:29:01.379 --> 00:29:03.119
Guess the trip was worth it.

00:29:03.119 --> 00:29:05.820
Compensation plus principal.

00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:08.499
That's not a small sum.

00:29:08.499 --> 00:29:10.239
Thai apartments are cheap.

00:29:10.239 --> 00:29:13.660
Even if he sells his place, it won't cover it.

00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:16.820
The old lady's son won't wait for you
to scrape money together.

00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:21.299
Once he makes a scene, your degree and future are toast.

00:29:21.299 --> 00:29:23.900
- I...
- I've got money and connections.

00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:26.499
For me, this is easy.

00:29:26.499 --> 00:29:30.719
But I don't need you to win favor with him.

00:29:30.719 --> 00:29:33.559
If I want to sleep with him, I can.

00:29:33.559 --> 00:29:36.779
Then why call me out? Just to laugh at me?

00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:41.540
I don't want to pack up
those photos I just displayed.

00:29:41.540 --> 00:29:43.660
What?

00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:46.379
I'll pay the principal
and compensation for you.

00:29:46.379 --> 00:29:50.700
The old lady's son has agreed to drop it.

00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:53.060
My lawyer is drafting the settlement.

00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:57.019
You can sign the letter
of understanding tomorrow.

00:29:58.060 --> 00:29:59.499
But I have one condition.

00:29:59.499 --> 00:30:01.580
Bro, name it.

00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:03.360
I'll agree to anything.

00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:04.900
The condition is...

00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:06.560
Stay away from your brother.

00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:09.160
Stop running to him with every mess.

00:30:10.359 --> 00:30:13.940
I don't want to hang around him either.

00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:17.660
I only go to him because he owes me and my family.

00:30:17.660 --> 00:30:19.180
Debts he'll never pay off.

00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:20.420
What do you mean?

00:30:20.420 --> 00:30:22.580
Why don't you go ask him?

00:30:22.580 --> 00:30:23.619
Right.

00:30:23.619 --> 00:30:26.700
Like he'd ever bring it up himself.

00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:29.499
Zhang Chen, I'm paying a fortune here.

00:30:29.499 --> 00:30:31.480
You can at least share a little
of that ancient history.

00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:35.260
Since you want to hear it, fine.

00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:37.259
He's not my real brother.

00:30:37.259 --> 00:30:39.780
My mom picked him up from a trash dump.

00:30:39.780 --> 00:30:41.099
He was seven.

00:30:41.099 --> 00:30:45.119
Dead of winter, wearing a thin shirt, scavenging for scrap.

00:30:45.119 --> 00:30:47.699
My mom pitied him and brought him home.

00:31:01.979 --> 00:31:04.460
It was always just my mom and me.

00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:07.060
Then there was You Shu Lang.

00:31:07.060 --> 00:31:11.119
She glued cardboard, did housecleaning, anything.

00:31:11.119 --> 00:31:12.820
She did everything to put him through school,

00:31:12.820 --> 00:31:14.379
all the way to college.

00:31:14.379 --> 00:31:15.840
And him?

00:31:18.019 --> 00:31:20.340
He's gay.

00:31:21.940 --> 00:31:24.379
- What does that have to do with anything?
- Everything!

00:31:24.379 --> 00:31:27.460
In high school, someone outed him.

00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:29.339
The whole class ostracized him.

00:31:29.339 --> 00:31:31.819
Even thugs came after him.

00:31:32.619 --> 00:31:35.840
You Shu Lang fought back, hard.

00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:38.259
After a few close calls,
no one dared touch him.

00:31:38.259 --> 00:31:41.780
He cruised through high school and got into college,

00:31:41.780 --> 00:31:43.279
but he ruined me!

00:31:43.279 --> 00:31:46.159
When he graduated,
I'd just started high school.

00:31:46.159 --> 00:31:48.339
The punks couldn't touch him,

00:31:48.339 --> 00:31:50.940
so they bullied me instead.

00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:52.780
You know what those years were like?

00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:54.700
Trash on my desk every day.

00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:58.180
Soaked school uniform. Beaten in the bathroom by a crowd.

00:31:58.979 --> 00:32:00.780
They said since he was gay

00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:02.940
and I was his brother, I must be, too.

00:32:02.940 --> 00:32:04.820
I endured it all.

00:32:04.820 --> 00:32:06.700
He's my brother,

00:32:06.700 --> 00:32:09.659
the one I admired my whole life.

00:32:10.979 --> 00:32:13.499
But one day, they beat me again.

00:32:13.499 --> 00:32:15.620
Xiao Chen, home from school...

00:32:17.580 --> 00:32:20.980
What happened to your face? They hit you again?

00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:22.859
Take me to them. Take me.

00:32:22.859 --> 00:32:25.419
Don't, Mom. We can't take them.

00:32:25.419 --> 00:32:28.280
I'll go talk reason with them. How can they beat you like this?

00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:29.540
No reason needed.

00:32:29.540 --> 00:32:32.139
He's weak, so he deserves it.

00:32:32.139 --> 00:32:33.379
You're raising two losers.

00:32:33.379 --> 00:32:35.800
A coward and a faggot.

00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:38.639
Who knows what bastard sired them.

00:32:38.639 --> 00:32:40.079
What did you say!

00:32:40.079 --> 00:32:41.940
Stop!

00:32:41.940 --> 00:32:43.920
- Xiao Chen!
- Outta the way.

00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:45.619
Mom!

00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:51.460
Mom!

00:32:51.460 --> 00:32:53.320
Xiao Lang.

00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:56.259
Take care of yourself.

00:32:56.259 --> 00:32:59.660
Look after your brother for me.

00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:00.780
Mom.

00:33:00.780 --> 00:33:03.559
Mom! Mom!

00:33:03.559 --> 00:33:05.460
I'm sorry.

00:33:05.460 --> 00:33:08.180
But how is that your brother's fault?

00:33:08.180 --> 00:33:10.060
If he weren't fucking gay,

00:33:10.060 --> 00:33:11.899
this wouldn't have happened.

00:33:11.899 --> 00:33:14.259
If he hadn't fought back so hard,

00:33:14.259 --> 00:33:16.180
they wouldn't have held a grudge

00:33:16.180 --> 00:33:18.139
and hit me so viciously.

00:33:18.139 --> 00:33:19.760
My mom wouldn't have died!

00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:21.420
What the hell is wrong with your brain?

00:33:21.420 --> 00:33:24.239
You're weak and take it out
on the one who's strong?

00:33:24.239 --> 00:33:26.180
If he'd let them trample him,

00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:28.060
you think you'd have been spared?

00:33:28.060 --> 00:33:29.619
You don't get it.

00:33:29.619 --> 00:33:31.099
My mom saved his life.

00:33:31.099 --> 00:33:33.019
And he got my mom killed.

00:33:33.019 --> 00:33:35.700
He owes me. He owes our family.

00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:37.239
He can never pay these debts off!

00:33:37.239 --> 00:33:40.180
You know the truth.

00:33:40.180 --> 00:33:42.639
You're just playing dumb.

00:33:42.639 --> 00:33:45.139
You want to keep him guilty,

00:33:45.139 --> 00:33:47.719
so he'll be your workhorse for life.

00:33:50.180 --> 00:33:51.580
10 a.m. tomorrow.

00:33:51.580 --> 00:33:53.460
At Man Fu Lou. You're signing the agreement.

00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:57.140
I'll pay. But don't tell him you met me.

00:33:57.140 --> 00:33:59.700
Call your brother tonight.

00:33:59.700 --> 00:34:02.019
Say the other party's evidence is thin.

00:34:02.019 --> 00:34:04.739
You just need to return the extra you pocketed.

00:34:04.739 --> 00:34:07.859
Okay, got it.

00:34:07.859 --> 00:34:09.680
Hands up.

00:34:11.900 --> 00:34:13.559
Higher.

00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:31.639
Sorry. No trash cans nearby.

00:34:32.660 --> 00:34:35.600
Keep the city clean. It's everyone's responsibility.

00:34:53.339 --> 00:34:58.100
Shu Lang. You said you'd introduce me to someone.

00:34:58.100 --> 00:34:59.900
Yeah.

00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:01.759
Where are we?

00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:04.400
Here, take it.

00:35:15.379 --> 00:35:17.700
It's fine. I'm not that cold.

00:35:17.700 --> 00:35:19.279
Keep it on.

00:35:25.479 --> 00:35:27.160
Wait up.

00:35:30.418 --> 00:35:33.665
[Grave of Late Mother Luo Qin Qin]

00:35:48.339 --> 00:35:51.639
Mom. Miss me?

00:35:52.779 --> 00:35:54.760
I'm sorry.

00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:56.539
Last year, I was too busy.

00:35:56.539 --> 00:35:59.180
I didn't make it back on your memorial day.

00:36:00.539 --> 00:36:02.339
Right, Mom.

00:36:02.339 --> 00:36:06.680
You always said if I found someone I liked,

00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:08.139
be it man or woman,

00:36:08.139 --> 00:36:10.720
I should bring them to see you.

00:36:11.619 --> 00:36:13.700
I brought him here.

00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:16.459
He's handsome, right?

00:36:17.099 --> 00:36:19.060
And he treats me well.

00:36:19.859 --> 00:36:21.480
Mom.

00:36:22.579 --> 00:36:28.300
You always said there'd be someone who'd appear

00:36:29.539 --> 00:36:32.520
and make me think this world isn't so bad.

00:36:34.900 --> 00:36:36.400
I think...

00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:43.461
I found him.

00:37:01.619 --> 00:37:03.619
Fan Xiao.

00:37:03.619 --> 00:37:05.731
Why are you zoning out?

00:37:06.980 --> 00:37:08.779
It's nothing.

00:37:08.779 --> 00:37:13.159
I was thinking about what to say to your mom.

00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:18.000
Ma'am, we'll visit often.

00:37:19.059 --> 00:37:22.140
I'll take care of Shu Lang.

00:37:23.180 --> 00:37:25.279
Why so nervous?

00:37:25.279 --> 00:37:27.799
I'm not nervous.

00:37:27.799 --> 00:37:30.059
There's no need to be solemn.

00:37:30.059 --> 00:37:32.819
I used to sit here and tell her jokes.

00:37:32.819 --> 00:37:35.740
She loved the tall tales from that radio show.

00:37:35.740 --> 00:37:38.420
It's my first time meeting your mom.

00:37:38.420 --> 00:37:40.480
I should be proper.

00:37:43.519 --> 00:37:45.059
Fan Xiao.

00:37:45.059 --> 00:37:47.139
You're freezing.

00:37:47.139 --> 00:37:49.720
Your hands are like ice.

00:37:50.779 --> 00:37:53.639
The mountain's a bit cold.

00:37:54.379 --> 00:37:57.020
I told you to wear a puffer this morning.

00:37:57.020 --> 00:37:58.500
You wanted to look sharp in that overcoat.

00:37:58.500 --> 00:37:59.900
This isn't Thailand.

00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:01.940
It's freezing in the morning.

00:38:01.940 --> 00:38:04.300
Come on. Let's head down.

00:38:12.260 --> 00:38:13.900
Did your ex ever come here?

00:38:13.900 --> 00:38:15.339
What?

00:38:15.339 --> 00:38:17.460
To pay respects to your adoptive mom.

00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:18.660
No.

00:38:18.660 --> 00:38:20.420
He never did.

00:38:20.420 --> 00:38:22.020
Really? You're not lying?

00:38:22.020 --> 00:38:25.120
Really. I'm not lying.

00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:26.379
Why not?

00:38:26.379 --> 00:38:29.339
It felt like you two were together a while.

00:38:29.339 --> 00:38:30.660
He's young.

00:38:30.660 --> 00:38:32.339
He hasn't seen much.

00:38:32.339 --> 00:38:34.379
He doesn't understand a lot of things.

00:38:34.379 --> 00:38:37.539
He didn't know my past either.

00:38:37.539 --> 00:38:39.579
So, you think I'm old.

00:38:39.579 --> 00:38:42.079
So, there's no need to shield
an innocent heart.

00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:49.139
Honestly...

00:38:49.139 --> 00:38:54.460
With my ex, I felt like I was coaxing a kid.

00:38:54.460 --> 00:38:57.020
Beyond daily life,

00:38:57.020 --> 00:38:59.700
we rarely connected on a deeper level.

00:38:59.700 --> 00:39:02.539
I thought loving him meant looking after him.

00:39:02.539 --> 00:39:07.059
I did what I could to give him comfort.

00:39:07.059 --> 00:39:09.740
He asked to break up suddenly.

00:39:09.740 --> 00:39:11.260
I didn't pry.

00:39:11.260 --> 00:39:13.148
I didn't want to embarrass him.

00:39:13.779 --> 00:39:16.740
Truth is, his heart had drifted.

00:39:16.740 --> 00:39:19.199
He was no longer looking at me.

00:39:19.199 --> 00:39:23.078
I can guess the rest.

00:39:23.779 --> 00:39:26.779
I looked cool on the surface,

00:39:26.779 --> 00:39:30.020
but I did blame him a little.

00:39:30.020 --> 00:39:32.562
Until he said...

00:39:33.900 --> 00:39:37.059
I was always cold to him.

00:39:37.059 --> 00:39:40.099
My heart was locked tight,

00:39:40.099 --> 00:39:42.884
and he couldn't get into my world.

00:39:43.900 --> 00:39:47.660
It made him anxious.

00:39:47.660 --> 00:39:49.539
That was when I realized

00:39:49.539 --> 00:39:53.500
I never thought about
letting him see all of me.

00:39:53.500 --> 00:39:58.099
I also didn't want to know
what he really felt either.

00:39:58.099 --> 00:40:01.023
Maybe I didn't love him that much.

00:40:11.740 --> 00:40:13.260
What about me?

00:40:13.260 --> 00:40:14.804
You?

00:40:16.099 --> 00:40:18.460
I don't know.

00:40:18.460 --> 00:40:22.639
I used to analyze pros and cons before doing anything.

00:40:22.639 --> 00:40:26.699
Even starting a relationship.

00:40:27.619 --> 00:40:29.724
With you,

00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:33.539
I've done all kinds of foolish things.

00:40:33.539 --> 00:40:36.871
And I'll own every foolish tab.

00:40:42.619 --> 00:40:44.859
Your ears are red.

00:40:44.859 --> 00:40:47.099
Let's get in the car.

00:40:47.099 --> 00:40:48.710
Let's go.

00:40:57.260 --> 00:40:59.432
It's warmer in here.

00:41:03.579 --> 00:41:05.180
What's this?

00:41:05.180 --> 00:41:06.460
A promissory note?

00:41:06.460 --> 00:41:08.619
The money you paid for my brother.

00:41:08.619 --> 00:41:09.900
I owe you.

00:41:09.900 --> 00:41:12.260
- How did you...
- Thanks.

00:41:16.020 --> 00:41:18.579
I talked to those people twice.

00:41:18.579 --> 00:41:20.460
They weren't reasonable.

00:41:20.460 --> 00:41:22.660
When my brother said it was resolved,

00:41:22.660 --> 00:41:25.420
I knew you stepped in.

00:41:25.420 --> 00:41:27.020
I checked.

00:41:27.020 --> 00:41:29.060
Just as I thought.

00:41:30.239 --> 00:41:34.579
I told you not to get involved because there could be legal risks.

00:41:34.579 --> 00:41:39.200
But you went all in behind my back.

00:41:41.740 --> 00:41:43.940
If money can fix it,

00:41:43.940 --> 00:41:46.020
it's not a problem.

00:41:46.020 --> 00:41:47.260
Don't worry.

00:41:47.260 --> 00:41:49.232
There are no risks.

00:41:49.900 --> 00:41:53.379
More importantly, I just changed
your house lock.

00:41:53.379 --> 00:41:57.239
The curtains and bed were pricey.

00:41:57.239 --> 00:41:59.779
It'd be a waste to lose them.

00:41:59.779 --> 00:42:03.819
And my dashing photos.

00:42:03.819 --> 00:42:07.740
I spent ages finding the perfect angles

00:42:07.740 --> 00:42:13.739
so you can see me from every room in your home.

00:42:18.619 --> 00:42:20.819
I'm almost 30 now.

00:42:20.819 --> 00:42:23.139
I've always been the one shielding others.

00:42:23.139 --> 00:42:27.020
I never thought someone
would be my shield.

00:42:27.020 --> 00:42:29.420
Now...

00:42:29.420 --> 00:42:32.819
I can be the weak one, too.

00:42:32.819 --> 00:42:35.379
Being taken care of by my boyfriend
feels pretty good.

00:42:35.379 --> 00:42:38.640
Fan Xiao, thanks.

00:42:40.420 --> 00:42:44.740
But if you dare dismiss my opinions again,

00:42:44.740 --> 00:42:47.460
I won't let it slide.

00:42:57.260 --> 00:43:00.820
Yes, my Director You.

00:43:02.740 --> 00:43:04.339
Shu Lang.

00:43:04.339 --> 00:43:06.339
So...

00:43:06.339 --> 00:43:12.580
If your ex and I both fell into a lake, who would you save?

00:43:12.580 --> 00:43:16.619
Have you been binging costume dramas or family melodramas after dating me?

00:43:16.619 --> 00:43:19.560
Save who? Neither.

00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:21.700
I'll let you drown.
