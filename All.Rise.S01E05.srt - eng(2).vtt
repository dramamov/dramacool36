(Talent Hunt Program Day 11)

00:01:49.992 --> 00:01:52.104
(Li Ke 5, Yan Fei 5,
Huang Yue 4, Wang Lu 3)

00:01:52.104 --> 00:01:53.832
(Guo Xiaoyu 2,
Ren Jiatong 1, Jiang Chen 1)

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:56.181
Okay.

00:01:57.021 --> 00:01:59.141
You're all so noble and righteous.

00:01:59.861 --> 00:02:00.941
I'm the villain here.

00:02:01.941 --> 00:02:03.221
I know you're not poor.

00:02:03.581 --> 00:02:04.540
But I am.

00:02:09.141 --> 00:02:10.021
I blame no one.

00:02:10.021 --> 00:02:11.660
Maybe this is just my problem.

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.460
I'm just not cut out for Jun An.

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.261
Li Ke, don't worry.

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.981
Next week,

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.541
I'm applying to leave
the Talent Hunt Program

00:02:23.981 --> 00:02:24.940
and go back to Hangzhou.

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:31.413
It's...

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.021
It's not that serious, Xiaoyu.

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:38.261
I'm exhausted.

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.701
I can't keep up.

00:02:42.541 --> 00:02:43.541
Since you're leaving,

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.141
why not get a clear answer?

00:02:45.581 --> 00:02:46.940
Isn't it better to know the truth?

00:02:47.541 --> 00:02:48.500
You're a lawyer.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.301
Quit all the whining and complaining.

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.861
Getting scared over little things.

00:02:52.301 --> 00:02:53.141
Be bold and ask her.

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:54.581
Did she actually see it?

00:02:54.701 --> 00:02:55.460
How did she do it?

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.060
Any explanation?

00:03:00.581 --> 00:03:01.421
Are you free later?

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.421
Clear some time.

00:03:03.861 --> 00:03:05.500
Xiaoyu wants to talk at the noodle shop.

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:07.660
I asked Ren Jiatong to go

00:03:08.021 --> 00:03:09.141
to the noodle shop later.

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:12.940
It's fine. Take time to think.

00:03:13.021 --> 00:03:14.180
You don't have to go.

00:03:14.261 --> 00:03:15.581
But if you want the truth,

00:03:16.101 --> 00:03:17.021
go to the noodle shop.

00:03:21.203 --> 00:03:21.821
(Noodles)

00:03:21.821 --> 00:03:23.060
Jiang Chen filled me in.

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.421
First, I didn't.

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.180
Honestly, I don't have to

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:29.740
explain something I didn't do.

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:31.421
But Jiang Chen told me

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.381
you're upset and want
to return to Hangzhou.

00:03:33.981 --> 00:03:35.940
So I felt I should tell you.

00:03:36.301 --> 00:03:38.460
If you're leaving because you lost,

00:03:38.701 --> 00:03:39.740
then just go back.

00:03:40.141 --> 00:03:41.861
But if it's because you
think I copied you,

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:43.581
I suggest you stay.

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:45.981
Gather evidence to defend yourself.

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.220
Am I being petty?

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.180
These noodles are amazing.

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:58.460
Want to eat first
before self-reflection?

00:04:00.701 --> 00:04:02.701
No appetite.

00:04:04.301 --> 00:04:05.660
Try some, then decide.

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:07.500
Your noodles.

00:04:09.381 --> 00:04:10.460
Come on, taste it.

00:04:11.581 --> 00:04:12.301
Thank you.

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:13.541
Enjoy your meal.

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:20.501
This shop fuels me up.

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.741
Whenever I'm stressed or upset,

00:04:23.141 --> 00:04:24.061
I come for a bowl.

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:25.821
It's really that magical.

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.980
You'll feel better.

00:04:27.701 --> 00:04:28.261
Try it.

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:44.261
It's really good.

00:04:46.061 --> 00:04:47.540
I wrongly accused you earlier.

00:04:48.501 --> 00:04:49.100
This is on me.

00:04:53.141 --> 00:04:55.061
When that Warm Nest video surfaced,

00:04:56.141 --> 00:04:57.021
I was really scared.

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.181
But someone told me,

00:04:59.581 --> 00:05:01.141
"If you want to be a lawyer,

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:03.780
learn to fight for your rights."

00:05:05.821 --> 00:05:07.340
Guo Xiaoyu, this goes for you too.

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.141
Though I don't know your situation,

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:11.900
if you feel wronged,

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:13.540
demand fairness.

00:05:13.621 --> 00:05:14.501
Stand up for yourself.

00:05:18.181 --> 00:05:20.701
After what you told me,

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:22.660
I can probably guess.

00:05:23.381 --> 00:05:24.420
It was Huang Yue.

00:05:25.821 --> 00:05:28.141
She looked at my computer last night.

00:05:28.741 --> 00:05:30.460
With her tech skills,

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.100
she'd memorize that URL instantly.

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:34.261
Our group's proposal

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:37.300
was actually Huang Yue's idea.

00:05:39.821 --> 00:05:41.340
But I've got no solid evidence

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:42.900
that she copied it.

00:05:43.381 --> 00:05:44.581
Is it possible

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:46.821
that she came up with this herself?

00:05:47.581 --> 00:05:49.540
Actually, the idea's pretty common.

00:05:49.941 --> 00:05:51.660
Anybody could've thought of it.

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:53.900
Am I being conceited

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:55.900
to think she copied me?

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:58.021
Drink?

00:06:15.941 --> 00:06:18.021
You said your idea was so ordinary.

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:19.220
Anyone could think of it.

00:06:19.821 --> 00:06:21.220
Well, I couldn't think of it.

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:23.141
Because in my knowledge framework,

00:06:23.621 --> 00:06:25.340
there's no trace of that anime website.

00:06:26.141 --> 00:06:28.300
This is your unique approach
to solving problems.

00:06:28.621 --> 00:06:29.900
How could you lack confidence?

00:06:31.021 --> 00:06:32.540
You're usually so aloof.

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:35.381
How come you talk
so much after drinking?

00:06:35.741 --> 00:06:36.900
Ren Jiatong.

00:06:40.501 --> 00:06:42.061
Are you drunk?

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:45.581
You're the drunk one.

00:06:46.021 --> 00:06:47.220
I've only had one glass, okay?

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:51.701
I think I might be a little drunk.

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:54.701
I'm seeing double vision
when I look at you.

00:07:11.021 --> 00:07:11.941
Goodness.

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:22.581
You're awake. Are you okay?

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:23.840
Morning.

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:25.780
Your alcohol tolerance is so low.

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:27.300
So hard to get you back here.

00:07:28.141 --> 00:07:30.780
I didn't do anything embarrassing
last night, did I?

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:32.384
No.

00:07:33.261 --> 00:07:35.261
You just cursed someone
named Zhu Zhisheng,

00:07:35.381 --> 00:07:36.741
whined about Jun An's retention

00:07:36.821 --> 00:07:37.900
and the territorial marking

00:07:38.181 --> 00:07:39.141
brought up

00:07:39.141 --> 00:07:40.821
by your picky roommate,

00:07:42.701 --> 00:07:44.261
and mentioned seeing double vision.

00:07:44.501 --> 00:07:45.300
I had to steady you.

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:46.141
Hold on, hold on.

00:07:46.261 --> 00:07:47.061
Stop talking.

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:49.420
I was drunk, okay?

00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:50.941
Don't take it to heart.

00:07:52.381 --> 00:07:52.992
Hold on.

00:07:55.941 --> 00:07:56.860
Double vision.

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:02.941
Great! Thank you.

00:08:03.141 --> 00:08:03.980
I figured it out.

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:05.381
Figured what out?

00:08:05.381 --> 00:08:06.181
Double vision.

00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:08.621
It's hard to explain.

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:09.860
You'll know later.

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:17.501
I might be late.

00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:19.141
Ask for leave on my behalf.

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:20.420
Thanks.

00:08:55.341 --> 00:08:57.540
This manga character's name is Xiaoxiao,

00:08:57.780 --> 00:08:59.341
but I searched online last night

00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:00.580
and found the author

00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:02.420
had never admitted or suggested

00:09:02.461 --> 00:09:04.580
in any public forum

00:09:04.861 --> 00:09:05.700
that this character

00:09:05.741 --> 00:09:07.741
was based on the real-life celebrity,

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:08.501
Ms. Xiao.

00:09:08.981 --> 00:09:11.341
That's just an assumption made
by netizens in the comments.

00:09:12.341 --> 00:09:13.341
So you're saying

00:09:13.341 --> 00:09:14.981
that the manga itself

00:09:14.981 --> 00:09:16.461
isn't sufficient to prove

00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:18.780
that the person in the ad is Ms. Xiao.

00:09:19.021 --> 00:09:21.021
We need stronger evidence.

00:09:22.611 --> 00:09:24.540
(Isabelle Aesthetic and Plastic
Surgery Hospital)

00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:25.861
Sorry, I'm late, everyone.

00:09:28.501 --> 00:09:29.660
I have some new findings.

00:09:35.059 --> 00:09:36.780
(Aesthetic and Plastic Surgery Hospital)

00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:38.501
This is a contour line drawing I made

00:09:38.501 --> 00:09:39.981
by removing the accessories

00:09:39.981 --> 00:09:41.621
from her photo shoot image.

00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:45.248
Thanks.

00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:58.700
The contours are identical.

00:10:00.101 --> 00:10:01.780
This is what you meant
by "double vision"?

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:04.341
Yes. Looking just at the photo,

00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:06.741
the outfit has
too many complex decorations,

00:10:06.741 --> 00:10:08.261
making it impossible to see

00:10:08.261 --> 00:10:09.981
the real torso clearly.

00:10:10.261 --> 00:10:11.700
But my line drawing,

00:10:11.741 --> 00:10:13.621
by stripping away all that complexity,

00:10:13.621 --> 00:10:14.940
clearly shows

00:10:15.461 --> 00:10:17.780
the manga character's pose and angle

00:10:17.861 --> 00:10:19.341
actually come from this photo.

00:10:21.381 --> 00:10:22.501
Nice work, Xiaoyu.

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:24.141
I didn't know you could draw.

00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:27.180
Great thinking. Unconventional.

00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:28.780
This young lady did very well.

00:10:29.261 --> 00:10:30.820
Her name's Guo Xiaoyu. Gen Z.

00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:32.900
The youngest candidate among them.

00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:37.981
In our daily casework,

00:10:38.341 --> 00:10:40.621
we constantly encounter fresh concepts.

00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:43.008
That's a real challenge for us lawyers.

00:10:43.621 --> 00:10:44.660
Today's law firms

00:10:45.261 --> 00:10:47.021
need young talents like you all.

00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:48.780
Times have changed.

00:10:49.501 --> 00:10:51.981
We can't just bury ourselves
in laws and regulations.

00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:53.741
Beyond the law,

00:10:53.861 --> 00:10:57.101
it's best to have
varied interests and hobbies.

00:10:57.381 --> 00:10:58.016
Look at

00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:00.580
Guo Xiaoyu's drawing.

00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:01.300
How good.

00:11:02.021 --> 00:11:04.580
Xiaoyu, I'll ask for your guidance
on drawing sometime.

00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:05.780
I'm flattered.

00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:07.021
Thank you.

00:11:11.341 --> 00:11:13.101
For this task, all members

00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:14.900
of Guo Xiaoyu's team get a 20 bonus.

00:11:18.261 --> 00:11:19.540
Thank you, Mr. Zhuang, Mr. Zhou.

00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:20.741
Thank you. Thank you.

00:11:35.021 --> 00:11:35.712
Mr. Zhou.

00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:37.940
Now, I have the lowest score.

00:11:38.341 --> 00:11:40.180
Am I the one getting
eliminated this round?

00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:44.420
Ms. Bai, Mr. Song, and I discussed it.

00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:45.621
Your first time.

00:11:45.861 --> 00:11:47.621
It should serve as adaptive training

00:11:47.861 --> 00:11:48.940
to help you quickly adjust

00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:50.700
to the work rhythm and environment here.

00:11:51.261 --> 00:11:51.940
So...

00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:52.940
No one will be out?

00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:56.300
That's right.

00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:58.381
Eliminations officially
start next round.

00:12:00.981 --> 00:12:01.536
Mr. Zhou.

00:12:02.221 --> 00:12:03.261
Our previous scores?

00:12:06.501 --> 00:12:07.861
The previous points

00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:09.700
won't carry over.

00:12:10.208 --> 00:12:10.820
Of course.

00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:12.341
The past two weeks weren't a joke.

00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:13.780
We reward your efforts.

00:12:14.261 --> 00:12:15.341
In the next round,

00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:18.141
Wang Lu, ranked last,
starts with minus ten points.

00:12:18.861 --> 00:12:20.300
Huang Yue, second from the bottom,

00:12:20.741 --> 00:12:21.820
starts with minus five.

00:12:22.101 --> 00:12:22.741
In other words,

00:12:23.021 --> 00:12:25.021
you must score significantly higher

00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:27.221
to stand any chance of staying.

00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:31.621
The top five will receive
rewards based on rank.

00:12:32.141 --> 00:12:32.900
The top Jiang Chen

00:12:33.461 --> 00:12:35.341
gains immunity from one elimination.

00:12:36.101 --> 00:12:38.300
Second place,
Ren Jiatong and Guo Xiaoyu.

00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:41.261
You get five bonus points
added to the next task's scores.

00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:43.900
Third place, Yan Fei and Li Ke.

00:12:44.501 --> 00:12:46.300
You start the next task with zero.

00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:55.021
Get some proper rest tonight.

00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:57.700
The real competition begins now.

00:12:59.381 --> 00:12:59.981
Go for it.

00:13:00.341 --> 00:13:00.960
Go for it.

00:13:08.741 --> 00:13:11.101
We all made it through the first round.

00:13:11.221 --> 00:13:12.221
No one got eliminated.

00:13:12.608 --> 00:13:13.420
So what's the plan?

00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:14.540
Celebration dinner tonight?

00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:15.580
New hot pot place nearby.

00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:17.700
Every time I pass by,

00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:18.780
there's always a queue.

00:13:19.101 --> 00:13:20.141
It must be really good.

00:13:20.741 --> 00:13:21.660
I'll sit this one out.

00:13:23.261 --> 00:13:23.940
Huang Xiaoyue,

00:13:24.861 --> 00:13:27.060
your team's proposal this round

00:13:27.141 --> 00:13:29.381
was miles behind ours,

00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:30.940
but you still need to eat.

00:13:32.261 --> 00:13:32.981
Technically,

00:13:32.981 --> 00:13:34.221
that proposal's copyright

00:13:34.221 --> 00:13:35.180
belongs to Guo Xiaoyu.

00:13:36.141 --> 00:13:37.221
But we're a team

00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:38.420
with team spirit.

00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:39.900
Credit doesn't matter, right?

00:13:40.861 --> 00:13:41.861
Jokes aside.

00:13:42.261 --> 00:13:43.501
We survived round one.

00:13:43.981 --> 00:13:46.180
But the next round gets real.

00:13:46.621 --> 00:13:47.580
People are getting cut.

00:13:47.981 --> 00:13:49.261
So we should definitely

00:13:49.261 --> 00:13:50.021
have dinner.

00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:52.221
It's fate we all met.

00:13:55.501 --> 00:13:56.580
Guo Xiaoyu should treat us.

00:13:58.861 --> 00:13:59.501
Me?

00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:01.180
You were the first one Mr. Zhuang

00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:02.341
personally praised.

00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:04.461
I just paid my rent.

00:14:04.981 --> 00:14:06.580
Stop putting her on the spot.

00:14:08.461 --> 00:14:10.141
What's with the hero act?

00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:11.648
Jiang Chen.

00:14:12.261 --> 00:14:13.180
Are you two a thing?

00:14:13.741 --> 00:14:14.900
Ren Jiatong, as her roommate,

00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:15.780
do you know anything?

00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:20.780
I have a boyfriend.

00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:22.208
Alright.

00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:23.180
Well then.

00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:24.101
I'll reserve seats.

00:14:24.101 --> 00:14:25.180
Let's count...

00:14:25.381 --> 00:14:25.940
Seven.

00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:27.221
I'll book a large table.

00:14:28.021 --> 00:14:28.741
Will Yan Fei come?

00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:31.341
She left with her bag

00:14:31.341 --> 00:14:32.141
at 6:03 PM.

00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:33.180
Okay.

00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:34.580
Text her to confirm.

00:14:34.981 --> 00:14:35.501
I'm going.

00:14:43.741 --> 00:14:44.420
Give it two days.

00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:46.221
That cosmetic ad should be taken down.

00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:48.660
No more case talk outside the office.

00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:49.621
Focus on

00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:51.501
hot pot ingredients, ice jelly,

00:14:52.261 --> 00:14:52.981
and tripe.

00:14:52.981 --> 00:14:54.060
Yue mentioned recently

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:55.141
you were craving tripe.

00:14:57.501 --> 00:14:58.021
See you.

00:14:58.021 --> 00:14:59.381
Go ahead. I'm taking this.

00:15:00.021 --> 00:15:00.621
I'll wait.

00:15:03.379 --> 00:15:04.832
(Zhubao)

00:15:05.172 --> 00:15:06.144
(Zhubao(6))

00:15:28.741 --> 00:15:29.261
Zhubao.

00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:32.381
I was in the elevator
and missed your call earlier.

00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:34.381
Xiaoyu, I've already taken leave.

00:15:35.101 --> 00:15:36.501
I've been exhausted these days.

00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:37.820
I worked overtime.

00:15:38.141 --> 00:15:39.820
The director worried I'd collapse

00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:40.940
and approved my leave.

00:15:41.261 --> 00:15:42.940
Oh, and I've booked the ticket.

00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:45.021
I'll come to Beijing tomorrow.

00:15:45.221 --> 00:15:45.981
Are you happy?

00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:49.021
Why aren't you saying anything?

00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:50.176
Xiaoyu?

00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:52.384
Xiaoyu?

00:15:54.021 --> 00:15:54.621
Sweetheart.

00:15:56.900 --> 00:15:58.700
I might not return to Hangzhou.

00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:01.180
Guo Xiaoyu!

00:16:02.141 --> 00:16:03.461
Are you messing with me?

00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:05.180
Why?

00:16:06.341 --> 00:16:08.060
P-Please don't get mad, okay?

00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:09.261
I'm not messing with you.

00:16:09.621 --> 00:16:10.660
It's just that I feel like

00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:11.820
I can push a little longer.

00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:13.420
And I don't want to admit

00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:15.021
defeat early and flee back home.

00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:16.540
I'm not doing too badly after all.

00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:17.180
Today,

00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:18.180
the director praised me.

00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:19.060
Do whatever you want.

00:16:52.221 --> 00:16:53.180
Where did Guo Xiaoyu go

00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:54.540
to answer that call?

00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:56.300
Did the joke about making her pay

00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:57.580
scare her off?

00:16:58.540 --> 00:16:59.820
Yan Fei isn't here either.

00:17:00.261 --> 00:17:01.700
Yan Fei? That's different.

00:17:02.141 --> 00:17:03.300
She's not like us.

00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:05.060
We aren't in the same league.

00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:05.664
Enough.

00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:07.261
No backbiting.

00:17:08.501 --> 00:17:09.300
Just joking around.

00:17:09.741 --> 00:17:10.540
Ren Jiatong,

00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:11.261
you're great.

00:17:12.221 --> 00:17:13.100
But you're too aloof.

00:17:14.221 --> 00:17:15.620
When we toasted earlier,

00:17:15.620 --> 00:17:16.701
you didn't drink with us.

00:17:17.261 --> 00:17:18.060
You didn't raise it.

00:17:18.661 --> 00:17:19.701
Here's to you.

00:17:20.261 --> 00:17:21.580
You were the very first person

00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:23.021
I met at Jun An.

00:17:23.661 --> 00:17:24.820
For that reason, let's drink.

00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:28.580
Just one glass, okay? Come on.

00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:30.976
I'll take this.

00:17:34.701 --> 00:17:35.540
What a nice guy.

00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:36.461
You defended Guo Xiaoyu

00:17:36.461 --> 00:17:37.181
and Ren Jiatong.

00:17:37.181 --> 00:17:38.580
Two people in a day. Is it good?

00:17:38.981 --> 00:17:39.860
That's my style.

00:17:40.221 --> 00:17:40.741
- Fine.
- Cheers.

00:17:41.901 --> 00:17:42.528
Cheers.

00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:43.661
Are you sure?

00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:45.184
Fine.

00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:46.820
I'll drink half.

00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:51.540
Are you okay?

00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:55.780
There's gossip.

00:17:56.421 --> 00:17:57.340
Mr. Song and Ms. Bai

00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:00.060
used to be together before.

00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:02.181
Senior lawyers mentioned it.

00:18:02.221 --> 00:18:04.060
When Mr. Song and Ms. Bai were young,

00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:05.181
they apparently dated.

00:18:05.221 --> 00:18:07.100
But nobody knows the specifics.

00:18:07.701 --> 00:18:09.060
It could just be rumors though.

00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:11.580
Well, it is gossip.

00:18:12.021 --> 00:18:13.620
Who needs that much rigor in gossip?

00:18:13.661 --> 00:18:14.580
Don't be so serious.

00:18:15.461 --> 00:18:16.000
Then...

00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:18.021
Doesn't Ms. Bai have a child?

00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:20.941
Could the child be Mr. Song's?

00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:21.741
Probably not.

00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:23.300
I heard from Duoduo

00:18:23.501 --> 00:18:25.100
soon after Ms. Bai
and Mr. Song broke up,

00:18:25.501 --> 00:18:26.540
she married someone.

00:18:26.901 --> 00:18:28.340
Her husband wasn't in law anyway.

00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:30.661
She divorced when the kid was three.

00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:32.100
She's been single since.

00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:33.941
And Mr. Song never married.

00:18:35.461 --> 00:18:37.340
Their relationship
seems perfectly fine now.

00:18:37.981 --> 00:18:38.941
Can't they make up?

00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:39.860
Not allowed.

00:18:42.701 --> 00:18:43.501
Jun An's policy

00:18:43.501 --> 00:18:45.060
discourages workplace romances.

00:18:45.261 --> 00:18:46.140
Partners or staff,

00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:46.981
it's the same rule.

00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:48.221
If two people

00:18:48.221 --> 00:18:49.221
in one group date,

00:18:49.461 --> 00:18:50.501
one will have to leave.

00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:53.380
I just started shipping them,

00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:55.380
only to find bitterness.

00:18:56.620 --> 00:18:57.901
This firm rule

00:18:58.181 --> 00:18:59.741
is so unreasonable, don't you think?

00:19:00.261 --> 00:19:01.100
Just think about it.

00:19:01.181 --> 00:19:03.340
We had to find a partner

00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:04.860
during college.

00:19:05.221 --> 00:19:06.580
Otherwise, with this workload,

00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:07.701
who'd have time for dating?

00:19:07.981 --> 00:19:09.140
We work extreme hours.

00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:10.300
After joining Jun An,

00:19:10.421 --> 00:19:11.741
I never get to bed before 1 AM.

00:19:12.501 --> 00:19:13.140
Not only you.

00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:14.780
My hairstyle is doomed.

00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:16.620
I lose hair fast. I dread washing it.

00:19:19.501 --> 00:19:20.741
Too bad? That joke?

00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:22.701
Let's drink.

00:19:32.981 --> 00:19:34.100
I need to use the restroom.

00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:37.056
Wang Lu.

00:19:38.181 --> 00:19:39.300
What games do you play?

00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:45.941
(Not our place
to judge your relationship.)

00:19:46.048 --> 00:19:48.741
But I do think
it's good to follow your heart.

00:19:49.981 --> 00:19:51.701
And please stop crying now.

00:19:52.421 --> 00:19:53.300
Or people will assume

00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:54.380
I did something to you.

00:19:56.021 --> 00:19:57.981
I just got snot on your clothes.

00:19:58.421 --> 00:20:00.501
Want me to take it home and wash it?

00:20:00.501 --> 00:20:02.741
Or I could buy you
a new one to replace it.

00:20:06.021 --> 00:20:06.741
Honestly,

00:20:07.461 --> 00:20:08.221
it's costly.

00:20:11.701 --> 00:20:13.060
I'm sorry, Yan Fei.

00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:18.380
Don't apologize to me. No need.

00:20:19.181 --> 00:20:19.860
Then...

00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:22.501
can we still be friends?

00:20:23.941 --> 00:20:24.580
I've told you.

00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:27.021
I didn't come here to make friends.

00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:35.981
Let's go. Didn't they mention

00:20:36.501 --> 00:20:37.820
a dinner gathering or something?

00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:41.421
You're forgiving me?

00:20:41.741 --> 00:20:42.780
Don't misunderstand.

00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:44.421
This is just a colleague dinner.

00:20:45.741 --> 00:20:46.901
No misunderstanding here.

00:20:47.421 --> 00:20:49.221
Just colleagues. I get it.

00:21:04.901 --> 00:21:05.461
How are you?

00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:06.340
Okay?

00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:11.421
You've asked me multiple times
if I'm okay today,

00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:13.300
hoping I'm not?

00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:15.021
No. I saw you constantly sipping

00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:17.421
hot water and holding your stomach.

00:21:18.021 --> 00:21:19.421
D-Did you eat something bad?

00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:20.300
I have medicine.

00:21:21.701 --> 00:21:23.221
My stomach's fine. It's actually...

00:21:26.421 --> 00:21:27.140
To be honest,

00:21:27.261 --> 00:21:28.021
my uterus

00:21:28.021 --> 00:21:30.060
is periodically bleeding and shedding

00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:30.620
its lining

00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:32.661
along with the cyclical changes
of my ovaries.

00:21:32.661 --> 00:21:33.701
Commonly known as...

00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:35.340
menstruation.

00:21:45.221 --> 00:21:46.380
You need to go home and rest?

00:21:47.701 --> 00:21:48.501
Drink warm water.

00:21:52.981 --> 00:21:53.501
Well,

00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:54.741
I'm sorry.

00:21:56.620 --> 00:21:57.741
Yesterday morning,

00:21:58.701 --> 00:21:59.661
I might be too harsh.

00:22:00.701 --> 00:22:02.221
I've been wanting to apologize to you.

00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:20.860
What? Line at the restroom?

00:22:24.701 --> 00:22:25.380
Ren Jiatong.

00:22:25.981 --> 00:22:27.140
Why is your face so red?

00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:27.981
Feeling unwell?

00:22:28.896 --> 00:22:29.501
I'm fine.

00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:30.461
Just stuffy inside.

00:22:31.421 --> 00:22:32.140
So suffocating.

00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:33.380
Y-You can go check.

00:22:39.741 --> 00:22:41.741
Why didn't you guys wait for us?

00:22:41.741 --> 00:22:43.941
Now, there's only
one piece of tripe left.

00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:46.100
I still remember our first day.

00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:47.100
You were eating nonstop.

00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:49.421
I thought, "This girl is so carefree."

00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:51.100
That was just me being dumb.

00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:52.221
Ignorance is bliss.

00:22:54.820 --> 00:22:56.021
Why don't we share

00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:56.981
who impressed us most

00:22:57.021 --> 00:22:59.181
on our first day at the firm?

00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:01.060
You'll say Ren Jiatong, right?

00:23:01.261 --> 00:23:02.421
Actually, no.

00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:04.021
Because the night before,

00:23:04.021 --> 00:23:06.501
I'd already witnessed
her bold, flashy confidence.

00:23:06.741 --> 00:23:09.620
For me, it was Wang Lu.

00:23:12.221 --> 00:23:12.800
Me?

00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:15.100
Back then, I really wanted to ask you

00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:17.501
why you transferred
from Jun An's internship

00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:18.701
to the Talent Hunt Program.

00:23:19.261 --> 00:23:21.380
Honestly, I wanted speed.

00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:23.901
To prove myself faster,

00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:25.941
work on cases
with senior lawyers faster,

00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:26.901
and secure a spot.

00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:28.981
A regular intern

00:23:28.981 --> 00:23:30.620
only stays three to six months

00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:32.100
and then leaves,

00:23:32.860 --> 00:23:34.941
never getting real case experience
with seniors.

00:23:35.261 --> 00:23:36.941
At best, with someone like Mr. Zhou,

00:23:36.941 --> 00:23:37.941
a mid-level associate.

00:23:38.661 --> 00:23:40.100
The Talent Hunt Program changes it.

00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:42.701
Just look at Ren Jiatong.

00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:44.941
Working with Ms. Bai from the start.

00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:47.580
Most interns wouldn't even dream of it.

00:23:49.501 --> 00:23:50.140
Impressive.

00:23:52.501 --> 00:23:53.661
But if it were me,

00:23:54.261 --> 00:23:55.741
I'd never have your courage.

00:23:56.380 --> 00:23:57.780
So if I can't stay,

00:23:58.340 --> 00:23:59.300
I won't go back.

00:24:00.021 --> 00:24:01.941
After all, my mentor lawyer

00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:03.300
was really great to me.

00:24:03.901 --> 00:24:05.221
Even now, I can't figure out

00:24:05.221 --> 00:24:05.901
why, to this day,

00:24:06.701 --> 00:24:08.100
I'm still ranked last.

00:24:08.981 --> 00:24:09.860
It's fine. Come on.

00:24:20.221 --> 00:24:21.580
Let me speak from the heart here.

00:24:22.461 --> 00:24:24.540
Ren Jiatong, honestly,

00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:25.780
I'm jealous of you.

00:24:26.901 --> 00:24:27.701
But truthfully,

00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:29.340
I genuinely admire you.

00:24:29.941 --> 00:24:30.860
Come on, cheers.

00:24:31.901 --> 00:24:32.860
I'll pour a drink.

00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:34.261
I've got one poured already.

00:24:34.981 --> 00:24:35.712
Thanks.

00:24:36.701 --> 00:24:37.344
Cheers.

00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:39.461
Oh, come on.

00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:40.820
Admire her?

00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:43.580
I've seen a Bentley picking you up.

00:24:43.661 --> 00:24:44.580
That's your boyfriend?

00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:46.421
Annoying.

00:24:48.448 --> 00:24:49.261
Shut up.

00:24:56.901 --> 00:24:58.461
No need for jealousy here.

00:24:58.860 --> 00:25:00.941
We're all pretty awesome
in our own ways.

00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:03.100
Huang Yue, cheers.

00:25:03.104 --> 00:25:03.780
Cheers.

00:25:07.379 --> 00:25:11.744
(Ren Jiatong:
Thanks for swapping my beer for tea.)

00:25:11.744 --> 00:25:13.140
(Jiang Chen: Don't mention it.)

00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:14.701
Guo Xiaoyu, you better slow down.

00:25:15.421 --> 00:25:16.620
Drowning her sorrows.

00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:17.860
Boyfriend trouble.

00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:19.701
Sorrow? No way.

00:25:21.021 --> 00:25:22.540
No matter what, I'm staying in Beijing

00:25:22.981 --> 00:25:23.820
and Jun An.

00:25:24.661 --> 00:25:26.181
He claims to like me all the time,

00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:28.661
so why won't he come to Beijing for me?

00:25:29.261 --> 00:25:30.860
Why should I chase after him?

00:25:32.421 --> 00:25:32.981
Exactly.

00:25:33.501 --> 00:25:34.300
I'm staying too.

00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:36.380
Since childhood,

00:25:36.540 --> 00:25:38.501
I've been demanded
perfection by my parents.

00:25:38.901 --> 00:25:40.380
I never once got a "good".

00:25:40.380 --> 00:25:41.100
Only "excellent".

00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:43.421
How could I fail to stay?

00:25:46.461 --> 00:25:47.040
Alright.

00:25:47.981 --> 00:25:49.620
Now that the mood is right,

00:25:50.780 --> 00:25:52.540
and the seven of us
are finally together,

00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:53.860
let me speak.

00:25:54.701 --> 00:25:56.181
Spare us the speech.

00:25:56.860 --> 00:25:59.300
Do all student council presidents

00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:01.100
get the same training manual?

00:26:01.181 --> 00:26:03.501
Why that identical formal tone?

00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:04.140
Sorry.

00:26:04.181 --> 00:26:05.701
The emotions just took over.

00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:06.421
I can't keep

00:26:06.701 --> 00:26:08.060
this in any longer.

00:26:08.741 --> 00:26:11.820
In just two weeks of bonding,

00:26:12.261 --> 00:26:13.741
we've built real team spirit.

00:26:14.741 --> 00:26:15.741
What is team spirit?

00:26:15.901 --> 00:26:16.820
Enough, President Li.

00:26:17.181 --> 00:26:20.580
Too many corporate dinners ruined you.

00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:24.221
Skip the "past and future" talk.

00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:26.461
Just drink.

00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:27.421
Fine.

00:26:27.421 --> 00:26:27.981
Sure.

00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:30.340
Sincerely wishing

00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:31.501
we all can finally

00:26:32.021 --> 00:26:32.780
stay.

00:26:33.060 --> 00:26:34.140
Stay!

00:26:34.181 --> 00:26:35.741
- Stay!
- Cheers!

00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:46.901
Work already?

00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:50.421
I'm so sleepy.

00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:52.261
I can't take it.

00:26:55.261 --> 00:26:55.820
Huang Xiaoyue,

00:26:57.060 --> 00:26:58.580
your dark circles are pronounced.

00:26:58.580 --> 00:26:59.741
Did something upset you?

00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:02.501
You look awful.

00:27:02.501 --> 00:27:03.580
Are you sick?

00:27:03.981 --> 00:27:05.701
Maybe go home and rest for the day?

00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:07.741
I just overdid the drinks last night.

00:27:08.261 --> 00:27:10.140
Way too much drinking happened.

00:27:10.501 --> 00:27:12.261
If Ren Jiatong hadn't woken me,

00:27:12.261 --> 00:27:13.421
I'd have been late again.

00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:15.021
Love you.

00:27:15.421 --> 00:27:16.941
You saved my life.

00:27:20.901 --> 00:27:21.421
Yan Fei.

00:27:22.944 --> 00:27:23.540
Mr. Zhou.

00:27:24.661 --> 00:27:26.780
Seems nobody rested well last night.

00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:28.780
Everyone's dragging.

00:27:30.701 --> 00:27:31.380
It's okay.

00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:33.300
I have an announcement

00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:34.221
to cheer you up.

00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:38.140
The second round
of the Talent Hunt Program begins now.

00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:41.221
There's only one task for this round.

00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:43.461
The deadline is today.

00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:44.620
- Today?
- Today?

00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:46.620
All materials

00:27:47.060 --> 00:27:48.421
have been sent to your email.

00:27:48.620 --> 00:27:49.461
Please review them.

00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:51.340
Let me briefly outline

00:27:51.340 --> 00:27:52.300
the case details.

00:27:53.261 --> 00:27:53.941
Our clients

00:27:54.261 --> 00:27:56.340
are Ms. Tan and her agency.

00:27:56.901 --> 00:27:58.580
(Case Introduction)
Ha'erjian Foods

00:27:58.620 --> 00:27:59.540
went to Ms. Tan

00:27:59.901 --> 00:28:01.540
to invite her to endorse

00:28:01.540 --> 00:28:02.100
their candies.

00:28:02.368 --> 00:28:03.820
(Case Introduction)
As requested,

00:28:04.021 --> 00:28:05.780
they've submitted promotional materials

00:28:06.140 --> 00:28:07.741
and product certifications

00:28:08.221 --> 00:28:09.060
in the email.

00:28:09.661 --> 00:28:10.380
Your assignment

00:28:10.461 --> 00:28:11.501
is to prepare

00:28:11.741 --> 00:28:14.380
a brief legal memorandum for Ms. Tan,

00:28:14.981 --> 00:28:16.540
assessing whether she can sign it

00:28:16.780 --> 00:28:18.340
and outlining associated risks.

00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:20.340
Am I clear?

00:28:22.620 --> 00:28:23.820
One more thing.

00:28:24.340 --> 00:28:25.780
This is individual scoring.

00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:27.981
The top three performers will get

00:28:27.981 --> 00:28:30.100
30, 20 and 10 points accordingly.

00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:32.380
The lowest cumulative scorer
faces elimination.

00:28:33.461 --> 00:28:34.540
What's the DDL?

00:28:35.701 --> 00:28:36.860
Midnight tonight.

00:28:50.901 --> 00:28:52.540
I'm so nervous that I might throw up.

00:28:54.941 --> 00:28:56.421
Wang Lu, give me some of your goji

00:28:56.421 --> 00:28:57.300
to replenish my blood.

00:28:58.060 --> 00:28:58.624
Thanks.

00:29:04.261 --> 00:29:06.461
The elimination notice
really dampened the mood.

00:29:06.661 --> 00:29:08.580
Here's some good news
to lighten things up.

00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:10.941
Young lady.

00:29:10.941 --> 00:29:12.060
- You're here, sir?
- Hello.

00:29:12.256 --> 00:29:12.941
- Hello.
- Sir.

00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:15.860
Ren Jiatong and Jiang Chen

00:29:15.860 --> 00:29:17.501
went to the community legal aid event.

00:29:17.701 --> 00:29:18.421
They provided

00:29:18.421 --> 00:29:20.261
legal consultation for this man,

00:29:20.661 --> 00:29:21.701
and he was very satisfied.

00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:24.300
Not only did he
retain Jun An for his case,

00:29:24.421 --> 00:29:26.421
he also wrote this thank-you letter

00:29:26.701 --> 00:29:27.620
and sent it today.

00:29:29.540 --> 00:29:32.181
That young lady is so considerate.

00:29:32.620 --> 00:29:33.661
Knowing my old age,

00:29:33.981 --> 00:29:35.421
she made enlarged print copies

00:29:35.421 --> 00:29:36.780
of all documents,

00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:38.941
so I could read without glasses.

00:29:38.941 --> 00:29:39.616
Right?

00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:41.620
It's nothing, sir.

00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:43.860
Mr. Song

00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:44.860
just commended you two

00:29:45.221 --> 00:29:46.941
for your bold hypotheses

00:29:46.981 --> 00:29:47.860
and careful checks.

00:29:47.941 --> 00:29:49.261
Your opinions were well-written.

00:29:51.620 --> 00:29:53.941
Ren Jiatong deserves the most credit.

00:29:54.221 --> 00:29:55.780
We disagreed on core approaches,

00:29:55.780 --> 00:29:57.021
so my contribution was limited.

00:29:57.461 --> 00:29:59.580
But she put in tremendous work.

00:30:00.261 --> 00:30:00.780
No, no.

00:30:00.981 --> 00:30:02.540
She specifically told me

00:30:02.981 --> 00:30:04.140
you pulled an all-nighter,

00:30:04.501 --> 00:30:06.501
cross-checking the film subtitles,

00:30:06.501 --> 00:30:07.981
reviewing word by word.

00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:09.140
Thank you.

00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:12.901
Your prestigious law firm

00:30:13.421 --> 00:30:15.461
helped an old man like me so much

00:30:15.461 --> 00:30:16.960
without charging a penny.

00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:17.981
It's our duty.

00:30:18.221 --> 00:30:20.701
Pro bono legal services

00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:21.780
are always free.

00:30:22.701 --> 00:30:23.540
Don't worry.

00:30:23.580 --> 00:30:25.461
The firm will reward their work.

00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:27.261
Great.

00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:31.221
I won't keep you

00:30:31.221 --> 00:30:32.421
since you're all so busy.

00:30:33.860 --> 00:30:35.060
Come visit me sometime.

00:30:35.421 --> 00:30:37.021
I'll cook you noodles with fried sauce.

00:30:37.981 --> 00:30:38.661
Thank you.

00:30:38.741 --> 00:30:39.300
- Yes.
- Okay.

00:30:39.340 --> 00:30:40.380
- Yes.
- I'll walk you out.

00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:41.901
Okay. Goodbye.

00:30:42.181 --> 00:30:42.752
Goodbye.

00:30:44.701 --> 00:30:45.221
Mr. Zhou.

00:30:46.501 --> 00:30:48.820
Will the reward include bonus points?

00:30:51.741 --> 00:30:52.661
Focus on your report.

00:30:57.555 --> 00:30:58.720
(Script Plagiarism Case +10)

00:30:59.091 --> 00:31:00.864
(Script Plagiarism Case +10)

00:31:32.060 --> 00:31:32.741
Hello?

00:31:32.741 --> 00:31:35.021
Jiatong, did you see my WeChat message?

00:31:35.780 --> 00:31:36.701
I need your help.

00:31:37.140 --> 00:31:38.021
I can't talk now.

00:31:38.021 --> 00:31:39.021
Call me tonight.

00:31:39.461 --> 00:31:40.140
I got to go.

00:31:40.261 --> 00:31:41.060
Don't hang up.

00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:42.501
Really an emergency.

00:31:43.021 --> 00:31:44.140
I'm right downstairs.

00:31:44.741 --> 00:31:45.901
If you're busy,

00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:46.901
I can come up.

00:31:47.340 --> 00:31:48.140
Don't come up.

00:31:49.060 --> 00:31:49.941
I'll come down now.

00:31:59.060 --> 00:31:59.680
Mr. Zhou.

00:32:01.741 --> 00:32:03.021
I have an urgent matter.

00:32:03.021 --> 00:32:04.780
Could I take half an hour off to go out?

00:32:05.181 --> 00:32:05.820
Leave?

00:32:06.461 --> 00:32:07.820
Today's the elimination round.

00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:09.181
I have to remind you.

00:32:09.461 --> 00:32:10.661
The praise letter is good.

00:32:10.780 --> 00:32:12.661
But that doesn't count
toward the evaluation.

00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:14.380
Understood. I'll be back soon.

00:32:14.540 --> 00:32:15.741
Fine, I'll approve your leave.

00:32:15.780 --> 00:32:16.661
Plan your time well.

00:32:29.340 --> 00:32:31.261
Ren Jiatong, are you okay?

00:32:31.580 --> 00:32:33.221
Why do you
keep asking the same question?

00:32:33.221 --> 00:32:34.181
You're hoping otherwise?

00:32:39.701 --> 00:32:40.701
Stop worrying about me.

00:32:40.860 --> 00:32:42.060
Go back to work now.

00:32:42.501 --> 00:32:43.580
The assessment is coming.

00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:44.860
Don't you care?

00:32:49.421 --> 00:32:51.501
I do care. I care deeply.

00:32:51.780 --> 00:32:52.741
That's why I won't lose.

00:33:03.603 --> 00:33:05.043
Help me one more time.

00:33:49.421 --> 00:33:50.100
Want some water?

00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:51.100
I'll get you some.

00:33:52.192 --> 00:33:52.780
No, thanks.

00:34:18.981 --> 00:34:19.861
You submitted yours?

00:34:20.341 --> 00:34:22.620
How come I'm surrounded
by all these amazing people?

00:34:23.501 --> 00:34:25.180
Aren't you almost done too? Keep going.

00:34:46.901 --> 00:34:48.381
Yue, your phone keeps ringing.

00:34:48.381 --> 00:34:49.821
Is it an important call?

00:34:50.421 --> 00:34:51.301
My work

00:34:51.301 --> 00:34:52.941
is the most important right now.

00:35:02.461 --> 00:35:03.381
You submitted yours?

00:35:04.941 --> 00:35:06.740
Save me, Yue!

00:35:10.707 --> 00:35:16.480
(My older guy)

00:35:38.421 --> 00:35:39.260
Finally finished.

00:35:40.821 --> 00:35:41.941
Yue, let's grab food later.

00:35:41.952 --> 00:35:42.540
Okay.

00:35:44.381 --> 00:35:45.341
How's your progress?

00:35:45.620 --> 00:35:46.540
Let's eat together.

00:35:47.021 --> 00:35:47.700
I'll pass.

00:35:52.288 --> 00:35:53.941
(Memo)
You've only written so little?

00:35:57.060 --> 00:35:58.981
What masterstroke are you brewing?

00:35:59.540 --> 00:36:00.740
I got held up earlier.

00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:02.421
But I'll make it.

00:36:03.421 --> 00:36:04.540
Go ahead without me.

00:36:07.540 --> 00:36:10.260
It's fine. We have
bonus points. Push on.

00:36:13.901 --> 00:36:14.560
Let's go.

00:36:15.421 --> 00:36:15.968
Go.

00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:22.740
- Bye.
- Bye.

00:37:04.948 --> 00:37:06.080
(Send: Memo on Endorsement
of Ha'erjian Candies)

00:37:23.901 --> 00:37:25.740
Ren Jiatong, you are
pushing way too hard.

00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:26.941
Morning.

00:37:28.100 --> 00:37:28.981
Mr. Zhou, morning.

00:37:29.341 --> 00:37:29.901
Morning.

00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:33.260
Ren Jiatong.

00:37:33.781 --> 00:37:34.981
The mentor lawyer told me

00:37:34.981 --> 00:37:36.540
you submitted yours past the DDL.

00:37:36.620 --> 00:37:37.180
Zero point.

00:37:37.180 --> 00:37:37.861
Go ask about it.

00:37:52.901 --> 00:37:53.620
Sorry about this.

00:37:54.100 --> 00:37:55.180
What's wrong with you?

00:37:55.740 --> 00:37:56.740
Why the rush?

00:37:57.140 --> 00:37:57.901
I need Mr. Song.

00:37:59.781 --> 00:38:00.821
He just went downstairs.

00:38:02.620 --> 00:38:03.220
Thank you.

00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:04.220
It's okay.

00:38:04.620 --> 00:38:05.580
- Sorry.
- Nothing. Go.

00:38:55.540 --> 00:38:56.140
Ms. Bai.

00:38:58.901 --> 00:38:59.660
Not coming in?

00:39:09.021 --> 00:39:09.540
Ms. Bai.

00:39:14.381 --> 00:39:15.540
I need to explain something.

00:39:18.341 --> 00:39:19.461
That's what happened.

00:39:19.700 --> 00:39:21.060
I didn't mean to miss the DDL.

00:39:21.540 --> 00:39:22.781
Can you please help me?

00:39:23.140 --> 00:39:24.781
At least review my report

00:39:24.781 --> 00:39:26.501
before deciding whether to score me.

00:39:27.501 --> 00:39:29.220
Stop insisting it wasn't intentional.

00:39:29.220 --> 00:39:30.821
I don't want to hear why.

00:39:31.381 --> 00:39:32.821
Just like no judge cares

00:39:32.821 --> 00:39:34.821
why a lawyer missed an appeal deadline.

00:39:35.381 --> 00:39:36.861
And personally,

00:39:37.140 --> 00:39:38.461
I see no reason

00:39:38.540 --> 00:39:40.060
worth missing even one minute.

00:39:40.301 --> 00:39:41.260
Forget one minute.

00:39:41.580 --> 00:39:42.700
Not even one second.

00:39:43.501 --> 00:39:44.341
For a lawyer,

00:39:44.341 --> 00:39:46.021
keeping promises is the most essential

00:39:46.260 --> 00:39:47.421
and fundamental virtue.

00:39:47.861 --> 00:39:50.461
It determines if you're trustworthy.

00:39:54.180 --> 00:39:55.740
Go wait for the results.

00:40:02.501 --> 00:40:04.901
I heard Ms. Bai rejected
Ren Jiatong's appeal.

00:40:05.220 --> 00:40:07.301
She might be in trouble this round.

00:40:08.540 --> 00:40:09.901
She must be frantic.

00:40:10.861 --> 00:40:12.021
But with her skills,

00:40:12.021 --> 00:40:14.220
she shouldn't have worked
until midnight to submit.

00:40:15.060 --> 00:40:17.781
Did she try to pull off
some grand move and mess it up?

00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:19.861
Ren Jiatong isn't like that.

00:40:20.461 --> 00:40:21.140
I know her.

00:40:21.140 --> 00:40:22.341
She wrote slowly yesterday.

00:40:22.781 --> 00:40:23.901
We already all submitted

00:40:23.901 --> 00:40:25.140
when she just started hers.

00:40:25.660 --> 00:40:27.301
I heard something delayed her.

00:40:28.060 --> 00:40:29.180
What could delay her?

00:40:30.540 --> 00:40:32.180
Ren Jiatong is so driven.

00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:33.861
What could make her
miss a knockout round?

00:40:34.688 --> 00:40:35.260
Oh, right.

00:40:35.381 --> 00:40:36.421
I saw her leave earlier.

00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:38.740
Did she get addicted to

00:40:38.740 --> 00:40:39.381
pro bono work?

00:40:39.381 --> 00:40:41.021
Helping another old man with paperwork?

00:40:42.781 --> 00:40:44.740
Ren Jiatong understands priorities.

00:40:45.381 --> 00:40:46.100
I don't think so.

00:41:15.580 --> 00:41:16.180
Jiatong,

00:41:17.501 --> 00:41:19.620
what really happened yesterday?

00:41:20.740 --> 00:41:22.501
If it was an emergency,

00:41:23.021 --> 00:41:24.140
maybe ask Mr. Song?

00:41:24.620 --> 00:41:25.821
I don't think he'd...

00:41:26.301 --> 00:41:26.944
It's fine.

00:41:28.260 --> 00:41:28.861
Ren Jiatong,

00:41:29.341 --> 00:41:30.220
something like this

00:41:30.501 --> 00:41:32.580
wouldn't be a big deal at other firms.

00:41:33.301 --> 00:41:34.620
But at Jun An,

00:41:35.220 --> 00:41:37.140
I doubt they'll let it slide easily.

00:41:39.381 --> 00:41:39.941
How about

00:41:41.100 --> 00:41:41.821
you leave?

00:41:45.740 --> 00:41:46.501
You quit.

00:41:47.260 --> 00:41:48.341
I'll ask around

00:41:48.341 --> 00:41:49.941
to see which firm can place you

00:41:50.021 --> 00:41:50.781
as an intern.

00:41:59.740 --> 00:42:00.740
No matter what,

00:42:00.781 --> 00:42:01.781
at least I'll have them

00:42:01.781 --> 00:42:03.220
read my report first.

00:42:03.941 --> 00:42:05.901
They can't just sentence me outright.

00:42:09.140 --> 00:42:09.728
Jiatong,

00:42:11.821 --> 00:42:12.540
I'm with you.

00:42:21.301 --> 00:42:21.821
Mr. Song,

00:42:22.100 --> 00:42:23.580
a document needs your signature.

00:42:23.981 --> 00:42:24.672
Okay.

00:42:36.224 --> 00:42:36.861
Done.

00:42:36.861 --> 00:42:37.501
Okay.

00:42:37.501 --> 00:42:38.060
Mr. Song.

00:42:40.021 --> 00:42:41.021
No need to say it.

00:42:42.861 --> 00:42:43.740
I read your report.

00:42:44.180 --> 00:42:45.301
It is well-written.

00:42:45.740 --> 00:42:47.140
But don't forget you work in law.

00:42:47.580 --> 00:42:48.461
You must follow rules

00:42:49.220 --> 00:42:50.381
and honor your commitments.

00:42:51.301 --> 00:42:52.540
We mentors can stay up

00:42:52.540 --> 00:42:53.501
waiting for your report.

00:42:54.861 --> 00:42:55.580
And clients?

00:43:01.220 --> 00:43:01.941
I understand.

00:43:15.475 --> 00:43:16.736
(Can cartoon images count as portraits?)

00:43:16.736 --> 00:43:18.656
(The core of portrait rights
is "recognizability",)

00:43:18.656 --> 00:43:19.744
(so if traits or captions)

00:43:19.744 --> 00:43:21.674
(make the person identifiable,)

00:43:21.674 --> 00:43:23.392
(the cartoon qualifies as a portrait.)

00:43:23.392 --> 00:43:24.552
(Besides real photos or videos,)

00:43:24.552 --> 00:43:26.400
(cartoons, sketches, Al-morphed faces
and deepfakes can count as portraits.)
