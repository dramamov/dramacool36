[Episode 4]
[Secrets in the Statue, The Three Powers Emerge]

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:12.470
This is Zhang Youjiao from the rural ghetto.

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.430
If you have questions,

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.990
ask him.

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:17.060
Zhang Youjiao,

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.830
have you seen a bear or a tiger lately?

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:20.540
Yes.

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.180
There was a white-fronted tiger with fierce eyes

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:24.950
who kept hurting people in the mountains last year.

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.510
Hunter Zhao encountered the tiger

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:28.540
and killed it.

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:29.740
Where's the remains of the tiger?

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.620
Well, the tiger's length was close to a man's height.

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.480
Hunter Zhao couldn't move the tiger himself,

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.970
so he asked a few hunters to help out.

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.100
We lifted the tiger with thick sticks

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.910
and managed to bring it down.

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:42.950
Hunter Zhao gave us

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:43.790
a decent amount of tiger meat afterward.

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.220
Do you know where Hunter Zhao lives?

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.700
Yes.

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:46.870
Lead the way. Let's go.

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:47.580
Please.

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.950
Isn't Xichuan supposed to be rich?

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.220
The rich people live in the inner city.

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.020
Residents here

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:12.700
cannot move to the inner city.

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:14.220
Frankly,

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:15.390
these people

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.390
are the city wall of Xichuan.

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.580
Does that mean

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:22.060
that if there's an invasion,

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:24.430
they'll take the hit first?

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.700
They are here for the Star Gold.

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:27.700
For windfalls.

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:29.310
That doesn't always pan out.

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:31.270
Those who failed to get rich

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:33.930
would have to come here and live in the ghetto.

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:34.980
I'll start boiling the medicine now.

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:35.800
Okay.

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.920
Poverty is not the main issue here.

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:42.060
The biggest issue

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.390
is that everyone here is suffering from sores.

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:45.660
No medicine is working for them,

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:47.510
and death is only fate for them.

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:59.270
Zhao, are you home?

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:00.310
Come inside.

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:02.180
Zhao,

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:04.510
these nobles from the Ma Gang

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.390
want to ask you about the white tiger you killed.

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:09.670
What do you guys want to know?

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:10.750
Ask away.

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:11.750
Hunter Zhao.

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:13.020
Let me ask you.

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:15.590
Where's the tiger you killed last year?

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:16.730
The meat became food.

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:17.910
As for the bones,

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:18.940
I heard that they can be used as medicines,

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:21.990
so I sold them to Zhang Mazi's plaster shop.

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:24.670
He said the Hua Tuo Tiger Bone Paste

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.460
made from that thing

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:29.360
can nourish the kidneys, and the waist and cure diseases.

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.270
If you don't believe me,

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:33.170
you can go ask him.

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.270
What I said is true.

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:37.300
Where did you go tonight?

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:38.510
I didn't go out.

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:40.990
I've been drinking here all along.

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.790
You didn't go to see the Nuo opera by the lake?

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:46.070
I don't believe in those things.

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:52.100
Okay.

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.940
Let's go.

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:58.600
Gentlemen.

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:00.000
If there's nothing else,

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:01.040
I'll take my leave.

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:03.560
Mr. Zhang.

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.350
Do you know where Zhang Mazi is?

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:06.440
Yes.

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:08.070
Please show us the way.

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:09.510
Okay. This way.

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:20.350
Mr. Xubu. Gentlemen.

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:22.480
Why are you coming to see me so late?

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:23.550
Something wrong?

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:25.160
You're Zhang Mazi?

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:26.310
Yes.

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:27.600
And you sell the tiger bone paste?

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:28.480
Yes.

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:29.770
Many of the Ma Gang

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:31.110
have used

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:32.520
the Hua Tuo Tiger Bone Paste I made,

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:33.670
and they all praised it.

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:34.640
Is that so?

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:35.960
In that case,

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:37.750
take out the tiger bones and let me see.

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:40.160
Mr. Xubu.

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:41.840
That thing smells very bad.

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.160
I'm afraid you can't stand it.

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:44.040
It's better not to see it.

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:45.110
Shut your mouth.

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:46.350
Show it!

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:47.960
Alright.

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:50.160
Mr. Xubu.

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:51.200
That thing

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:51.990
is very valuable.

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:53.990
Let me think.

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:58.160
Oh, right.

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:00.430
I put it in the house.

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:02.400
Mr. Xubu, a moment.

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:03.550
He is about to run.

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:06.520
After him!

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:18.600
Well...

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:20.430
Let's go then.

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:22.230
Stop!

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:23.350
- Stop! - Stop!

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:24.790
Stop there!

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:26.480
Stop!

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:27.280
Stop!

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:28.200
Stop.

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:32.600
- Stop right there! - Stop!

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:53.550
Old brat.

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:55.600
Tell me.

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:56.870
Why are you running?

00:06:57.750 --> 00:06:58.550
Mr. Xubu.

00:06:58.720 --> 00:06:59.460
I...

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.310
Don't you want to see tiger bones?

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:02.110
I was thinking

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:03.400
about going back to get it for you.

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:05.230
If you don't want to run,

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:06.230
why fix your shoes?

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:08.040
I'm afraid you will wait for long.

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:09.670
I thought running

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:10.800
is faster.

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:14.340
Too much nonsense!

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:16.310
The murderer has been caught.

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:17.310
Take him.

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:19.040
Mr. Xubu.

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:20.280
You got me wrong.

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:21.550
I'm not a murderer.

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:23.230
Absconding. More serious.

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:24.200
Mr. Xubu.

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:25.520
I really didn't kill anyone.

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:26.400
I ran away

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:27.960
for the tiger bones I sold were fake.

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:29.670
I thought you had found that

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:31.430
and were going to punish me, so I ran.

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:32.480
Shut his mouth.

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:33.960
Take him back to jail.

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:34.600
Okay.

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:35.600
Xubu Huai.

00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:39.280
I understand now.

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:40.720
You're looking for a scapegoat.

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:42.750
I'll hunt you down.

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:48.760
Mr. Xubu.

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:49.990
Calm down.

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:51.570
I think something he said

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:52.750
was true.

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:54.150
Let me ask.

00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:55.690
He runs when I talk about the bones.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:56.880
It must be him.

00:07:58.440 --> 00:07:59.810
Let me question him first.

00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:00.810
If it's really him,

00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:02.370
it won't be late to catch him then.

00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:04.370
Fu Sheng is right.

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:15.880
Sir.

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:16.960
Thank you for speaking up

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:17.810
for me.

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:19.960
Then, Zhang Mazi.

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:20.880
Tell me.

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:22.560
Why did you run?

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:23.810
I told you guys

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:25.400
Because the tiger bones I sell

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:26.290
are all fake,

00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:27.810
they are all made from dog bones.

00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:28.640
I sell them to Ma Gang...

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:29.760
Alright, alright.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:30.850
Listen.

00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:33.250
I'm saving you.

you got the tiger bones from Hunter Zhao last year.

Oh, yes, I did.

But I didn't use it.

I sold it.

What he usually sells

00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:38.960
is not tiger bone paste,

Maybe

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:04.810
Zhang Mazi lost it when reselling it.

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:06.570
This

00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:08.760
has nothing to do with me.

00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:10.850
You are right.

00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:13.730
But the key

00:14:15.490 --> 00:14:17.080
lies in this cabinet in your house.

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:28.080
Help me.

00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:36.480
I found this leather glove

00:14:36.770 --> 00:14:38.120
in your cabinet.

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:40.330
There is some white powder on it.

00:14:41.170 --> 00:14:42.050
I guess

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:44.450
it is the leftovers from your grinding of tiger bones.

00:14:45.410 --> 00:14:46.720
There are some similar powders

00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:48.290
on this arrow.

00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:50.170
If I am not mistaken,

00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:52.880
this is an arrow made of tiger bones.

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:55.000
Now that

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:56.050
the evidence

00:14:56.290 --> 00:14:57.120
is here,

00:14:57.810 --> 00:14:58.810

00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:07.160
Good!

00:15:08.410 --> 00:15:09.590
In that case,

00:15:11.410 --> 00:15:13.080
I am not afraid to tell you

00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:15.330

00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:18.400

I killed him

00:15:19.470 --> 00:15:20.770
because he deserved to die.

But I regret it now.

00:15:23.690 --> 00:15:24.880
I regret that

Stop pretending.

00:15:35.830 --> 00:15:37.100
Don't you know?

00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:39.270
It's all your Ma Gang's fault

00:15:40.190 --> 00:15:41.350
that the plague devil was born

in this lake,

00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:46.110
and the lake water has become poisonous.

00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:47.220
There is

00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:50.150
no other drinking water nearby,

00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:52.700
so we can only drink the poisonous water.

00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:55.700
We ask Fangxiang to drive away the devil every year,

00:15:55.940 --> 00:15:57.150
but what about my family?

00:15:58.670 --> 00:16:01.180
They have already died of poison!

00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:04.790
Now

00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:08.540
and won't live long.

00:16:09.510 --> 00:16:10.750
Did he drive away the devil?

00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:13.390
Since he can't drive away the plague devil,

00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:15.670
and can't save the lives of my family,

00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:19.420
I might as well

00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:22.820
take him with me.

00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:31.340
What a pity.

00:16:32.510 --> 00:16:33.910
I thought

00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:36.940
no one would know

00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:38.420
if I used bone arrows to kill.

00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:40.940
But I didn't expect

00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:44.220
you'd see right through it.

00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:45.700
It's you!

00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:49.910
You...

00:16:52.510 --> 00:16:53.390

00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:01.490
What trick did you just play?

00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:02.870
It's not a trick.

00:17:03.150 --> 00:17:04.510
That's shadow puppetry.

00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:06.460
Even the emperor enjoys it.

00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:11.110
You are really amazing.

A shadow made him confess everything.

00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:14.740
As the saying goes,

A clear conscience

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:17.630

This shadow shouldn't scare you.

00:17:20.070 --> 00:17:20.870
That's right.

Take it.

I believe trouble clings to you.

00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:50.100
In that case,

00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:52.030
we can be saved.

00:27:52.340 --> 00:27:53.190
Right!

00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:54.580
Miracle physician.

00:27:54.610 --> 00:27:55.680
Living Bodhisattva.

00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:57.290
Miracle physician.

00:27:57.290 --> 00:27:58.380
Save our lives.

00:27:58.520 --> 00:27:59.370
Fellows.

00:27:59.630 --> 00:28:00.570
You don't have to do this.

00:28:00.620 --> 00:28:01.380
Rise up.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:03.240
I will do my best to save you all.

00:28:04.090 --> 00:28:06.270
Thank you, miracle physician!

00:28:06.270 --> 00:28:07.220
Thanks.

00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:08.130
Thank you.

00:28:08.130 --> 00:28:09.510
We're counting on you.

00:28:09.510 --> 00:28:10.540
You're our lifeline.

00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:12.670
Hunter Zhao, are you insane?

00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:14.440
- Stop! - He's gone mad.

00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:15.350
What?

00:28:15.910 --> 00:28:17.260
You are afraid that doing this

00:28:17.710 --> 00:28:19.300
will desecrate the gods, right?

00:28:20.910 --> 00:28:22.300
Have you all forgotten?

00:28:22.710 --> 00:28:23.910
How many people

00:28:24.260 --> 00:28:25.910
have been poisoned by this statue?

00:28:26.670 --> 00:28:28.060
Do you have to leave it

00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:29.430
to kill more people?

00:28:30.670 --> 00:28:32.110
Wake up.

00:28:32.780 --> 00:28:33.590
Today.

00:28:35.260 --> 00:28:36.740
If it weren't for this miracle physician,

00:28:37.670 --> 00:28:39.350
who knows how many people would have died.

00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:41.150
Yeah, you're right.

00:28:41.870 --> 00:28:43.110
We can't keep this statue.

00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:44.020
We can't.

00:28:44.020 --> 00:28:45.190
It is a disaster.

00:28:45.190 --> 00:28:46.110
Let's push it down!

00:28:46.110 --> 00:28:46.910
Yes!

00:28:48.670 --> 00:28:49.390
Push it!

Fellows.

00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:27.600
The water must be boiled before drinking,

00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:28.670
or you'll have loose bowels.

00:29:29.230 --> 00:29:30.710
Don't stay in the water for too long,

00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:31.520
or you'll catch a cold.

00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:32.840
Leave them.

00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:34.120
They are just too happy.

00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:39.620
The Chamber of Commerce is here.

00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:41.190
Run!

00:29:44.390 --> 00:29:45.520
Let's go.

00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:46.960
Let's go.

00:30:12.710 --> 00:30:13.620
Chairman, god bless you.

00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:18.670
Who is this guy? Such a grand presence.

00:30:20.150 --> 00:30:21.530
The chairman of Jibei Chamber of Commerce,

00:30:21.950 --> 00:30:23.040
Song Jingye.

00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:25.800
He is Song Jingye?

00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:31.190
Well, well.

00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:32.730
Chairman Song,

00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:35.790
What brought you here?

00:30:36.140 --> 00:30:37.100
I should have gone to greet.

00:30:37.710 --> 00:30:38.510
Sorry.

00:30:39.710 --> 00:30:40.510
What brought us here?

00:30:41.230 --> 00:30:43.660
Of course it's you, Ma Gang.

00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:45.230
I'm not talking to you.

00:30:45.790 --> 00:30:47.380
Where's your leader, Che Hujue?

00:30:47.620 --> 00:30:49.310
Of course, he's in the city.

00:30:50.070 --> 00:30:52.060
You knew it. Why do you ask?

00:30:53.310 --> 00:30:54.100
Chairman.

00:30:55.230 --> 00:30:57.670
You brought so many people to my place,

00:30:58.470 --> 00:30:59.270
what do you mean?

00:31:03.670 --> 00:31:05.650
Is this the person who solved the water poison?

00:31:07.380 --> 00:31:09.470
The so-called poison in Xiangshui Lake

00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:10.790
is just a cover-up.

00:31:11.450 --> 00:31:13.050
Now that this cover has been exposed,

00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:15.530
is the Chairman very disappointed?

00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:16.960
What do you mean?

00:31:17.490 --> 00:31:19.090
What does this have to do with the Chairman?

00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:21.250
Instead, you Ma Gang

00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:22.720
smashed the statue.

00:31:23.490 --> 00:31:25.160
Aren't you afraid of being haunted by the plague devil?

00:31:25.530 --> 00:31:27.400
Vice Chairman was so anxious to interrupt,

00:31:28.250 --> 00:31:30.120
maybe you had already known the water was not poisonous,

00:31:30.290 --> 00:31:31.850
and the poison was in the statue?

00:31:33.530 --> 00:31:34.460
Could it be that

00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:37.210
Vice Chairman had someone apply this poisonous paint?

00:31:37.660 --> 00:31:38.550
Xubu Huai.

00:31:38.980 --> 00:31:40.210
You have no evidence,

00:31:40.330 --> 00:31:41.770
so stop slandering me here.

00:31:41.850 --> 00:31:43.380
I slander you?

00:31:44.530 --> 00:31:45.810
You really think no one knows

00:31:45.810 --> 00:31:46.810
what your Chamber of Commerce did?

00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:50.810
When you couldn't get the water source,

00:31:50.970 --> 00:31:52.570
you came up with this dirty trick.

00:31:52.860 --> 00:31:54.100
You painted the statue with poison paint

00:31:54.100 --> 00:31:55.100
and poisoned the people

00:31:55.100 --> 00:31:56.490
just to force us away

00:31:56.490 --> 00:31:58.380
so that you can monopolize the mining rights of the Star Gold.

00:31:58.380 --> 00:31:59.940
Do you dare to admit it?

00:32:02.660 --> 00:32:04.050
Xubu Huai said

00:32:04.050 --> 00:32:05.530
the water source?

00:32:05.530 --> 00:32:06.380
What does it mean?

00:32:09.530 --> 00:32:10.730
It all started

00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:12.810
when the two gangs were fighting.

00:32:15.970 --> 00:32:17.050
Everyone knows

00:32:17.290 --> 00:32:19.110
the mine outside Xichuan City

00:32:19.110 --> 00:32:21.770
is rich in a kind of precious mineral

00:32:22.490 --> 00:32:23.420
called Star Gold.

00:32:24.250 --> 00:32:25.180
Ma Gang and the Chamber of Commerce

00:32:25.180 --> 00:32:27.180
were attracted here by the gold.

00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:28.620
In order to mine, the two gangs

00:32:28.660 --> 00:32:30.660
were stationed on both sides of the mine

00:32:31.530 --> 00:32:33.570
and shared the Xiangshui Lake.

00:32:34.340 --> 00:32:36.010
But, over time,

00:32:36.490 --> 00:32:38.770
the friction between the two gangs continued to intensify,

00:32:39.100 --> 00:32:39.860
and finally

00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:42.530
a battle for water sources broke out.

00:32:47.860 --> 00:32:48.700
Ma Gang

00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:50.180
won a great victory in that battle.

00:32:50.860 --> 00:32:52.140
When cleaning the battlefield,

00:32:52.420 --> 00:32:54.660
Ma Gang buried their men,

00:32:55.050 --> 00:32:56.420
and in order to intimidate the chamber,

00:32:56.420 --> 00:32:58.100
they piled up all the bodies

00:32:58.290 --> 00:32:59.570
of the Chamber of Commerce by the lake,

00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:01.530
forming a mountain of corpses.

00:33:02.140 --> 00:33:03.770
That's too much.

00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:06.420
The mountain of corpses was piled there for days,

00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:08.360
and the residents did not dare to fetch water.

00:33:08.970 --> 00:33:10.240
Everyone was complaining,

00:33:10.340 --> 00:33:11.130
wondering how long

00:33:11.130 --> 00:33:13.080
Ma Gang would leave the bodies there.

00:33:13.970 --> 00:33:14.490
Leader.

00:33:14.810 --> 00:33:17.360
When are we going to remove these bodies?

00:33:17.610 --> 00:33:19.240
Every time our men walk past here,

00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:20.940
they cough so hard they almost throw up.

00:33:20.940 --> 00:33:22.700
The smell is unbearable.

00:33:23.140 --> 00:33:24.340
The people living nearby

00:33:24.340 --> 00:33:25.940
don't dare to come here to get water.

00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:28.250
They often come to our door to make trouble.

00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:29.010
Let them make.

00:33:29.940 --> 00:33:31.660
When they are too thirsty to survive,

00:33:32.100 --> 00:33:33.820
they will come to fetch water

00:33:34.180 --> 00:33:35.660
whether there are bodies or not.

00:33:36.490 --> 00:33:38.260
Two days passed,

00:33:38.460 --> 00:33:40.260
the residents who really had no water

00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:41.690
decided to go get some water.

00:33:42.770 --> 00:33:43.900
When they came to the lake,

00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:45.290
they found that the mountain of bodies had gone,

00:33:45.940 --> 00:33:47.050
and instead,

00:33:47.290 --> 00:33:49.100
there were bodies floating all over the lake.

00:33:50.420 --> 00:33:51.420
It suddenly

00:33:51.940 --> 00:33:53.180
started to rain from that day on,

00:34:00.180 --> 00:34:01.980
and it rained heavily for several days,

00:34:02.180 --> 00:34:04.080
and it looked like a flood was about to happen.

00:34:04.660 --> 00:34:06.260
The people said

00:34:06.970 --> 00:34:08.300
it must be the Ma Gang,

00:34:08.460 --> 00:34:10.170
which aggravated the resentment here

00:34:10.260 --> 00:34:11.740
and gave birth to the plague devil.

00:34:12.130 --> 00:34:13.380
It is said that the plague devil

00:34:13.380 --> 00:34:15.490
often appears in the waters of rivers and lakes,

00:34:15.860 --> 00:34:16.860
spreading plague

00:34:17.090 --> 00:34:18.300
and bringing disasters.

00:34:18.570 --> 00:34:20.650
As long as bad guys take advantage of it,

00:34:21.260 --> 00:34:23.420
I'm afraid this rumor can spread like wildfire.

00:34:25.190 --> 00:34:26.230
You're right.

00:34:26.230 --> 00:34:28.830
This rumor soon reached Ma Gang.

00:34:28.940 --> 00:34:29.820
They also began

00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:31.380
to be afraid.

00:34:32.740 --> 00:34:34.740
They invited a strange man

00:34:35.050 --> 00:34:37.170
who claimed to be able to connect with the will of Fangxiang.

00:34:37.650 --> 00:34:40.780
Only by using the power of Fangxiang to suppress the evil

00:34:41.170 --> 00:34:42.900
could the rain be stopped.

00:34:43.220 --> 00:34:45.460
Ma Gang also erected a statue of Fangxiang

00:34:45.490 --> 00:34:47.420
at the location of the original body mountain.

00:34:47.570 --> 00:34:48.820
Miraculously,

00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:50.690
with the suppression of the Fangxiang statue,

00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:51.630
the rain

00:34:52.200 --> 00:34:52.920
actually stopped.

00:34:54.690 --> 00:34:57.150
Ma Gang believed in this strange man

00:34:57.840 --> 00:35:00.550
and invited him to perform the Nuo dance every year to eliminate disasters.

00:35:01.110 --> 00:35:02.030
He also ordered Ma Gang

00:35:02.030 --> 00:35:04.240
to repaint the statue with red paint

00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:07.070
and opened a pool in front of the statue,

00:35:07.550 --> 00:35:09.920
saying that rain is rootless water.

00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:11.800
In the future, when it rains again,

00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:13.510
the rain will hit the statue

00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:15.840
and it will be purified and blessed.

00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:18.440
The people can wash their faces with rainwater in the pool

00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:20.110
to remove bad luck.

00:35:24.630 --> 00:35:25.470
Then what?

00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:26.880
Then,

00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:30.200
the plague devil seemed to live in Xiangshui Lake.

00:35:30.510 --> 00:35:32.200
From then on, the lake water became poisonous,

00:35:32.510 --> 00:35:34.150
and drinking it would cause poisoning.

00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:35.670
Actually,

00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:37.280
the residents are just

00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:39.280
victims of this dispute.

00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:42.450
They have done nothing wrong,

00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:44.400
they just want to live.

00:35:46.630 --> 00:35:48.270
If I'm not mistaken,

00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:51.670
you also sent Fangxiang here.

00:35:52.140 --> 00:35:54.670
You send men to paint the statue with poison paint every year,

00:35:55.420 --> 00:35:57.490
isn't it just to deepen their resentment

00:35:57.490 --> 00:35:59.320
towards us?

00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:00.840
Xubu Huai.

00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:02.720
You keep talking nonsense.

00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:04.900
Do you want to start a war?

00:36:05.090 --> 00:36:06.900
Let's fight. I'm not afraid of you.

00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:07.660
Guys!

00:36:07.780 --> 00:36:09.050
