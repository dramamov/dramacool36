(Talent Hunt Program Day 8)

00:01:50.115 --> 00:01:52.155
(Huang Yue 4, Li Ke 4,
Yan Fei 4, Wang Lu 3)

00:01:52.155 --> 00:01:53.960
(Guo Xiaoyu 2,
Ren Jiatong 1, Jiang Chen 1)

00:01:54.268 --> 00:01:55.908
Mom, three more months, okay?

00:01:57.147 --> 00:01:59.188
I'll win first place
in the Talent Hunt Program.

00:01:59.867 --> 00:02:01.668
I don't need to inherit anything.

00:02:01.988 --> 00:02:02.867
Think about it.

00:02:03.188 --> 00:02:04.787
What if you don't make it to the end?

00:02:17.307 --> 00:02:18.307
Life is unbearable

00:02:18.907 --> 00:02:19.988
after retirement.

00:02:20.348 --> 00:02:21.627
I have nothing to do.

00:02:22.508 --> 00:02:23.907
So I came up with an idea.

00:02:23.907 --> 00:02:25.348
I started writing down

00:02:25.587 --> 00:02:27.388
my childhood memories, work stories,

00:02:27.388 --> 00:02:28.427
and all sorts of things

00:02:28.548 --> 00:02:29.828
into a novel.

00:02:36.828 --> 00:02:38.988
Zhou Nian, be serious
about what I told you.

00:02:39.508 --> 00:02:40.268
Get started.

00:02:40.587 --> 00:02:40.907
Got it.

00:02:41.348 --> 00:02:42.027
Take action.

00:02:42.907 --> 00:02:43.867
Ting, get in the car.

00:02:47.988 --> 00:02:48.948
Drive safely, sir.

00:02:49.388 --> 00:02:49.800
Alright.

00:03:08.027 --> 00:03:09.348
Where are you headed? Hop in.

00:03:10.788 --> 00:03:11.707
We're both here

00:03:12.268 --> 00:03:14.228
being forced into marriage.

00:03:18.948 --> 00:03:19.548
Get in.

00:03:27.427 --> 00:03:27.788
Miss,

00:03:28.187 --> 00:03:28.867
I'm home now.

00:03:28.948 --> 00:03:30.027
Thank you so much.

00:03:30.027 --> 00:03:31.147
Let me carry this up.

00:03:31.307 --> 00:03:31.988
No need.

00:03:32.268 --> 00:03:33.108
You've carried it

00:03:33.108 --> 00:03:34.388
for me all the way.

00:03:34.508 --> 00:03:35.508
Thank you so much.

00:03:35.907 --> 00:03:36.948
It was nothing.

00:03:37.348 --> 00:03:38.027
By the way, sir.

00:03:38.147 --> 00:03:40.668
Are you in a rush
about the screenwriter consultation?

00:03:40.988 --> 00:03:43.027
I just remembered
I have a screenwriter friend.

00:03:43.108 --> 00:03:44.228
Want me to connect you?

00:03:44.907 --> 00:03:46.348
Didn't I tell you?

00:03:46.788 --> 00:03:47.828
After retiring,

00:03:47.828 --> 00:03:50.627
I spent years writing this novel.

00:03:50.828 --> 00:03:53.187
Then I adapted it into a movie script.

00:03:53.707 --> 00:03:54.587
I submitted it

00:03:54.587 --> 00:03:56.627
and waited endlessly for responses

00:03:57.187 --> 00:03:58.108
that never came.

00:04:00.108 --> 00:04:01.108
Then my grandson

00:04:01.187 --> 00:04:03.627
took me to a new movie one day.

00:04:04.268 --> 00:04:05.348
I watched it.

00:04:05.747 --> 00:04:06.348
You know what?

00:04:06.747 --> 00:04:07.788
The plot was

00:04:07.788 --> 00:04:09.668
identical to my script.

00:04:11.147 --> 00:04:12.548
It's been bothering me

00:04:12.747 --> 00:04:14.307
for days.

00:04:14.988 --> 00:04:16.228
Are you suggesting

00:04:16.507 --> 00:04:18.867
they might have
infringed on your copyright?

00:04:20.187 --> 00:04:20.908
Don't worry.

00:04:20.908 --> 00:04:22.067
Though I can't personally

00:04:22.067 --> 00:04:23.187
help with your lawsuit,

00:04:23.187 --> 00:04:25.228
I'll connect you with Jun An's lawyers.

00:04:26.548 --> 00:04:27.468
A lawsuit?

00:04:28.108 --> 00:04:29.908
I need to think about this.

00:04:31.028 --> 00:04:31.387
Alright.

00:04:31.747 --> 00:04:33.187
Let's exchange WeChat contacts.

00:04:33.387 --> 00:04:34.908
Feel free to text me

00:04:34.908 --> 00:04:35.788
when you need help.

00:04:35.827 --> 00:04:36.348
Alright.

00:04:36.548 --> 00:04:36.867
Okay.

00:04:38.908 --> 00:04:39.228
Done.

00:04:40.988 --> 00:04:42.668
I'll head up now. Thank you.

00:04:43.067 --> 00:04:43.507
Thanks.

00:04:43.507 --> 00:04:44.228
- Bye, sir.
- Thanks.

00:04:44.348 --> 00:04:45.028
Thank you.

00:04:47.708 --> 00:04:49.468
I've only seen
this car's interior online.

00:04:50.228 --> 00:04:50.988
It's my first ride.

00:04:51.387 --> 00:04:51.747
So nice.

00:04:52.148 --> 00:04:53.307
Stop being so dramatic.

00:04:53.788 --> 00:04:56.187
A fourth-year lawyer
at Jun An earns decent money.

00:04:56.988 --> 00:04:57.827
Forced marriage?

00:04:58.028 --> 00:04:59.867
Just grit your teeth and accept it.

00:05:00.348 --> 00:05:01.908
You seem to like that lady, nodding

00:05:01.908 --> 00:05:02.867
at everything she says.

00:05:03.228 --> 00:05:04.387
Of course I like her,

00:05:04.908 --> 00:05:06.108
but marriage is different.

00:05:07.387 --> 00:05:08.788
Our situations differ, though.

00:05:09.307 --> 00:05:10.827
You're having a marriage alliance.

00:05:11.028 --> 00:05:12.267
I'm merely struggling.

00:05:13.588 --> 00:05:14.427
To get married,

00:05:14.788 --> 00:05:16.067
my parents sold their house.

00:05:16.307 --> 00:05:17.827
We pooled money for a down payment

00:05:17.827 --> 00:05:19.267
and got a bigger place in Daxing.

00:05:19.668 --> 00:05:20.867
But she wants another house

00:05:21.548 --> 00:05:22.267
because she can't

00:05:22.668 --> 00:05:23.827
live with my parents.

00:05:26.267 --> 00:05:28.028
So both families' burdens

00:05:28.028 --> 00:05:29.267
fall on your shoulders?

00:05:29.947 --> 00:05:31.867
No wonder you mentor us
while you're so busy.

00:05:33.427 --> 00:05:33.947
I'll buy it

00:05:34.468 --> 00:05:35.468
just to get married.

00:05:36.627 --> 00:05:38.148
I didn't see or hear

00:05:38.348 --> 00:05:39.108
anything.

00:05:39.427 --> 00:05:39.827
Thank you.

00:05:40.708 --> 00:05:41.148
Where to?

00:05:41.827 --> 00:05:43.588
I'll get back to work for buying house.

00:05:45.028 --> 00:05:45.588
Impressive.

00:05:48.427 --> 00:05:49.267
(Jun An's free legal consultation)
Let me look into it.

00:05:49.387 --> 00:05:50.548
Just call me anytime.

00:05:50.747 --> 00:05:51.108
Alright.

00:05:54.267 --> 00:05:55.867
We're not licensed lawyers yet.

00:05:55.867 --> 00:05:57.348
And Jun An gets enough cases.

00:05:57.427 --> 00:05:59.148
Why are you snatching clients?

00:05:59.387 --> 00:06:00.067
Beibei.

00:06:01.067 --> 00:06:02.348
Beibei, where are you?

00:06:04.468 --> 00:06:06.708
I'll let you play
the Good Samaritan this time.

00:06:07.668 --> 00:06:08.067
Sure.

00:06:08.627 --> 00:06:09.228
Ma'am.

00:06:11.067 --> 00:06:11.507
Miss.

00:06:12.387 --> 00:06:14.148
Can you help my daughter?

00:06:14.627 --> 00:06:15.208
Your daughter?

00:06:17.028 --> 00:06:18.028
Ma'am, calm down.

00:06:18.307 --> 00:06:20.427
My colleague graduated
from a top foreign university.

00:06:20.548 --> 00:06:21.348
He's amazing.

00:06:21.348 --> 00:06:22.507
Tell him what you need.

00:06:22.507 --> 00:06:23.788
Come on, how's that relevant?

00:06:23.788 --> 00:06:24.427
What happened?

00:06:24.708 --> 00:06:26.348
My daughter is missing.

00:06:26.548 --> 00:06:27.187
How old is she?

00:06:32.348 --> 00:06:33.348
This is your daughter?

00:06:34.627 --> 00:06:37.187
My Beibei.

00:06:37.387 --> 00:06:38.348
Don't be afraid.

00:06:39.348 --> 00:06:39.708
Let's go.

00:06:41.348 --> 00:06:41.788
Ma'am.

00:06:42.348 --> 00:06:42.947
This is Beibei?

00:06:43.668 --> 00:06:45.028
This is her. My daughter.

00:06:48.588 --> 00:06:49.348
Thank you.

00:06:49.588 --> 00:06:50.028
No problem.

00:06:50.028 --> 00:06:51.148
You're so kind.

00:06:51.148 --> 00:06:51.908
Now I'm relieved.

00:06:52.387 --> 00:06:53.548
My Beibei.

00:06:54.668 --> 00:06:56.747
Don't you run off again.

00:06:57.427 --> 00:06:58.067
Young man.

00:06:58.468 --> 00:07:00.627
Could you also look after my baby?

00:07:00.627 --> 00:07:01.387
Your baby is...

00:07:01.827 --> 00:07:02.387
That's it.

00:07:02.588 --> 00:07:03.708
This is your baby?

00:07:03.827 --> 00:07:04.148
Yeah.

00:07:04.228 --> 00:07:04.867
No.

00:07:04.867 --> 00:07:06.627
Not a dog. I'm allergic, Ma'am.

00:07:07.187 --> 00:07:08.548
I'm sorry.

00:07:08.588 --> 00:07:09.267
Just help out.

00:07:09.267 --> 00:07:10.468
I can't, Ma'am.

00:07:10.627 --> 00:07:11.747
Don't run off, young man.

00:07:11.747 --> 00:07:12.827
Don't let it chase me.

00:07:12.827 --> 00:07:13.827
- Help out.
- Please.

00:07:13.947 --> 00:07:15.387
It's not that I don't want to help.

00:07:15.708 --> 00:07:16.468
Why don't you

00:07:16.468 --> 00:07:18.548
just find someone else, Ma'am?

00:07:18.827 --> 00:07:19.867
Please help me.

00:07:21.187 --> 00:07:22.148
Stop chasing me.

00:07:24.933 --> 00:07:28.104
(Bai Xiao: Redo it!)

00:07:46.348 --> 00:07:46.708
Hello.

00:07:47.307 --> 00:07:49.947
Do you remember that uncle we met
at the legal consultation?

00:07:50.028 --> 00:07:51.627
He said he couldn't reach you.

00:07:52.548 --> 00:07:53.267
I have

00:07:53.267 --> 00:07:54.627
an urgent task at hand.

00:07:54.627 --> 00:07:55.747
Could you check with him?

00:07:57.148 --> 00:07:57.640
It's tricky.

00:07:59.307 --> 00:08:01.348
We actually spoke briefly.

00:08:01.348 --> 00:08:03.067
I told him that the lawsuit doesn't meet

00:08:03.067 --> 00:08:04.148
the access requirements.

00:08:04.627 --> 00:08:05.187
We can't win.

00:08:05.387 --> 00:08:06.228
Then he

00:08:06.908 --> 00:08:07.588
got mad at me.

00:08:07.988 --> 00:08:09.307
Anyone would get angry.

00:08:09.427 --> 00:08:10.548
I think we should

00:08:10.548 --> 00:08:12.827
first empathize with him

00:08:12.827 --> 00:08:14.307
and then offer solutions.

00:08:14.827 --> 00:08:16.187
He's an elderly man

00:08:16.187 --> 00:08:17.827
who doesn't know much about the law.

00:08:18.148 --> 00:08:19.228
He struggled all day

00:08:19.228 --> 00:08:20.988
and mustered the courage
to ask for help.

00:08:21.387 --> 00:08:22.627
You told him it won't work.

00:08:22.947 --> 00:08:24.067
Who wouldn't be upset?

00:08:24.348 --> 00:08:25.468
I do understand him.

00:08:26.548 --> 00:08:27.827
But his novel,

00:08:27.827 --> 00:08:29.788
or script, was never published.

00:08:30.307 --> 00:08:31.468
What can I do?

00:08:33.027 --> 00:08:34.627
You can check the documentation.

00:08:34.828 --> 00:08:36.667
In China's judicial practice,

00:08:36.988 --> 00:08:38.787
the plaintiff's
burden of proof for access

00:08:38.828 --> 00:08:40.027
doesn't require absolute proof

00:08:40.188 --> 00:08:41.228
that the defendant had

00:08:41.228 --> 00:08:43.267
complete access to the plaintiff's work.

00:08:43.308 --> 00:08:45.547
They just need to prove
that the defendant had

00:08:45.627 --> 00:08:46.667
or could have accessed

00:08:46.667 --> 00:08:48.387
the plaintiff's work.

00:08:48.747 --> 00:08:50.027
Fine, even if that's the case,

00:08:51.228 --> 00:08:53.348
when the court proceedings
actually begin,

00:08:53.708 --> 00:08:54.867
what if you can't prove

00:08:54.948 --> 00:08:57.588
that the director
or screenwriter ever accessed

00:08:58.068 --> 00:08:58.468
his novel?

00:08:59.147 --> 00:08:59.787
First off,

00:08:59.787 --> 00:09:01.867
neither of us is qualified
to handle this case.

00:09:01.867 --> 00:09:02.667
Even if he entrusts

00:09:02.667 --> 00:09:03.988
Jun An with representation,

00:09:04.027 --> 00:09:05.627
we don't make the decision.

00:09:06.027 --> 00:09:08.027
Besides, he's an elderly man.

00:09:08.027 --> 00:09:09.867
He doesn't understand
legal technicalities.

00:09:10.188 --> 00:09:11.267
Find a way to make sure

00:09:11.267 --> 00:09:12.988
that he actually understands you.

00:09:13.588 --> 00:09:15.507
Imagine if he were your family.

00:09:15.547 --> 00:09:17.507
If you knew he couldn't understand,

00:09:17.547 --> 00:09:19.027
would you talk to him like this?

00:09:19.027 --> 00:09:21.027
Why does it matter

00:09:22.108 --> 00:09:23.387
if he's my family?

00:09:23.428 --> 00:09:25.507
I'd speak this way
to any elderly person.

00:09:25.988 --> 00:09:27.547
Seniors and children alike.

00:09:27.588 --> 00:09:28.627
We've both received

00:09:28.627 --> 00:09:30.147
proper legal education.

00:09:30.588 --> 00:09:32.867
Our first lesson
was about factual accuracy.

00:09:33.147 --> 00:09:33.547
Right?

00:09:34.348 --> 00:09:36.027
Forget it. This is pointless.

00:09:36.387 --> 00:09:37.387
I'll wait for his call.

00:09:46.408 --> 00:09:47.004
(Access requirement)

00:09:47.151 --> 00:09:50.344
(Key factor in determining copyright
infringement The accused party had)

00:09:50.344 --> 00:09:54.248
(the possibility of accessing
or had access to the original work.)

00:09:57.188 --> 00:09:57.588
Hello?

00:09:58.667 --> 00:10:00.308
Sweetie, it's Mom.

00:10:00.747 --> 00:10:01.468
Yes, darling.

00:10:01.828 --> 00:10:02.828
I am back now.

00:10:04.348 --> 00:10:06.267
But I need to stop by the office first

00:10:06.267 --> 00:10:07.547
to grab some files.

00:10:09.428 --> 00:10:11.948
Then I'll come straight home, okay?

00:10:14.907 --> 00:10:17.627
Give me a kiss. Sweetie.

00:10:18.468 --> 00:10:19.428
Alrighty then.

00:10:23.068 --> 00:10:24.072
Why are you still here?

00:10:24.627 --> 00:10:25.428
I'm redoing

00:10:25.787 --> 00:10:27.068
the report as you requested.

00:10:29.948 --> 00:10:30.627
Do you know why

00:10:30.627 --> 00:10:32.627
I kept you here
despite the Warm Nest case?

00:10:37.588 --> 00:10:40.147
I've mentored
several promising juniors before.

00:10:41.308 --> 00:10:42.667
All top law school graduates,

00:10:43.068 --> 00:10:44.627
dazzled by Jun An's prestige.

00:10:44.988 --> 00:10:47.027
They articulated during interviews.

00:10:47.147 --> 00:10:48.147
But all of them

00:10:48.147 --> 00:10:49.108
let me down in practice.

00:10:49.708 --> 00:10:51.907
Some couldn't handle the pressure

00:10:51.907 --> 00:10:52.708
and quit.

00:10:53.507 --> 00:10:55.708
You're usually quiet,

00:10:55.907 --> 00:10:57.188
but proactive in execution.

00:10:57.547 --> 00:10:59.267
When you spot opportunities,

00:10:59.267 --> 00:11:01.188
you fight relentlessly to seize them.

00:11:01.948 --> 00:11:03.188
I thought you were different.

00:11:10.627 --> 00:11:12.147
I reviewed your research report.

00:11:12.588 --> 00:11:14.387
It's crammed with legal statutes,

00:11:14.387 --> 00:11:15.787
case studies, and analysis,

00:11:16.348 --> 00:11:18.147
but lacks a definitive conclusion,

00:11:18.907 --> 00:11:20.907
the very thing I needed most.

00:11:22.108 --> 00:11:24.867
Besides, formatting is subpar.

00:11:25.228 --> 00:11:27.468
Multiple glaring typos stand out.

00:11:28.188 --> 00:11:29.547
You must understand this.

00:11:30.068 --> 00:11:31.988
Clients may not grasp

00:11:32.188 --> 00:11:35.027
the depth of your legal counsel,

00:11:35.308 --> 00:11:37.027
but they'll instantly notice

00:11:37.027 --> 00:11:38.547
every single typo.

00:11:39.267 --> 00:11:40.708
And that's sufficient reason

00:11:40.708 --> 00:11:42.907
to negate all your previous work.

00:11:44.147 --> 00:11:46.027
Client trust takes years to build,

00:11:46.188 --> 00:11:48.027
but seconds to destroy.

00:11:48.708 --> 00:11:49.747
If preventable

00:11:49.747 --> 00:11:51.267
basic mistakes

00:11:51.588 --> 00:11:53.428
cost their trust,

00:11:54.027 --> 00:11:55.188
you'll need

00:11:55.188 --> 00:11:56.867
twice the effort to recover

00:11:57.308 --> 00:11:58.267
what's lost.

00:12:02.108 --> 00:12:02.627
Ms. Bai.

00:12:04.267 --> 00:12:05.588
I really gave my all.

00:12:06.667 --> 00:12:08.667
I pulled an all-nighter for this.

00:12:09.708 --> 00:12:11.068
Want me to applaud

00:12:11.228 --> 00:12:12.468
your effort?

00:12:12.907 --> 00:12:14.428
Every lawyer works hard.

00:12:14.428 --> 00:12:15.348
Every one of them.

00:12:15.828 --> 00:12:17.627
Without desirable results,

00:12:17.627 --> 00:12:19.428
effort just becomes regret.

00:12:21.068 --> 00:12:21.747
Sorry, Ms. Bai.

00:12:22.308 --> 00:12:23.068
I failed this.

00:12:24.267 --> 00:12:25.428
But I said I'd stay,

00:12:25.787 --> 00:12:26.507
and I will.

00:12:29.547 --> 00:12:30.108
Ren Jiatong.

00:12:30.747 --> 00:12:32.027
After your bachelor's degree,

00:12:32.027 --> 00:12:33.627
you interned at other firms.

00:12:34.027 --> 00:12:36.027
Then you went for graduate studies.

00:12:36.027 --> 00:12:37.228
You know perfectly well

00:12:37.387 --> 00:12:38.228
that our profession

00:12:38.228 --> 00:12:40.147
has no shortage of hard workers.

00:12:41.108 --> 00:12:42.667
What's rare are leaders

00:12:42.828 --> 00:12:45.068
who efficiently resolve complex issues.

00:12:45.547 --> 00:12:46.547
As a lawyer,

00:12:46.828 --> 00:12:48.188
you can work alone.

00:12:48.667 --> 00:12:50.867
But if you want to advance
in our profession,

00:12:51.188 --> 00:12:52.547
to go far and stay steady,

00:12:53.027 --> 00:12:54.747
you must seek help and collaborate,

00:12:54.828 --> 00:12:56.667
as well as build and lead teams.

00:12:56.907 --> 00:12:57.588
Because someday,

00:12:57.588 --> 00:12:58.507
you might

00:12:58.507 --> 00:13:00.027
grow into a partner, right?

00:13:00.588 --> 00:13:02.428
A partner requires two key abilities.

00:13:02.428 --> 00:13:03.387
Professional expertise

00:13:03.387 --> 00:13:04.787
and team management skills.

00:13:05.787 --> 00:13:06.948
The task I assigned you

00:13:06.988 --> 00:13:08.747
isn't something you can complete alone

00:13:08.747 --> 00:13:11.468
through overtime or all-nighters.

00:13:11.747 --> 00:13:13.547
Your solo attempt only forces me

00:13:13.708 --> 00:13:16.188
to stay up fixing your mistakes.

00:13:18.468 --> 00:13:19.267
I'm sorry, Ms. Bai.

00:13:20.108 --> 00:13:20.747
Ren Jiatong,

00:13:21.188 --> 00:13:23.588
even the most diligent
and outstanding one needs allies

00:13:23.588 --> 00:13:24.308
and teammates.

00:13:24.867 --> 00:13:26.027
Stop working alone.

00:13:26.547 --> 00:13:27.708
My advice is simple.

00:13:27.708 --> 00:13:28.787
Go home and rest.

00:13:29.547 --> 00:13:30.348
Tomorrow morning,

00:13:30.507 --> 00:13:31.428
find a teammate

00:13:31.428 --> 00:13:32.708
to finish this task together.

00:13:32.867 --> 00:13:33.308
Understood?

00:13:34.667 --> 00:13:35.068
Yes.

00:13:36.787 --> 00:13:37.267
Go home.

00:13:45.428 --> 00:13:46.308
(Jiang Chen)
I asked

00:13:46.308 --> 00:13:48.027
the uncle for all his submission emails

00:13:48.348 --> 00:13:49.867
and one of them looks fishy.

00:13:56.027 --> 00:13:56.428
Hello.

00:13:59.507 --> 00:14:00.747
Want to team up on

00:14:00.747 --> 00:14:02.228
Ms. Bai's medical dispute case?

00:14:02.387 --> 00:14:02.747
Sure.

00:14:03.188 --> 00:14:04.068
But...

00:14:04.228 --> 00:14:05.068
See you tomorrow.

00:14:29.068 --> 00:14:29.708
Morning.

00:14:30.267 --> 00:14:30.787
You're early.

00:14:31.588 --> 00:14:32.988
I've sent you the files.

00:14:33.387 --> 00:14:35.240
Check them later. Ask me
if you have questions.

00:14:35.747 --> 00:14:36.068
Okay.

00:14:38.907 --> 00:14:40.267
Shouldn't you ask me questions?

00:14:40.428 --> 00:14:41.507
You came to me for help.

00:14:41.708 --> 00:14:44.308
I'll say it again. It's a collaboration.

00:15:01.338 --> 00:15:03.400
(Jiang Chen:

00:15:07.315 --> 00:15:09.064
(Medical Dispute between
Yu and A Hospital in Beijing)

00:15:14.188 --> 00:15:15.147
Any questions about

00:15:15.147 --> 00:15:16.228
Article 1225

00:15:16.348 --> 00:15:16.867
we discussed?

00:15:18.828 --> 00:15:20.627
Since mediators facilitated

00:15:20.627 --> 00:15:22.907
the mutually agreed resolution,

00:15:22.907 --> 00:15:24.188
the settlement stands.

00:15:24.747 --> 00:15:25.787
Let's proceed.

00:15:38.867 --> 00:15:40.228
The framework works,

00:15:40.267 --> 00:15:41.027
but this...

00:15:43.588 --> 00:15:44.308
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

00:15:45.468 --> 00:15:46.747
Are you new trainee lawyers?

00:15:48.428 --> 00:15:49.228
Yeah, we're...

00:15:49.787 --> 00:15:50.547
Good day.

00:15:50.547 --> 00:15:52.468
We're from the Talent Hunt Program.

00:15:52.588 --> 00:15:53.507
I'm Ren Jiatong.

00:15:53.667 --> 00:15:55.267
And I'm Jiang Chen.

00:15:55.867 --> 00:15:57.308
I've heard of Talent Hunt Program.

00:15:57.547 --> 00:15:58.428
Great opportunity.

00:15:59.108 --> 00:15:59.787
Very competitive.

00:16:00.108 --> 00:16:01.468
We survived that back then.

00:16:02.267 --> 00:16:03.147
Good luck in earning

00:16:03.147 --> 00:16:04.147
an exciting offer.

00:16:05.387 --> 00:16:05.828
Thank you.

00:16:06.147 --> 00:16:06.547
Thank you.

00:16:07.428 --> 00:16:07.867
Carry on.

00:16:19.667 --> 00:16:20.228
Dinner time.

00:16:21.267 --> 00:16:21.988
Takeout?

00:16:22.627 --> 00:16:23.147
No thanks.

00:16:24.588 --> 00:16:26.027
Even Wonder Woman needs to eat.

00:16:27.988 --> 00:16:29.787
I hate choosing takeout.

00:16:29.867 --> 00:16:30.627
Too many options.

00:16:31.267 --> 00:16:33.708
Mr. Song recommended
a great Shunde restaurant downstairs.

00:16:33.708 --> 00:16:34.667
Let's try it.

00:16:36.468 --> 00:16:40.188
Order for yourself.
I have instant noodles.

00:16:41.627 --> 00:16:43.188
At least get cup noodles.

00:16:43.188 --> 00:16:44.188
Packaged ones are messy.

00:16:45.068 --> 00:16:45.907
It tastes the same,

00:16:45.907 --> 00:16:46.787
but twice the price.

00:16:47.027 --> 00:16:48.907
For those planning to survive
the three-month

00:16:48.907 --> 00:16:50.348
Talent Hunt Program,

00:16:50.468 --> 00:16:51.988
that's bad budgeting.

00:16:52.747 --> 00:16:54.468
Did you study law or accounting?

00:16:56.627 --> 00:16:58.188
Honestly, with me around, you won't

00:16:58.867 --> 00:16:59.948
last three months.

00:17:00.547 --> 00:17:01.267
Rest assured.

00:17:01.627 --> 00:17:02.267
I will win.

00:17:05.188 --> 00:17:07.148
I admire ambitious rivals like you.

00:17:08.027 --> 00:17:08.948
Without you,

00:17:09.428 --> 00:17:11.067
this program wouldn't be so interesting.

00:17:11.708 --> 00:17:12.827
But we're the same type.

00:17:13.468 --> 00:17:14.388
We're both competitive.

00:17:14.787 --> 00:17:15.148
So,

00:17:15.708 --> 00:17:17.468
staying at Jun An is a done deal for me.

00:17:22.347 --> 00:17:23.107
I believe in you.

00:17:23.708 --> 00:17:24.547
Come back next year,

00:17:24.948 --> 00:17:25.747
and you'll make it.

00:17:26.827 --> 00:17:27.307
Jiatong.

00:17:27.908 --> 00:17:29.388
Come next year, and I'll back you up.

00:17:36.124 --> 00:17:39.496
(Jointly completed
by Ren Jiatong and Jiang Chen)

00:17:41.868 --> 00:17:42.628
Done.

00:17:43.547 --> 00:17:45.107
I'll buy you late-night snacks.

00:17:45.868 --> 00:17:47.027
Are you kidding?

00:17:47.587 --> 00:17:48.908
We just had dinner.

00:17:49.228 --> 00:17:50.988
I just had instant noodles.

00:17:53.107 --> 00:17:54.388
Didn't I tell you to order food?

00:17:54.468 --> 00:17:55.507
You stubbornly wanted

00:17:55.507 --> 00:17:57.827
to experience the life
of ordinary staff like us.

00:17:59.547 --> 00:18:00.148
My fault then.

00:18:01.547 --> 00:18:02.428
Have some milk.

00:18:04.747 --> 00:18:06.988
A kid of your age
is usually off milk by now.

00:18:08.468 --> 00:18:09.507
For protein supplement.

00:18:11.668 --> 00:18:12.067
Thanks.

00:18:12.547 --> 00:18:14.428
Packaged instant noodles won't do.

00:18:15.027 --> 00:18:16.027
Forget three months.

00:18:16.107 --> 00:18:17.468
You won't last thirty days.

00:18:21.507 --> 00:18:22.344
Don't overthink it.

00:18:22.948 --> 00:18:24.787
I'm just worried about my digestion.

00:18:25.428 --> 00:18:25.988
That's why.

00:18:27.067 --> 00:18:29.027
How did you even grow up like this?

00:18:29.067 --> 00:18:29.908
I bet your dad

00:18:29.908 --> 00:18:31.587
has tried to teach you how to speak.

00:18:36.708 --> 00:18:37.267
I'm not

00:18:38.668 --> 00:18:39.307
close to him.

00:18:40.948 --> 00:18:41.988
So that never happened.

00:18:53.827 --> 00:18:54.908
Right, the uncle

00:18:54.908 --> 00:18:56.188
sent you those emails.

00:18:56.188 --> 00:18:57.027
What did you find?

00:19:00.148 --> 00:19:00.668
Wait.

00:19:01.388 --> 00:19:01.948
Come and see.

00:19:06.827 --> 00:19:07.787
He has sent emails

00:19:07.787 --> 00:19:09.347
to many film companies

00:19:09.347 --> 00:19:10.107
in the past.

00:19:10.148 --> 00:19:11.347
One of them replied to him.

00:19:11.507 --> 00:19:11.868
Look.

00:19:12.148 --> 00:19:14.307
We will reply as soon as possible.

00:19:14.628 --> 00:19:15.267
(Script submission, "When I Was Young")
Note the signature.

00:19:16.027 --> 00:19:16.868
WD Film.

00:19:17.228 --> 00:19:18.067
WD.

00:19:18.468 --> 00:19:19.628
WD Film.

00:19:20.027 --> 00:19:22.067
Isn't it the company he wants to sue?

00:19:22.148 --> 00:19:22.948
Also, look at

00:19:23.307 --> 00:19:24.267
this email address.

00:19:24.747 --> 00:19:25.547
The first part

00:19:25.628 --> 00:19:27.708
must be a person's name.

00:19:28.307 --> 00:19:29.188
So I'm thinking.

00:19:29.628 --> 00:19:31.587
If we find this person's name

00:19:31.708 --> 00:19:33.388
in the movie credits,

00:19:33.388 --> 00:19:35.027
we might be able to prove

00:19:35.148 --> 00:19:37.347
that they had access
to that uncle's novel

00:19:37.347 --> 00:19:37.948
or script.

00:19:38.587 --> 00:19:40.148
I've glanced at that movie.

00:19:40.148 --> 00:19:41.507
The end credits include

00:19:41.507 --> 00:19:42.507
quite a few names.

00:19:42.507 --> 00:19:43.428
Let's divide the work.

00:19:43.587 --> 00:19:43.988
No need.

00:19:44.587 --> 00:19:46.628
Ms. Bai might reply at any moment.

00:19:46.787 --> 00:19:47.988
You keep an eye on the email.

00:19:47.988 --> 00:19:48.988
I'll find this person.

00:19:48.988 --> 00:19:49.747
If I find it,

00:19:49.747 --> 00:19:51.307
I'll tell you right away, okay?

00:19:59.388 --> 00:19:59.948
Jiang Chen.

00:20:01.547 --> 00:20:03.107
Last night on the phone,

00:20:03.827 --> 00:20:05.388
I said it was pointless to talk to you.

00:20:06.188 --> 00:20:07.107
I was too arbitrary.

00:20:09.868 --> 00:20:10.827
We spoke on the phone?

00:20:11.587 --> 00:20:12.388
I don't remember.

00:20:20.428 --> 00:20:21.188
I'm off.

00:20:23.628 --> 00:20:24.228
Thanks.

00:20:24.827 --> 00:20:25.307
Oh please.

00:20:26.067 --> 00:20:28.228
Don't treat every case as your own.

00:20:28.988 --> 00:20:30.668
I'm not just trying to help you.

00:20:30.747 --> 00:20:31.668
I actually want to

00:20:31.668 --> 00:20:33.148
get involved in Ms. Bai's case.

00:21:09.188 --> 00:21:09.908
You're back.

00:21:10.148 --> 00:21:11.228
How did you get in?

00:21:12.347 --> 00:21:13.587
I contacted the landlady

00:21:13.787 --> 00:21:15.027
and paid one month's rent.

00:21:15.787 --> 00:21:17.067
So now, we're roommates.

00:21:18.347 --> 00:21:19.228
I'm making noodles.

00:21:19.347 --> 00:21:19.948
Want some?

00:21:21.032 --> 00:21:22.609
The landlady said she had told you.

00:21:25.188 --> 00:21:25.468
You...

00:21:25.787 --> 00:21:26.428
I've eaten.

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:35.240
I just saw
the message from the landlady.

00:21:35.988 --> 00:21:36.868
As roommates,

00:21:37.067 --> 00:21:38.628
I hope we can establish three rules.

00:21:39.148 --> 00:21:40.908
First, no laundries or cooking

00:21:40.908 --> 00:21:42.267
after 11 PM.

00:21:42.708 --> 00:21:44.388
Second, don't leave things

00:21:44.747 --> 00:21:46.148
lying around in the common areas.

00:21:46.827 --> 00:21:49.347
Third, we'll put two trash bins

00:21:49.468 --> 00:21:50.307
in the bathroom.

00:21:55.587 --> 00:21:56.428
Don't

00:21:56.668 --> 00:21:57.587
worry too much.

00:21:58.228 --> 00:21:59.547
The landlady insisted on

00:21:59.547 --> 00:22:01.027
three months' rent plus a deposit.

00:22:01.267 --> 00:22:02.388
I bargained with her

00:22:02.868 --> 00:22:04.628
and only paid one month's rent.

00:22:05.668 --> 00:22:07.827
I'm not sure if I'll even
last a full month.

00:22:08.428 --> 00:22:08.988
Why not?

00:22:11.587 --> 00:22:14.428
I might crawl back home any day.

00:22:15.148 --> 00:22:16.228
At Jun An, I finally see

00:22:16.668 --> 00:22:17.827
why it's a crime

00:22:18.107 --> 00:22:19.188
to talk someone

00:22:19.188 --> 00:22:20.188
into law school.

00:22:21.347 --> 00:22:22.587
You're all amazing.

00:22:23.188 --> 00:22:24.468
I'm kind of losing it.

00:22:26.747 --> 00:22:28.027
If you really want to leave,

00:22:28.587 --> 00:22:29.827
why wait a month?

00:22:31.347 --> 00:22:32.908
That's thousands for a month's rent.

00:22:33.148 --> 00:22:34.468
Save it for something better.

00:22:34.787 --> 00:22:36.827
You obviously don't want to leave.

00:22:37.148 --> 00:22:39.067
But you keep talking about going home.

00:22:39.307 --> 00:22:40.507
Do you want to leave

00:22:40.827 --> 00:22:42.267
or are you fishing for sympathy?

00:22:43.067 --> 00:22:44.107
Leave if you want to.

00:22:44.188 --> 00:22:45.628
If not, quit the whining.

00:22:46.067 --> 00:22:47.347
We're all just staff.

00:22:47.347 --> 00:22:49.547
No one's got time to coddle you.

00:22:51.027 --> 00:22:51.988
I should've

00:22:51.988 --> 00:22:53.547
recorded this and posted it online.

00:22:53.628 --> 00:22:54.988
It'd get more clicks than

00:22:54.988 --> 00:22:55.827
the Warm Nest video.

00:22:57.228 --> 00:22:57.787
Ren Jiatong,

00:22:58.708 --> 00:23:00.267
why don't you start a channel?

00:23:00.827 --> 00:23:01.347
Call it

00:23:02.708 --> 00:23:05.587
"Sassy Lady Lawyer's Brutal Truths."

00:23:05.587 --> 00:23:06.267
It'll go viral.

00:23:09.827 --> 00:23:10.307
My noodles.

00:23:12.547 --> 00:23:14.148
Smell amazing. Let me serve you a bowl.

00:23:17.307 --> 00:23:18.228
I said I'm not hungry.

00:23:26.027 --> 00:23:27.868
Guo Xiaoyu, you're a great cook.

00:23:29.228 --> 00:23:30.628
My boyfriend says the same.

00:23:31.347 --> 00:23:33.228
He keeps complaining
that I can't cook for him

00:23:33.307 --> 00:23:36.008
due to long-distance relationship.
So his "happiness index" dropped.

00:23:36.347 --> 00:23:37.827
He begs me to go home every day.

00:23:39.587 --> 00:23:41.908
Why doesn't he do something about it?

00:23:42.507 --> 00:23:43.547
If he hates it,

00:23:43.988 --> 00:23:45.547
why doesn't he come to Beijing?

00:23:45.948 --> 00:23:46.747
He's got legs.

00:23:49.587 --> 00:23:50.188
True.

00:23:52.148 --> 00:23:54.347
That's a surprisingly valid point.

00:23:56.027 --> 00:23:57.468
I'll talk to him about this.

00:24:05.507 --> 00:24:06.388
My baby is calling.

00:24:08.868 --> 00:24:10.507
Don't forget to clean the living room.

00:24:10.507 --> 00:24:11.188
Got it.

00:24:16.925 --> 00:24:20.072
(Bai Xiao: Good.)

00:24:30.708 --> 00:24:32.228
(Ren Jiatong: Ms. Bai replied, "Good".)

00:24:33.347 --> 00:24:33.908
(Jiang Chen: I found)

00:24:34.148 --> 00:24:35.587
(the name of that person.)

00:24:35.628 --> 00:24:37.148
(He's the film's script supervisor.)

00:24:37.388 --> 00:24:37.948
(Jiang Chen,)

00:24:38.668 --> 00:24:39.628
(thanks for today.)

00:24:41.107 --> 00:24:42.307
(It's the weekend.)

00:24:44.547 --> 00:24:45.868
(Go home and rest.)

00:24:46.988 --> 00:24:47.428
(I...)

00:24:57.296 --> 00:24:59.336
(Ren Jiatong)

00:25:04.447 --> 00:25:06.344
(Isabelle
Aesthetic and Plastic Surgery Hospital)

00:25:08.668 --> 00:25:09.148
Sir,

00:25:09.388 --> 00:25:10.827
I'm sending you

00:25:10.827 --> 00:25:11.948
my legal advice

00:25:12.027 --> 00:25:13.107
through a courier.

00:25:13.868 --> 00:25:14.228
Yeah.

00:25:14.668 --> 00:25:15.628
Tell me when you get it.

00:25:15.668 --> 00:25:16.307
Thank you.

00:25:21.948 --> 00:25:22.668
Bye, sir.

00:25:23.388 --> 00:25:23.868
Jiang Chen.

00:25:24.587 --> 00:25:25.188
Early again?

00:25:27.347 --> 00:25:29.228
Last night, I rewatched the movie.

00:25:29.228 --> 00:25:31.787
I found a line in dialect.

00:25:32.067 --> 00:25:33.307
The uncle confirmed that

00:25:33.388 --> 00:25:34.547
it was his hometown dialect.

00:25:34.587 --> 00:25:35.587
His novel has

00:25:35.868 --> 00:25:37.307
the exact same line.

00:25:37.747 --> 00:25:38.747
But the key is

00:25:39.188 --> 00:25:40.908
that the producers misunderstood

00:25:40.908 --> 00:25:42.428
the line's true meaning.

00:25:42.587 --> 00:25:43.388
They misused it.

00:25:43.747 --> 00:25:45.347
I compiled our findings and sent them

00:25:45.347 --> 00:25:46.027
to him.

00:25:46.547 --> 00:25:47.067
Great.

00:25:48.228 --> 00:25:49.148
I also advised him

00:25:49.148 --> 00:25:51.587
to explore avenues
beyond judicial processes to safeguard

00:25:51.587 --> 00:25:52.267
his rights.

00:25:52.628 --> 00:25:54.507
He can get someone to post it on Weibo

00:25:54.507 --> 00:25:55.668
and use new media

00:25:55.868 --> 00:25:57.188
to spread it.

00:25:57.507 --> 00:25:58.107
Why?

00:25:58.668 --> 00:26:00.587
Aren't you pushing an elder

00:26:00.587 --> 00:26:02.708
to pressure courts with public opinions?

00:26:04.027 --> 00:26:05.787
That's a wild accusation.

00:26:06.228 --> 00:26:07.547
As future lawyers,

00:26:07.587 --> 00:26:09.547
our goal is to solve problems
for the clients.

00:26:09.747 --> 00:26:10.988
Now we have solid evidence.

00:26:11.148 --> 00:26:12.968
No sensationalism
or orchestrated narratives.

00:26:13.428 --> 00:26:14.708
Jiang Chen, you're too dogmatic.

00:26:16.228 --> 00:26:17.307
I-I'm dogmatic?

00:26:18.107 --> 00:26:18.507
Jiatong.

00:26:19.388 --> 00:26:21.288
Why didn't you wake me up?
I almost overslept.

00:26:23.188 --> 00:26:23.988
- Morning.
- Morning.

00:26:25.267 --> 00:26:25.864
What's wrong?

00:26:26.587 --> 00:26:27.747
Nothing. Let's go.

00:26:29.148 --> 00:26:30.148
We're having a meeting.

00:26:30.988 --> 00:26:31.908
So early?

00:26:31.908 --> 00:26:32.616
What's it about?

00:26:32.908 --> 00:26:33.468
No idea.

00:26:34.228 --> 00:26:35.428
But it's nothing trivial.

00:26:37.107 --> 00:26:37.827
We need you

00:26:37.868 --> 00:26:39.908
to assist with this case at hand.

00:26:40.107 --> 00:26:41.228
Here are the basics.

00:26:43.948 --> 00:26:44.988
Celebrity Ms. Xiao

00:26:45.107 --> 00:26:45.868
saw a poster

00:26:45.868 --> 00:26:47.468
from a plastic surgery hospital,

00:26:47.948 --> 00:26:48.827
and believes that

00:26:48.827 --> 00:26:50.107
it's adapted from her image.

00:26:56.746 --> 00:26:59.148
(Isabelle
Aesthetic and Plastic Surgery Hospital)

00:26:59.148 --> 00:27:01.228
The hospital used this poster
without her consent.

00:27:01.628 --> 00:27:03.468
While the hospital
didn't explicitly state

00:27:03.468 --> 00:27:04.468
that the woman

00:27:04.587 --> 00:27:05.347
in the poster

00:27:05.388 --> 00:27:06.908
received their weight loss treatment.

00:27:07.228 --> 00:27:08.507
Their use of this illustration

00:27:08.948 --> 00:27:10.428
is deliberately misleading,

00:27:10.747 --> 00:27:12.067
suggesting that Ms. Xiao

00:27:12.148 --> 00:27:13.468
received weight loss treatments

00:27:13.468 --> 00:27:14.188
from them.

00:27:15.827 --> 00:27:16.908
I'm a fan of her.

00:27:18.428 --> 00:27:19.948
I've been following this.

00:27:19.948 --> 00:27:21.388
It infuriated me.

00:27:22.868 --> 00:27:25.067
But it's a cartoon,
not her actual photo.

00:27:25.307 --> 00:27:26.388
Can we directly claim

00:27:26.388 --> 00:27:28.428
that the hospital
violated her portrait rights?

00:27:28.908 --> 00:27:29.747
Absolutely.

00:27:30.547 --> 00:27:32.148
Even a cartoon adaptation

00:27:32.267 --> 00:27:34.347
qualifies as her portrait.

00:27:34.708 --> 00:27:37.067
We can pursue
a portrait rights infringement case.

00:27:37.587 --> 00:27:39.547
But since the client approached us,

00:27:39.948 --> 00:27:41.868
our focus shouldn't be on establishing

00:27:41.868 --> 00:27:43.228
but winning the case.

00:27:45.148 --> 00:27:45.948
Ms. Xiao

00:27:45.988 --> 00:27:47.428
entrusted us to present

00:27:47.428 --> 00:27:48.188
her case.

00:27:48.347 --> 00:27:50.988
She wants to sue the hospital
for portrait rights violations.

00:27:51.708 --> 00:27:54.148
The first round of Talent Hunt Program
will end in three days.

00:27:54.148 --> 00:27:56.468
Mr. Zhuang approved this
as a practice that counts

00:27:56.628 --> 00:27:58.267
as your third assignment.

00:27:59.067 --> 00:28:01.107
I'll email the materials shortly.

00:28:01.428 --> 00:28:02.347
By this time tomorrow,

00:28:02.587 --> 00:28:04.547
all of you will
present your case analyses.

00:28:11.307 --> 00:28:11.908
Thank you.

00:28:15.908 --> 00:28:16.388
Mr. Zhou.

00:28:17.468 --> 00:28:17.908
Mr. Zhou.

00:28:18.507 --> 00:28:18.948
Yeah?

00:28:20.067 --> 00:28:20.468
Speak.

00:28:22.148 --> 00:28:22.908
Well,

00:28:24.428 --> 00:28:25.827
I'm working hard,

00:28:26.267 --> 00:28:28.307
but I always fall short somehow.

00:28:28.628 --> 00:28:30.228
Ren Jiatong immediately

00:28:30.228 --> 00:28:31.908
grasped the key points immediately.

00:28:32.347 --> 00:28:33.708
It's about winning

00:28:33.708 --> 00:28:34.827
rather than establishing

00:28:34.948 --> 00:28:35.708
the case.

00:28:36.747 --> 00:28:38.708
I feel like I'm always slow to catch on.

00:28:39.868 --> 00:28:41.267
Ren Jiatong is exceptional.

00:28:41.668 --> 00:28:43.228
Her prior experience helps.

00:28:43.787 --> 00:28:45.587
But don't be discouraged.
You're not bad.

00:28:46.787 --> 00:28:48.148
Right now, it seems

00:28:48.228 --> 00:28:49.307
Ren Jiatong and Jiang Chen

00:28:49.307 --> 00:28:50.948
are the top candidates among us.

00:28:51.587 --> 00:28:53.188
If the Talent Hunt Program

00:28:53.188 --> 00:28:54.468
retains one person in the end,

00:28:54.668 --> 00:28:56.388
it'll certainly be one of them.

00:28:58.228 --> 00:28:59.388
Does that mean

00:28:59.628 --> 00:29:01.708
I shouldn't even keep trying?

00:29:04.267 --> 00:29:05.587
I understand your peer pressure.

00:29:05.948 --> 00:29:07.668
It's worse for the more talented.

00:29:08.708 --> 00:29:10.027
I was once in your shoes.

00:29:11.267 --> 00:29:13.507
Competition, elimination, retention...

00:29:13.988 --> 00:29:16.027
Among my peers of trainee lawyers,

00:29:16.388 --> 00:29:18.267
I wasn't the most impressive.

00:29:18.787 --> 00:29:19.868
Before joining Jun An,

00:29:20.027 --> 00:29:21.388
I did other jobs for years.

00:29:21.668 --> 00:29:22.827
Yet here I am.

00:29:23.827 --> 00:29:24.228
Guess

00:29:24.628 --> 00:29:26.587
why this program lasts three months.

00:29:29.267 --> 00:29:30.507
It's a marathon.

00:29:31.307 --> 00:29:32.148
Work hard

00:29:32.468 --> 00:29:33.428
and you stand a chance.

00:29:33.948 --> 00:29:34.708
You've secured

00:29:34.708 --> 00:29:36.307
opportunities from the lawyer pool

00:29:36.628 --> 00:29:37.827
and earned 15 points.

00:29:38.307 --> 00:29:39.388
That's a solid start.

00:29:42.228 --> 00:29:42.827
I see.

00:29:43.188 --> 00:29:43.908
Thank you.

00:29:44.307 --> 00:29:45.948
I won't stay last forever.

00:29:47.547 --> 00:29:47.948
Go for it.

00:29:49.428 --> 00:29:50.148
Thank you.

00:29:56.267 --> 00:29:57.267
While I'm gone,

00:29:57.267 --> 00:29:58.988
(Tian Min, aged 30)
you've taken over as the mentor.

00:29:59.428 --> 00:30:00.587
(Lawyer of Dispute Resolution Group 1)
Ms. Tian.

00:30:01.908 --> 00:30:03.240
Back from your maternity leave?

00:30:05.507 --> 00:30:06.468
You haven't changed.

00:30:08.027 --> 00:30:10.468
Don't give us working moms
body image anxiety.

00:30:10.587 --> 00:30:11.428
It's tough enough.

00:30:12.507 --> 00:30:14.267
I've gained ten pounds.

00:30:15.307 --> 00:30:16.267
Don't say you can tell.

00:30:16.507 --> 00:30:17.428
I really can't tell.

00:30:17.948 --> 00:30:18.827
You look amazing.

00:30:19.708 --> 00:30:21.388
But it's only been two months.

00:30:21.388 --> 00:30:22.428
You sure you got this?

00:30:23.148 --> 00:30:23.747
You...

00:30:24.067 --> 00:30:25.547
You workaholic. Just like Ms. Bai.

00:30:26.747 --> 00:30:27.347
Come on.

00:30:27.628 --> 00:30:28.988
Ms. Bai wouldn't let me work.

00:30:29.228 --> 00:30:30.628
She told me to rest at home.

00:30:31.708 --> 00:30:32.587
I was going crazy.

00:30:33.067 --> 00:30:34.188
The kid is crying

00:30:34.428 --> 00:30:35.747
and we're losing it.

00:30:36.708 --> 00:30:39.468
Work's my only escape for peace.

00:30:43.228 --> 00:30:45.347
That young lady is a trainee lawyer?

00:30:47.267 --> 00:30:49.148
She's feeling pressure comparing herself

00:30:49.547 --> 00:30:50.388
to her peers.

00:30:52.428 --> 00:30:55.027
She should learn from you.

00:30:56.148 --> 00:30:57.067
After all,

00:30:57.067 --> 00:30:59.708
you thrived under my dominance.

00:31:01.067 --> 00:31:01.587
You're

00:31:02.347 --> 00:31:03.747
teasing me right after returning?

00:31:36.388 --> 00:31:38.708
Mr. Zhuang heard that you're holding

00:31:38.708 --> 00:31:39.628
a discussion today

00:31:39.908 --> 00:31:40.787
and wants to sit in.

00:31:41.587 --> 00:31:42.628
- Good day, Mr. Zhuang.
- Good day, Mr. Zhuang.

00:31:43.347 --> 00:31:43.948
Hello.

00:31:44.908 --> 00:31:45.547
Don't mind me.

00:31:46.067 --> 00:31:48.787
Speak freely.

00:31:56.107 --> 00:31:57.787
Legally speaking,

00:31:57.787 --> 00:32:00.388
portraiture hinges on identifiability.

00:32:00.908 --> 00:32:03.228
If an image depicts features

00:32:03.228 --> 00:32:04.347
that distinctly correlate

00:32:04.347 --> 00:32:06.107
to a specific individual,

00:32:06.148 --> 00:32:07.307
then that depiction

00:32:07.507 --> 00:32:08.747
(View A: hinging on identifiability)
falls under China's legal

00:32:08.747 --> 00:32:10.228
(File lawsuit right away)
protections for portrait rights.

00:32:11.347 --> 00:32:12.067
I agree.

00:32:13.708 --> 00:32:14.827
You're right.

00:32:15.267 --> 00:32:16.787
But while legally sound,

00:32:16.787 --> 00:32:18.267
this alone won't

00:32:18.267 --> 00:32:20.148
convince a judge in court.

00:32:20.868 --> 00:32:21.507
We may need

00:32:21.507 --> 00:32:22.747
(View B: Insufficient evidence)
stronger evidence.

00:32:24.228 --> 00:32:24.868
Because

00:32:25.868 --> 00:32:26.948
we can't be too dogmatic.

00:32:29.908 --> 00:32:31.507
Jiang Chen is right.

00:32:38.428 --> 00:32:40.507
If you can't agree on it,

00:32:40.547 --> 00:32:42.228
you can split into teams

00:32:42.628 --> 00:32:43.708
for presentations.

00:32:44.628 --> 00:32:45.107
Right?

00:32:45.228 --> 00:32:45.587
Yeah.

00:32:46.307 --> 00:32:47.668
As Mr. Zhuang said,

00:32:47.988 --> 00:32:48.708
split up.

00:32:49.228 --> 00:32:51.587
Draft a legal assessment

00:32:51.908 --> 00:32:53.428
for Ms. Xiao's case,

00:32:53.747 --> 00:32:56.948
evaluating the feasibility
of suing the hospital

00:32:56.988 --> 00:32:58.628
for portrait rights infringement.

00:32:59.148 --> 00:33:00.587
Present it tomorrow

00:33:00.988 --> 00:33:01.547
morning.

00:33:01.988 --> 00:33:03.468
This is a team-based competition.

00:33:03.868 --> 00:33:04.587
Members of

00:33:04.988 --> 00:33:06.668
the winning team get 20 points each.

00:33:07.188 --> 00:33:07.547
Alright?

00:33:08.468 --> 00:33:08.908
Got it.

00:33:09.908 --> 00:33:10.280
Alright.

00:33:10.507 --> 00:33:11.188
So...

00:33:12.228 --> 00:33:12.628
That's it.

00:33:18.267 --> 00:33:19.347
Ren Jiatong, here.

00:33:20.827 --> 00:33:21.228
Come on.

00:33:29.868 --> 00:33:31.148
Jiatong, sit here.

00:33:35.148 --> 00:33:36.547
Call me by my full name.

00:33:37.067 --> 00:33:39.067
The nickname makes me

00:33:39.067 --> 00:33:39.988
cringe.

00:33:41.908 --> 00:33:43.027
Have some yogurt.

00:33:45.067 --> 00:33:46.668
Why are you suddenly so kind?

00:33:48.107 --> 00:33:50.668
Don't tell me your boyfriend is visiting

00:33:50.827 --> 00:33:52.067
and staying with you.

00:33:52.067 --> 00:33:52.868
Not happening.

00:33:53.708 --> 00:33:54.307
No.

00:33:55.547 --> 00:33:56.708
I didn't mean to upset you.

00:33:58.148 --> 00:33:59.188
I don't get it.

00:33:59.267 --> 00:34:00.228
How did you upset me?

00:34:00.948 --> 00:34:02.868
I stood by Jiang Chen

00:34:02.868 --> 00:34:03.868
during the meeting.

00:34:04.388 --> 00:34:05.388
It was nothing personal.

00:34:05.948 --> 00:34:07.428
If you think having disagreements

00:34:07.428 --> 00:34:08.988
means something personal,

00:34:09.268 --> 00:34:10.547
you shouldn't be a lawyer.

00:34:11.027 --> 00:34:12.468
This is what we deal with.

00:34:15.107 --> 00:34:16.107
Now I'm relieved.

00:34:18.948 --> 00:34:19.748
I'm also relieved.

00:34:20.988 --> 00:34:22.468
Thanks for the yogurt.

00:34:26.187 --> 00:34:27.187
I've noticed something.

00:34:27.748 --> 00:34:29.748
Are you afraid of owing others favors?

00:34:30.107 --> 00:34:31.308
And you set boundaries.

00:34:32.027 --> 00:34:33.828
That's why you keep everything separate

00:34:33.828 --> 00:34:34.788
and never mix

00:34:34.788 --> 00:34:35.988
your things with mine.

00:34:36.667 --> 00:34:38.468
Every time I treat you to food,

00:34:38.468 --> 00:34:39.667
you pay me afterward.

00:34:40.707 --> 00:34:41.868
You won't even accept

00:34:41.868 --> 00:34:43.507
my yogurt without knowing the reason.

00:34:44.868 --> 00:34:45.468
Am I right?

00:34:52.187 --> 00:34:54.868
Detective Guo, you've got
such elaborate logic,

00:34:54.868 --> 00:34:55.988
just like Sherlock Holmes.

00:34:55.988 --> 00:34:57.587
But once you're done analyzing me,

00:34:57.587 --> 00:34:59.908
use your superb investigative skills

00:35:00.788 --> 00:35:02.587
to check if your food is sold out.

00:35:04.428 --> 00:35:05.468
My Braised Chicken Rice!

00:35:09.627 --> 00:35:10.388
You're right.

00:35:12.948 --> 00:35:14.147
Sherlock Holmes,

00:35:14.868 --> 00:35:16.027
my boyfriend forever.

00:35:24.828 --> 00:35:25.788
This seat is taken.

00:35:27.027 --> 00:35:28.748
Ren Jiatong, I want to team up with you.

00:35:30.627 --> 00:35:32.067
I agree with your approach.

00:35:32.587 --> 00:35:33.948
Let's team up. I want to win.

00:35:44.187 --> 00:35:44.587
Huang Yue.

00:35:45.547 --> 00:35:45.948
Thank you.

00:35:46.948 --> 00:35:48.027
- Ren Jiatong.
- Thanks.

00:35:48.507 --> 00:35:49.908
Let's go on.

00:36:21.547 --> 00:36:22.908
I'm still working.

00:36:23.027 --> 00:36:24.268
I ranked last.

00:36:24.268 --> 00:36:25.587
I must catch up this time.

00:36:25.988 --> 00:36:28.388
And this time, Mr. Zhuang will listen

00:36:28.388 --> 00:36:29.227
to our reports.

00:36:30.147 --> 00:36:31.948
Those small assessments don't need

00:36:32.268 --> 00:36:33.187
too much devotion.

00:36:33.428 --> 00:36:34.627
You taught me that.

00:36:34.627 --> 00:36:35.547
Be more mature.

00:36:35.547 --> 00:36:36.587
Find ways to win.

00:36:37.147 --> 00:36:37.868
I have to go.

00:36:39.107 --> 00:36:39.667
What's wrong?

00:36:41.667 --> 00:36:42.067
Nothing.

00:36:47.587 --> 00:36:48.067
Wait.

00:36:48.107 --> 00:36:49.908
I'll order you a bubble tea.

00:36:50.868 --> 00:36:52.587
I haven't thanked you for helping

00:36:52.587 --> 00:36:53.428
with the translation.

00:36:53.428 --> 00:36:54.268
It's my treat.

00:36:54.507 --> 00:36:55.067
It's fine.

00:36:55.227 --> 00:36:56.227
Let me order it.

00:36:58.908 --> 00:37:00.507
Alright, Yue. That's enough.

00:37:01.748 --> 00:37:02.868
I'm free this weekend.

00:37:03.268 --> 00:37:03.988
End your work.

00:37:04.468 --> 00:37:06.187
Come keep me company. I miss you.

00:37:07.227 --> 00:37:08.507
We've always been like this.

00:37:09.027 --> 00:37:10.587
I can only see him when he's free,

00:37:11.107 --> 00:37:12.908
and I have to drop work.

00:37:13.348 --> 00:37:14.388
I suddenly feel

00:37:14.988 --> 00:37:16.627
like a pet he keeps.

00:37:23.147 --> 00:37:24.587
As an expert, I can tell that

00:37:25.147 --> 00:37:25.868
he's not for you.

00:37:26.348 --> 00:37:27.627
Between a man and a career,

00:37:27.707 --> 00:37:29.268
always choose the career.

00:37:29.868 --> 00:37:31.027
Unless that guy

00:37:31.348 --> 00:37:32.948
is as good as my Zhubao.

00:37:35.187 --> 00:37:36.027
Why are you

00:37:36.268 --> 00:37:37.027
still working?

00:37:37.027 --> 00:37:37.908
It's dinner time.

00:37:38.507 --> 00:37:41.348
I'm wondering
whether the original comic would

00:37:41.428 --> 00:37:42.587
provide some evidence.

00:37:43.468 --> 00:37:44.107
Original comic?

00:37:45.308 --> 00:37:47.348
This art style looks familiar.

00:37:47.587 --> 00:37:49.948
So I'm checking some anime websites

00:37:49.948 --> 00:37:50.547
for clues.

00:37:56.476 --> 00:37:58.728
(Comic website)

00:37:59.507 --> 00:38:00.147
Guo Xiaoyu.

00:38:02.227 --> 00:38:02.988
Have a minute?

00:38:03.107 --> 00:38:03.748
Let's talk.

00:38:04.707 --> 00:38:06.147
Go ahead. I have to go.

00:38:11.788 --> 00:38:12.988
Are you in trouble

00:38:13.187 --> 00:38:14.707
or facing some difficulty?

00:38:14.908 --> 00:38:15.587
No.

00:38:15.948 --> 00:38:17.268
Then why are you avoiding me?

00:38:18.868 --> 00:38:20.027
I'm not avoiding you.

00:38:21.388 --> 00:38:22.667
If you have any problems,

00:38:22.667 --> 00:38:23.547
I can help you.

00:38:27.308 --> 00:38:29.348
I just don't like being lied to,

00:38:30.868 --> 00:38:32.468
especially by friends.

00:38:34.828 --> 00:38:35.627
I lied to you?

00:38:43.988 --> 00:38:44.507
Whatever.

00:38:45.268 --> 00:38:46.792
I don't intend to make friends anyway.

00:38:59.308 --> 00:39:00.187
I just got home.

00:39:16.025 --> 00:39:19.464
(Guo Xiaoyu)

00:39:19.471 --> 00:39:21.288
(Jiang Chen: Not bad, Xiaoyu.)

00:39:21.288 --> 00:39:23.304
(Li Ke: This is Mr. Zhuang's case.
Nail this and we're safe next round.)

00:39:23.304 --> 00:39:26.248
(Guo Xiaoyu)

00:39:28.604 --> 00:39:30.099
(Zhubao)

00:39:47.707 --> 00:39:49.868
I need to check
my horoscope for this week

00:39:49.868 --> 00:39:51.187
and my birth chart.

00:39:51.908 --> 00:39:52.748
It's been so rough.

00:39:52.748 --> 00:39:54.227
I've been arguing with people.

00:39:55.587 --> 00:39:56.627
You believe in that?

00:39:56.908 --> 00:39:57.788
Of course.

00:39:57.948 --> 00:39:59.868
Theory guides practice.

00:40:02.067 --> 00:40:02.667
Oh no.

00:40:03.388 --> 00:40:05.067
My work will be turbulent this week.

00:40:05.788 --> 00:40:07.388
Am I going to get eliminated

00:40:08.268 --> 00:40:09.308
in this round?

00:40:13.587 --> 00:40:14.632
Guo Xiaoyu hasn't arrived.

00:40:14.868 --> 00:40:16.227
Ren Jiatong, you go first.

00:40:24.468 --> 00:40:25.308
This comic

00:40:25.308 --> 00:40:27.187
was adopted by the hospital's poster.

00:40:27.428 --> 00:40:28.227
Last night, I found

00:40:28.227 --> 00:40:29.748
the source of this comic.

00:40:30.067 --> 00:40:31.348
It was posted on a niche

00:40:31.348 --> 00:40:32.308
anime-themed website.

00:40:32.707 --> 00:40:33.868
The original work

00:40:33.868 --> 00:40:35.587
is a fan-created content

00:40:35.587 --> 00:40:36.788
based on Ms. Xiao.

00:40:37.107 --> 00:40:39.067
This character is named

00:40:39.308 --> 00:40:39.828
Xiaoxiao.

00:40:39.828 --> 00:40:40.988
Same as Xiaoyu's approach.

00:40:40.988 --> 00:40:43.348
Homophones of Ms. Xiao's surname.

00:40:43.988 --> 00:40:45.667
The netizens all agreed

00:40:45.868 --> 00:40:48.067
(This is definitely my queen.)
that it resembles Ms. Xiao.

00:40:48.948 --> 00:40:50.428
We can use this to prove

00:40:50.428 --> 00:40:52.227
that the hospital plagiarized the comic

00:40:52.227 --> 00:40:54.067
and violated Ms. Xiao's portrait rights.

00:41:02.147 --> 00:41:04.227
That concludes our team's presentation.

00:41:04.388 --> 00:41:04.988
Thank you.

00:41:08.748 --> 00:41:09.388
Well done.

00:41:20.308 --> 00:41:22.107
How could she do this?

00:41:22.948 --> 00:41:24.507
You're being naive.

00:41:24.908 --> 00:41:26.468
You're living with your competitor,

00:41:26.667 --> 00:41:27.468
yet you casually

00:41:27.468 --> 00:41:28.627
left your laptop there.

00:41:28.988 --> 00:41:30.547
(Zhu Zhisheng, aged 23)
She's a top student

00:41:30.868 --> 00:41:31.468
(Hangzhou Eawan Tech, R&D Dept)
with real work experience.

00:41:31.468 --> 00:41:32.707
(Software Engineer)
You have no experience.

00:41:33.627 --> 00:41:35.308
You're no match for her.

00:41:36.187 --> 00:41:37.067
Now you see?

00:41:37.147 --> 00:41:38.707
There are no friends at work.

00:41:39.147 --> 00:41:40.788
Jun An isn't for you either.

00:41:47.468 --> 00:41:48.788
I want to go home.

00:41:49.667 --> 00:41:50.147
Great.

00:41:50.428 --> 00:41:50.748
Yes.

00:41:50.988 --> 00:41:51.748
Come back now.

00:41:52.187 --> 00:41:53.348
I'll ask for leave.

00:41:53.468 --> 00:41:55.388
I'll come to Beijing to pick you up.

00:41:55.908 --> 00:41:57.908
We'll have some fun
for a few days, okay?

00:41:59.067 --> 00:41:59.468
Okay.

00:42:00.268 --> 00:42:02.187
Come soon. I miss you.

00:42:18.707 --> 00:42:19.468
I'm sorry.

00:42:20.547 --> 00:42:22.147
I held our team back.

00:42:24.308 --> 00:42:25.388
Xiaoyu, why didn't you

00:42:25.388 --> 00:42:26.308
confront them?

00:42:26.627 --> 00:42:28.268
I was ready to slam the table.

00:42:31.388 --> 00:42:33.988
Actually, it's normal
to have the same idea.

00:42:34.187 --> 00:42:34.707
Normal?

00:42:35.868 --> 00:42:37.908
It's just a niche anime site.

00:42:37.908 --> 00:42:39.388
No one outside the ACG community

00:42:39.388 --> 00:42:40.547
would know about it.

00:42:42.667 --> 00:42:44.147
Had we known they'd cheat,

00:42:44.147 --> 00:42:46.067
we should've presented first.

00:42:46.988 --> 00:42:48.348
Xiaoyu, what should we...

00:42:50.227 --> 00:42:51.468
Wait, what are you doing?

00:42:52.107 --> 00:42:53.468
The idea came from Guo Xiaoyu.

00:42:53.468 --> 00:42:54.667
She found the website too.

00:42:54.667 --> 00:42:55.828
Why do you get to

00:42:55.828 --> 00:42:56.868
criticize her?

00:42:57.268 --> 00:42:58.908
What do you mean?

00:42:58.908 --> 00:43:00.268
We're on the same team.

00:43:00.748 --> 00:43:02.107
I'm just showing solidarity.

00:43:02.268 --> 00:43:03.507
But we have no proof

00:43:03.707 --> 00:43:04.547
to support this.

00:43:05.147 --> 00:43:05.988
And I don't think
