Hey, Byeong-gi!

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:15.264
Byeong-gi, the pink dress!

00:01:27.735 --> 00:01:29.320
Soulishere?

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.991
It feels strange meeting you
after only talking on the app.

00:02:16.492 --> 00:02:17.660
How should I put it?

00:02:17.743 --> 00:02:20.704
It's like seeing an animated character
from my imagination

00:02:20.788 --> 00:02:22.748
come to life.

00:02:22.831 --> 00:02:26.543
I can't quite believe
you're the same person as well.

00:02:27.586 --> 00:02:29.713
It might take some time
to get used to this.

00:02:29.797 --> 00:02:30.631
Of course.

00:02:30.714 --> 00:02:32.132
It's our first time
meeting face to face, after all.

00:02:34.093 --> 00:02:34.927
Technically,

00:02:35.427 --> 00:02:36.679
it's not our first time.

00:02:37.763 --> 00:02:39.890
We briefly met
when I bought the rice cooker.

00:02:41.767 --> 00:02:43.811
Oh, that's right.

00:02:44.311 --> 00:02:46.355
-We saw each other for a moment.
-Yes.

00:02:47.898 --> 00:02:49.149
Go ahead and answer your phone.

00:02:49.233 --> 00:02:50.317
Excuse me for a moment, then.

00:02:51.735 --> 00:02:52.778
MR. LIM HYEON-JUN

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.709
It's okay. It's not an important call.

00:03:07.251 --> 00:03:08.085
You know,

00:03:08.168 --> 00:03:10.796
your voice sounds different
than it does on the phone.

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:12.172
Really?

00:03:12.256 --> 00:03:15.509
You sounded exactly like Kang Pil-gu
when we talked on the phone.

00:03:15.592 --> 00:03:18.262
Your Kang Pil-gu impression was so good,

00:03:18.345 --> 00:03:20.472
I wondered if you really were him.

00:03:21.181 --> 00:03:25.394
That's right,
I did a Kang Pil-gu impression.

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:30.399
Don't you remember?

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:36.155
I think that was our first phone call…

00:03:39.241 --> 00:03:41.118
The thing is…

00:03:42.161 --> 00:03:43.495
Then,

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:46.582
do you remember the station
where we met for the rice cooker deal?

00:03:46.665 --> 00:03:49.585
The station where we met
for the rice cooker transaction?

00:03:52.254 --> 00:03:54.173
Seongil Station!

00:03:54.256 --> 00:03:55.716
That was Seongil Station, right?

00:03:56.467 --> 00:04:00.679
Then, do you remember
which season of Kang Pil-gu

00:04:00.763 --> 00:04:01.972
I said was my favorite?

00:04:02.056 --> 00:04:05.225
Your favorite season of Kang Pil-gu was…

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.270
The best one, Season three.

00:04:09.104 --> 00:04:10.230
Okay, last question.

00:04:10.314 --> 00:04:11.732
Go ahead and ask.

00:04:11.815 --> 00:04:12.816
-Let's circle back.
-Okay.

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.985
When we first talked on the phone,

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:17.946
what was the Kang Pil-gu impression
you did for me?

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.324
Let me think…

00:04:32.961 --> 00:04:34.046
"You…"

00:04:43.305 --> 00:04:45.474
What did you do? What was it?

00:04:54.566 --> 00:04:56.693
"They say you can't fix people."

00:04:56.777 --> 00:04:59.321
"But I do."

00:05:00.989 --> 00:05:02.199
That's right!

00:05:03.826 --> 00:05:05.160
So you do remember.

00:05:05.869 --> 00:05:07.496
That's my favorite line.

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.254
-I'm sorry, but I need to message someone.
-Of course.

00:05:19.508 --> 00:05:21.009
Mr. Lim, why don't you go home?

00:05:21.593 --> 00:05:22.886
I'll take care of this.

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:27.516
The weather is so nice today.

00:05:29.143 --> 00:05:30.853
Gosh, look over there.

00:05:30.936 --> 00:05:32.354
The sky looks amazing today.

00:05:36.233 --> 00:05:37.943
Wow, are those all stars?

00:05:41.446 --> 00:05:42.406
Damn it.

00:05:56.545 --> 00:05:57.754
You're here from Onion, right?

00:05:58.672 --> 00:05:59.715
I'm a fan of Lim Hyeon-jun.

00:05:59.798 --> 00:06:01.508
Have you seen Kang Pil-gu in person?

00:06:01.592 --> 00:06:03.385
-I have.
-What did you think of him?

00:06:03.468 --> 00:06:05.053
He was really cool, of course.

00:06:05.846 --> 00:06:08.140
He's manly,
yet still has that boyish charm.

00:06:09.183 --> 00:06:10.684
I'm not married.

00:06:13.729 --> 00:06:15.731
It's nice to hear your voice.

00:06:19.026 --> 00:06:19.985
I feel the same.

00:06:20.736 --> 00:06:23.155
Can you say a line from Kang Pil-gu?

00:06:23.238 --> 00:06:24.865
Wow, how are you so good at impressions?

00:06:24.948 --> 00:06:26.158
My gosh, you sounded just like him.

00:06:26.909 --> 00:06:29.786
But she sounded like
a completely different person.

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:31.788
Of course, I don't intend to apologize.

00:06:31.872 --> 00:06:33.957
I don't even want an apology anymore.

00:06:34.041 --> 00:06:36.376
It's ridiculous to cater to every tantrum

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:37.961
of a middle-aged man acting like a diva!

00:06:38.045 --> 00:06:42.507
I can destroy you
with nothing more than my writing.

00:06:42.591 --> 00:06:43.467
That's right.

00:06:44.384 --> 00:06:45.385
I don't want

00:06:46.261 --> 00:06:47.137
your apology.

00:06:49.014 --> 00:06:49.848
Seriously?

00:06:49.932 --> 00:06:52.935
She was that rude to me,
when she was my fan all along?

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:54.770
How does that make sense?

00:06:54.853 --> 00:06:56.355
It's the first time in my life.

00:06:56.438 --> 00:06:59.441
I've never liked someone
so unconditionally.

00:06:59.983 --> 00:07:02.653
We got off to a bit of an unusual start,

00:07:03.153 --> 00:07:05.322
but I want to get to know you better.

00:07:06.031 --> 00:07:08.242
Will you meet me in person?

00:07:12.412 --> 00:07:14.248
I've been curious about something.

00:07:14.331 --> 00:07:16.500
Why is your nickname "Soulishere"?

00:07:18.752 --> 00:07:20.837
You see, my name is Wi Jeong-sin.

00:07:21.421 --> 00:07:24.591
I thought "Jeong-sinishere"
would sound a little strange,

00:07:24.675 --> 00:07:26.385
so I went with "Soulishere" instead.

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:31.890
Oh, I see.

00:07:32.849 --> 00:07:34.226
Your name is so unique.

00:07:34.309 --> 00:07:36.228
I'm sure anyone who hears it once
would never forget it.

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:38.313
My name is Bak Byeong…

00:07:40.607 --> 00:07:41.441
Byeong?

00:07:44.444 --> 00:07:45.362
It's Jun-gi.

00:07:47.614 --> 00:07:48.490
By the way…

00:07:52.452 --> 00:07:53.745
Thank you

00:07:54.663 --> 00:07:55.497
for meeting me today.

00:07:56.248 --> 00:07:59.293
It took some courage
to ask you to meet me,

00:07:59.376 --> 00:08:01.837
but I'm sure it took courage for you
to show up today.

00:08:03.046 --> 00:08:04.965
When you asked for some time
to think it over,

00:08:05.716 --> 00:08:08.010
I was really nervous
waiting for your response.

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:14.266
I actually have something to tell you.

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:18.395
That's why I came here today.

00:08:22.024 --> 00:08:23.650
Jeez.

00:08:23.734 --> 00:08:25.152
Is everything going okay?

00:08:26.611 --> 00:08:27.821
Darn it.

00:08:28.822 --> 00:08:31.366
He writes dramas for a living,
so he's probably handling it fine.

00:08:58.518 --> 00:09:01.271
I was engaged to someone before.

00:09:01.355 --> 00:09:03.273
While preparing for the wedding,

00:09:03.357 --> 00:09:05.859
we bickered over household goods,
the wedding venue,

00:09:05.942 --> 00:09:08.695
and our honeymoon destination,
which turned into arguments.

00:09:08.779 --> 00:09:11.156
Then our arguments
led to our parents arguing.

00:09:11.239 --> 00:09:15.077
Eventually, it got to the point
where both families opposed the marriage.

00:09:19.331 --> 00:09:20.332
To be honest with you,

00:09:21.875 --> 00:09:24.169
I don't think I'm ready
to be with someone new.

00:09:24.252 --> 00:09:26.421
Seeing someone while I'm still healing

00:09:27.005 --> 00:09:28.715
would be unfair to that person.

00:09:30.967 --> 00:09:34.096
So that's why you asked for time to think.

00:09:36.598 --> 00:09:38.934
Thank you for reaching out to me first,

00:09:39.518 --> 00:09:40.852
but I'm afraid

00:09:40.936 --> 00:09:42.813
I'll have to say no.

00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:52.155
Why the hell didn't you answer your phone?

00:09:52.239 --> 00:09:53.657
Do you know how many times I called?

00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:55.283
It would've thrown me off!

00:09:55.367 --> 00:09:56.952
I told you I'd take care of it.

00:09:57.035 --> 00:09:58.995
Why couldn't you just sit tight and wait?

00:09:59.079 --> 00:10:00.455
It was an emergency situation!

00:10:00.539 --> 00:10:01.540
An emergency situation!

00:10:01.623 --> 00:10:03.708
Like what?
Was she someone you knew or something?

00:10:03.792 --> 00:10:04.709
Yes!

00:10:04.793 --> 00:10:05.669
What?

00:10:11.299 --> 00:10:12.676
EPISODE 9

00:10:18.056 --> 00:10:18.974
You're home.

00:10:19.057 --> 00:10:20.559
They say you can't fix people.

00:10:21.435 --> 00:10:22.561
What's wrong with you?

00:10:22.644 --> 00:10:23.979
But I do.

00:10:24.062 --> 00:10:25.939
Jeong-sin, I have amazing news!

00:10:26.022 --> 00:10:27.190
I passed my audition.

00:10:27.274 --> 00:10:30.735
And it was for Good Detective Kang Pil-gu!

00:10:31.236 --> 00:10:33.321
-Kang Pil-gu?
-Yeah, I'm a rookie detective.

00:10:33.405 --> 00:10:34.364
Awesome, right?

00:10:37.367 --> 00:10:38.660
Good for you.

00:10:38.743 --> 00:10:39.744
Congratulations.

00:10:40.787 --> 00:10:43.582
That's it? This is worthy of an exclusive.

00:10:44.666 --> 00:10:46.334
Not everything can be an exclusive.

00:10:49.379 --> 00:10:50.338
Something happened today, didn't it?

00:10:50.422 --> 00:10:51.590
No.

00:10:52.257 --> 00:10:53.133
Congratulations.

00:10:56.678 --> 00:10:58.555
Maybe she got turned down
looking like that.

00:11:01.099 --> 00:11:02.934
Jeong-sin, did that guy turn you down?

00:11:04.686 --> 00:11:06.104
Yeah, he definitely turned you down.

00:11:07.022 --> 00:11:07.939
Jeez.

00:11:08.607 --> 00:11:11.693
Mr. Lim, can I please
write a script about this?

00:11:11.776 --> 00:11:14.738
Come on, Bak Byeong-gi.

00:11:14.821 --> 00:11:17.282
Man, how could something like this happen?

00:11:17.365 --> 00:11:18.700
It's like a movie.

00:11:18.783 --> 00:11:22.454
A top actor does a secondhand trade
and meets the buyer in real life.

00:11:22.537 --> 00:11:24.748
But it turns out, it's someone he knows.

00:11:26.374 --> 00:11:28.001
My gosh, Wi Jeong-sin.

00:11:28.877 --> 00:11:30.086
Right.

00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:32.380
I knew her name sounded familiar.

00:11:33.173 --> 00:11:35.550
She's the reporter who wrote
all those articles about you, right?

00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:38.595
-Yes.
-Right.

00:11:41.181 --> 00:11:42.724
Isn't this actually a good thing?

00:11:43.558 --> 00:11:45.018
You know exactly who she is.

00:11:46.728 --> 00:11:49.689
I can't tell
if this is a good thing or not.

00:11:49.773 --> 00:11:52.192
The two of us
don't get along in real life,

00:11:52.275 --> 00:11:54.069
but we like each other on Onion.

00:11:54.152 --> 00:11:55.654
I know that woman is this woman,

00:11:55.737 --> 00:11:58.031
but that woman doesn't know
I'm Lim Hyeon-jun.

00:11:58.114 --> 00:11:59.533
This is just…

00:11:59.616 --> 00:12:03.453
It's just a total mess.

00:12:07.832 --> 00:12:10.085
Why are you smirking like that anyway?

00:12:10.168 --> 00:12:11.753
What did you and Ms. Wi talk about?

00:12:12.587 --> 00:12:13.797
Oh, right.

00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:15.715
I ended it smoothly
without going overboard.

00:12:17.759 --> 00:12:19.302
The way I see it,

00:12:19.386 --> 00:12:22.472
you won't get closure on this right away.

00:12:22.556 --> 00:12:24.641
Take your time untangling the mess,

00:12:24.724 --> 00:12:27.310
and in the meantime,
let's focus on this week's shoot.

00:12:27.394 --> 00:12:30.730
I added some more action sequences
to the scenes.

00:12:30.814 --> 00:12:33.733
Do you really want to talk about
action scenes at a time like this?

00:12:34.317 --> 00:12:37.112
Do you think I'm in my right mind
to talk about action scenes?

00:12:37.696 --> 00:12:40.532
Did you forget our promise already?

00:12:43.535 --> 00:12:44.995
Do I have to play back
the recording from earlier?

00:12:45.078 --> 00:12:48.623
Why do you punks
record everything these days?

00:12:50.417 --> 00:12:51.251
Hey, Mr. Lim!

00:12:51.334 --> 00:12:52.252
What?

00:12:53.086 --> 00:12:54.045
What is it now?

00:12:54.129 --> 00:12:56.715
Isn't it possible she sent someone else,

00:12:57.215 --> 00:12:58.133
just like we did?

00:12:59.926 --> 00:13:01.386
I just got chills.

00:13:01.886 --> 00:13:02.846
I did too.

00:13:09.436 --> 00:13:11.396
INVITATION: PRESS CONFERENCE
FOR THE DRAMA "IMPERFECT LOVE"

00:13:14.149 --> 00:13:16.901
Thank you for reaching out to me first,

00:13:16.985 --> 00:13:18.236
but I'm afraid

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:20.030
I'll have to say no.

00:13:30.123 --> 00:13:34.419
I'll have to say no.

00:13:38.882 --> 00:13:42.969
I'll have to say no.

00:13:56.358 --> 00:13:58.526
I'll have to say no.

00:14:06.368 --> 00:14:07.619
Darn it, I forgot again.

00:14:11.373 --> 00:14:14.668
SPORTS EUNSEONG

00:14:17.170 --> 00:14:18.588
It rained a lot today.

00:14:19.255 --> 00:14:20.715
I hope you didn't get caught in it.

00:14:34.312 --> 00:14:35.647
It's supposed to rain today.

00:14:36.272 --> 00:14:37.524
Did you bring an umbrella?

00:14:47.450 --> 00:14:50.412
Why has it been raining so much lately?

00:15:16.312 --> 00:15:17.147
Mr. Lee.

00:15:17.814 --> 00:15:18.815
Are you just getting off work?

00:15:19.524 --> 00:15:20.734
Take this with you.

00:15:21.276 --> 00:15:23.027
It's okay. You should take it.

00:15:23.111 --> 00:15:24.112
Just take it.

00:15:30.785 --> 00:15:31.661
Thank you.

00:15:39.753 --> 00:15:40.587
Get home safely.

00:16:01.065 --> 00:16:02.525
Does the rice cooker work?

00:16:02.609 --> 00:16:04.527
If it doesn't,
I'll give you a 100% refund.

00:16:05.361 --> 00:16:06.905
It was nice meeting you earlier too.

00:16:10.074 --> 00:16:10.950
What are you doing?

00:16:14.662 --> 00:16:15.538
Serve up the rice.

00:16:16.456 --> 00:16:17.457
I'm not eating.

00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:19.375
What? You're not…

00:16:19.459 --> 00:16:21.961
Why won't you eat? I already made dinner.

00:16:27.342 --> 00:16:29.385
There was a nude scene in the movie.

00:16:29.469 --> 00:16:31.513
Were those the actor's real buttocks?

00:16:33.807 --> 00:16:35.975
No, we used a body double for that scene.

00:16:36.059 --> 00:16:38.561
Mr. Kim Dong-jun, I heard
you and your co-star didn't get along.

00:16:38.645 --> 00:16:40.021
Could you clear up the rumors?

00:16:41.147 --> 00:16:42.607
Those rumors aren't true.

00:16:42.690 --> 00:16:44.150
Your face looks a little different.

00:16:44.234 --> 00:16:46.110
Did you get Botox or fillers?

00:16:49.155 --> 00:16:50.323
I just went on a strict diet.

00:16:50.949 --> 00:16:53.201
You've been in a long-term relationship
with actress Baek Da-yeon,

00:16:53.284 --> 00:16:55.537
but there are rumors
saying that you recently broke up.

00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:57.330
Can you confirm if that's true?

00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:01.459
We're here today

00:17:01.543 --> 00:17:04.629
to talk about the movie
Jobless and in Love.

00:17:04.712 --> 00:17:07.131
So I'm afraid I'll have to pass
on personal questions.

00:17:07.215 --> 00:17:10.802
So you'll admit to the dating rumors
but stay silent about the breakup rumors?

00:17:10.885 --> 00:17:11.928
We'll move on to my question.

00:17:12.011 --> 00:17:13.638
I'm Reporter Wi Jeong-sin
from Sports Eunseong.

00:17:14.973 --> 00:17:18.017
Your character, Hyeon-su, appears to be
completely abandoned by society

00:17:18.101 --> 00:17:20.979
and struggles with self-compassion.

00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:25.441
I imagine you had your own struggles
preparing for this role.

00:17:25.525 --> 00:17:28.695
Can you share how you brought
Hyeon-su to life on screen?

00:17:29.404 --> 00:17:32.574
The first thing I did
after deciding to do this film

00:17:32.657 --> 00:17:34.450
was to cancel my plans with everyone.

00:17:35.076 --> 00:17:36.661
I did that because in the movie,

00:17:36.744 --> 00:17:39.330
Hyeon-su leads a socially isolated life.

00:17:39.414 --> 00:17:42.375
The first thing I wanted to
communicate to the audience

00:17:43.084 --> 00:17:45.169
when I chose to work on this film…

00:17:48.006 --> 00:17:48.840
Hello.

00:17:51.175 --> 00:17:52.302
Hello.

00:17:52.385 --> 00:17:53.761
I'm from Sports Eunseong--

00:17:53.845 --> 00:17:54.762
Reporter Wi Jeong-sin, right?

00:17:56.306 --> 00:17:57.432
Could I get your business card?

00:17:58.016 --> 00:17:58.850
Of course.

00:18:00.435 --> 00:18:01.895
Here you go.

00:18:01.978 --> 00:18:03.855
REPORTER WI JEONG-SIN
SPORTS EUNSEONG

00:18:05.315 --> 00:18:07.066
Thank you for your great question today.

00:18:07.650 --> 00:18:10.695
I wanted to give a thoughtful answer,
so I had to think it through.

00:18:10.778 --> 00:18:13.281
I was afraid my response
wouldn't measure up to the question.

00:18:14.657 --> 00:18:16.242
To be honest, I was kind of scared.

00:18:16.951 --> 00:18:18.328
Was my answer okay?

00:18:19.412 --> 00:18:20.580
Read my article and you'll see.

00:18:21.831 --> 00:18:23.625
The next time you work on a good project,

00:18:24.208 --> 00:18:25.126
can I interview you again?

00:18:25.668 --> 00:18:27.211
You'll be the first person I contact.

00:18:29.464 --> 00:18:30.340
By the way…

00:18:33.301 --> 00:18:35.178
my girlfriend and I are still together.

00:18:35.762 --> 00:18:39.474
Technically, we're somewhere
between dating and breaking up.

00:18:40.433 --> 00:18:43.019
But I really love her,
so I'm going to try harder.

00:18:45.146 --> 00:18:45.980
Is that

00:18:46.856 --> 00:18:48.399
something that's possible just by trying?

00:18:49.859 --> 00:18:50.818
I don't know.

00:18:52.153 --> 00:18:53.154
I'm just going to do my best

00:18:53.863 --> 00:18:55.031
so I don't regret it later.

00:19:03.873 --> 00:19:06.668
Is that something
that's possible just by trying?

00:19:06.751 --> 00:19:07.752
I don't know.

00:19:08.336 --> 00:19:09.629
I'm just going to do my best

00:19:10.296 --> 00:19:11.464
so I don't regret it later.

00:19:14.342 --> 00:19:16.636
MELOMASTER

00:19:22.684 --> 00:19:23.977
All right, let's do this!

00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:25.061
We're all set, Director.

00:19:25.144 --> 00:19:27.271
-We're rolling now.
-Rolling!

00:19:27.855 --> 00:19:28.815
Ready.

00:19:28.898 --> 00:19:29.732
Action.

00:19:31.859 --> 00:19:33.069
Wow.

00:19:33.653 --> 00:19:34.654
It's just as I heard.

00:19:34.737 --> 00:19:37.782
You're not a cop.
You're just a thug with a badge.

00:19:38.783 --> 00:19:40.368
It slipped my mind for a moment.

00:19:40.451 --> 00:19:41.369
What?

00:19:41.452 --> 00:19:43.621
They say you can't fix people.

00:19:43.705 --> 00:19:45.915
But I do.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.585
Nobody's a match for me
when it comes to fixing people.

00:19:55.717 --> 00:19:56.551
Damn it!

00:20:06.644 --> 00:20:07.520
What the hell?

00:20:11.107 --> 00:20:12.025
Come here.

00:20:13.693 --> 00:20:14.694
Cut!

00:20:18.489 --> 00:20:19.365
That was great.

00:20:20.992 --> 00:20:24.579
Mr. Lim, this scene will be in slo-mo,
so try to look cooler.

00:20:24.662 --> 00:20:26.914
You're a bit too upright right now.

00:20:26.998 --> 00:20:28.750
I'll show you how it's done.

00:20:28.833 --> 00:20:30.835
You're avoiding the attack
like this right now.

00:20:30.918 --> 00:20:33.171
I need you to stay in the position,
but sink down lower.

00:20:34.213 --> 00:20:36.549
Don't hit the floor, though.
Stop right before it.

00:20:36.632 --> 00:20:37.884
And then do a front flip.

00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:42.055
Like that.

00:20:42.722 --> 00:20:46.225
Seok-ho, just trust Mr. Lim
and go all in when you attack him.

00:20:47.018 --> 00:20:48.394
-Lower?
-Yes.

00:20:48.478 --> 00:20:50.146
Okay, let's go again!

00:20:50.229 --> 00:20:51.189
-Go for it!
-You can do it!

00:20:51.773 --> 00:20:52.648
You've got this!

00:20:52.732 --> 00:20:54.692
-All right. Ready.
-Ready!

00:20:56.736 --> 00:20:58.154
-Action.
-Action!

00:20:59.113 --> 00:21:00.573
Darn it. No hands, right?

00:21:10.833 --> 00:21:11.959
How was that?

00:21:12.043 --> 00:21:13.211
Was it okay?

00:21:13.795 --> 00:21:14.712
-Cut.
-Cut!

00:21:16.589 --> 00:21:18.716
-Again. Action.
-Action!

00:21:22.845 --> 00:21:24.138
-Cut.
-Cut!

00:21:24.639 --> 00:21:25.848
Are you okay, Mr. Lim?

00:21:25.932 --> 00:21:27.850
Yes, I'm fine.

00:21:27.934 --> 00:21:29.894
Okay, let's try that one more time!

00:21:29.977 --> 00:21:31.229
-Let's try it one more time!
-Hold on.

00:21:31.312 --> 00:21:33.314
-Mr. Lim, get down a bit lower.
-Be careful.

00:21:33.397 --> 00:21:34.273
Hold on.

00:21:35.191 --> 00:21:36.734
-All right. Ready.
-Ready!

00:21:37.819 --> 00:21:39.278
-Action.
-Action!

00:21:39.362 --> 00:21:40.613
-Are you ready?
-Yes.

00:21:44.909 --> 00:21:46.494
Hey, are you okay?

00:21:50.123 --> 00:21:51.332
I don't think this will work.

00:21:56.003 --> 00:21:57.088
Bro, are you sure you're okay?

00:21:58.381 --> 00:21:59.715
I'm fine.

00:22:00.633 --> 00:22:01.676
I just tweaked my back.

00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:03.386
Tweaked, my ass.

00:22:03.469 --> 00:22:05.847
It sounded like
a bamboo branch snapping earlier.

00:22:05.930 --> 00:22:08.349
Jeez, I said I'm fine.

00:22:08.432 --> 00:22:10.518
Hey, that's good.

00:22:10.601 --> 00:22:12.228
Forget it. We'll go with a stunt double.

00:22:12.311 --> 00:22:13.646
What?

00:22:13.729 --> 00:22:15.022
We can't do that.

00:22:15.106 --> 00:22:16.232
There are a lot of
medium close-ups in this scene,

00:22:16.315 --> 00:22:18.192
so Mr. Lim has to do it himself.

00:22:18.818 --> 00:22:20.069
-Mr. Lim.
-Yes?

00:22:20.653 --> 00:22:21.779
You can do this, right?

00:22:24.323 --> 00:22:25.366
Yeah.

00:22:30.246 --> 00:22:32.540
Let's go. Oh man.

00:22:32.623 --> 00:22:33.791
Bro, what was that?

00:22:34.375 --> 00:22:35.251
What do you mean?

00:22:35.334 --> 00:22:36.377
Come on, you're acting weird.

00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:38.171
Does the director have something on you?

00:22:38.254 --> 00:22:39.172
Of course not.

00:22:39.755 --> 00:22:40.965
It's me you're talking about.

00:22:41.048 --> 00:22:44.093
Listen, Kang Pil-gu is me,
and I'm Kang Pil-gu!

00:22:44.177 --> 00:22:46.345
Do you know how important this scene is?

00:22:46.929 --> 00:22:48.055
You…

00:22:49.015 --> 00:22:50.975
-Are we shooting?
-Come out when you're ready!

00:22:51.058 --> 00:22:51.934
All right.

00:22:55.479 --> 00:22:57.273
Something smells fishy, right?

00:22:57.356 --> 00:22:58.357
Yes.

00:23:03.529 --> 00:23:04.405
Do you want some more?

00:23:05.656 --> 00:23:06.490
What's wrong with you?

00:23:15.917 --> 00:23:18.002
ONION

00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:23.507
Is that something
that's possible just by trying?

00:23:24.008 --> 00:23:25.092
I'm just going to do my best

00:23:25.593 --> 00:23:26.761
so I don't regret it later.

00:23:27.595 --> 00:23:29.347
I JUST ARRIVED.
I'M WEARING A PINK DRESS.

00:23:34.977 --> 00:23:38.105
Why are you just picking at your food
and staring into your phone?

00:23:38.606 --> 00:23:39.523
No, I'm not.

00:23:57.875 --> 00:24:00.211
Have some fried chicken, everyone!

00:24:03.256 --> 00:24:05.633
You must be getting hungry by now.

00:24:05.716 --> 00:24:06.717
Please enjoy this together.

00:24:09.804 --> 00:24:11.806
-Thank you!
-We'll definitely enjoy it!

00:24:13.182 --> 00:24:15.309
-This smells amazing!
-I've been craving fried chicken.

00:24:15.393 --> 00:24:17.311
Have some fried chicken, guys!

00:24:19.021 --> 00:24:20.147
This is so good!

00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:23.651
-Anyway, last time…
-Yeah?

00:24:24.151 --> 00:24:25.569
Did you hear that crunch?.

00:24:25.653 --> 00:24:27.154
Right? It's so crispy.

00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:30.199
So, is it good?

00:24:30.283 --> 00:24:32.076
-Yes!
-It's delicious!

00:24:32.159 --> 00:24:33.703
-It's tasty.
-Dip it in the sauce.

00:24:35.371 --> 00:24:36.872
-It's so good.
-You sure can eat.

00:24:36.956 --> 00:24:37.873
It's seriously good.

00:24:40.584 --> 00:24:42.837
Hey, so we meet again.

00:24:44.338 --> 00:24:47.258
-Is the fried chicken good?
-Yes, Mr. Lim. It's really good.

00:24:47.341 --> 00:24:50.636
Come on, there's no need to be so formal.

00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:53.764
What happened to the
"I feel like I already know you" vibe?

00:24:53.848 --> 00:24:56.517
I didn't know any better then.
I'll be careful from now on, Mr. Lim.

00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:57.685
You don't have to be careful!

00:24:57.768 --> 00:24:59.562
Just relax, okay?

00:24:59.645 --> 00:25:01.689
-Don't be so tense.
-I'm relaxed, sir.

00:25:01.772 --> 00:25:03.232
-That's right. Relax.
-Hey, everyone.

00:25:03.316 --> 00:25:04.650
-Hello, sir.
-Hello, sir.

00:25:04.734 --> 00:25:07.069
-Hey, have some fried chicken.
-I've already eaten.

00:25:07.653 --> 00:25:10.614
Mr. Lim, let me introduce you
to our new cast members.

00:25:11.365 --> 00:25:13.367
-This is…
-That's our rookie detective

00:25:13.451 --> 00:25:14.827
at the Gangseo Police Station,
Wi Hong-sin.

00:25:14.910 --> 00:25:16.162
I'm Rookie Detective Wi Hong-sin, sir.

00:25:17.371 --> 00:25:19.874
-The rookie detective?
-Yes.

00:25:19.957 --> 00:25:21.125
Wait, then…

00:25:22.418 --> 00:25:23.377
Who's playing the younger Pil-gu?

00:25:23.461 --> 00:25:24.754
The younger Pil-gu?

00:25:24.837 --> 00:25:27.298
Pil-gu… Where did he go?

00:25:27.381 --> 00:25:28.966
-You auditioned for the younger Pil-gu.
-Yes.

00:25:29.050 --> 00:25:30.259
-Did your roles switch?
-Yes.

00:25:30.343 --> 00:25:31.344
There he comes.

00:25:31.427 --> 00:25:33.262
-Why?
-Mr. Lim, over there.

00:25:33.346 --> 00:25:34.430
Hello, everyone.

00:25:35.056 --> 00:25:37.516
I'm Lim Seon-u, and I'll be playing
Kang Pil-gu's younger self.

00:25:38.642 --> 00:25:39.935
I look forward to working with you.

00:25:44.482 --> 00:25:47.777
I told you not to cast him!

00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:50.321
Why bother asking me
if you were going to choose him anyway?

00:25:50.404 --> 00:25:51.322
Mr. Lim.

00:25:51.405 --> 00:25:53.824
We're on set right now.
There are crew members watching.

00:25:53.908 --> 00:25:55.368
Look, Director.

00:25:55.451 --> 00:25:57.370
If you were going to do
whatever you wanted,

00:25:57.453 --> 00:26:00.289
why did you ask my opinion to begin with?

00:26:00.373 --> 00:26:02.083
I tried to go along with your wish,

00:26:02.166 --> 00:26:04.960
but Wi Hong-sin just didn't resemble you.

00:26:05.044 --> 00:26:06.837
It'd look as if he'd become
a completely different person.

00:26:06.921 --> 00:26:08.923
-It just wouldn't convince the viewers.
-The viewers--

00:26:09.006 --> 00:26:09.924
But luckily,

00:26:10.007 --> 00:26:13.386
Hong-sin was a good fit
for the role of rookie detective.

00:26:13.469 --> 00:26:14.845
Try to be more understanding.

00:26:14.929 --> 00:26:16.222
Good fit or not, he--

00:26:16.305 --> 00:26:17.807
What's your problem
with Lim Seon-u, anyway?

00:26:17.890 --> 00:26:20.935
He'll be playing your younger self,
so you won't even have to act with him.

00:26:21.018 --> 00:26:22.144
I mean,

00:26:22.228 --> 00:26:23.938
it's not that I have a problem with him--

00:26:24.021 --> 00:26:26.565
Look, Mr. Lim.
We have a lot of scenes to shoot today,

00:26:26.649 --> 00:26:28.317
so I have to get ready.
I hope you understand.

00:26:28.401 --> 00:26:31.654
Wait, Director Bak,
you can't just leave like this!

00:26:31.737 --> 00:26:33.447
Bro, have a cold drink.

00:26:36.117 --> 00:26:37.159
You really didn't know?

00:26:37.243 --> 00:26:39.995
I didn't know. I just found out myself.

00:26:40.079 --> 00:26:41.038
Are you sure?

00:26:41.122 --> 00:26:43.124
Yes, I'm sure.

00:26:43.207 --> 00:26:46.085
When I saw Seon-u on set,
I went over to say hello.

00:26:46.168 --> 00:26:48.379
Then he panicked
and told me to keep quiet.

00:26:48.462 --> 00:26:52.508
Turns out, he got the role
he secretly auditioned for!

00:26:54.593 --> 00:26:57.388
Darn it, I never should've done this!

00:26:57.471 --> 00:27:00.808
I should have refused to do Kang Pil-gu
once I made up my mind!

00:27:02.768 --> 00:27:04.270
Tell them to find
another actor for the role.

00:27:04.353 --> 00:27:05.563
Come on, bro.

00:27:05.646 --> 00:27:08.691
Tell the production company and Byeong-gi
that Seon-u is my younger brother

00:27:08.774 --> 00:27:09.859
and to switch him out!

00:27:09.942 --> 00:27:14.071
If we do that, they'll just say,
"Score! What a lucky break!"

00:27:14.155 --> 00:27:15.448
Articles will be leaked,

00:27:15.531 --> 00:27:17.324
and they'll use Seon-u for publicity!

00:27:25.875 --> 00:27:27.460
Seriously.

00:27:27.543 --> 00:27:28.669
Come on, bro.

00:27:29.253 --> 00:27:32.173
Calm down and just keep filming.

00:27:32.256 --> 00:27:34.758
That character doesn't even get
much screen time anyway.

00:27:34.842 --> 00:27:36.302
Just let Seon-u do it.

00:27:36.385 --> 00:27:39.555
Like the director said,
you two don't even share any scenes.

00:27:39.638 --> 00:27:42.433
So I'm just supposed to
act like I don't know him?

00:27:42.516 --> 00:27:43.809
You're an actor, bro.

00:27:43.893 --> 00:27:45.269
A veteran actor, at that!

00:27:45.853 --> 00:27:46.687
Right?

00:27:47.188 --> 00:27:48.022
Right.

00:27:48.105 --> 00:27:50.900
So calm down and take a sip.

00:27:50.983 --> 00:27:52.234
Have a nice cold drink.

00:27:52.318 --> 00:27:53.152
There you go.

00:27:53.819 --> 00:27:54.820
PLEASE TAKE GOOD CARE OF MY MOTHER!

00:28:00.618 --> 00:28:01.702
Thank you for all your hard work.

00:28:01.785 --> 00:28:03.370
-Thank you.
-Enjoy!

00:28:03.454 --> 00:28:05.581
-Thank you.
-Thank you for the drink.

00:28:05.664 --> 00:28:07.708
WE SUPPORT ACTRESS OH MI-RAN
AND THE CREW OF GOOD DETECTIVE KANG PIL-GU

00:28:07.791 --> 00:28:08.751
Thank you so much.

00:28:08.834 --> 00:28:10.252
-Please take good care of my mother.
-Thank you.

00:28:10.336 --> 00:28:11.712
-Thank you.
-Thank you!

00:28:17.384 --> 00:28:18.427
Jeez.

00:28:19.595 --> 00:28:21.597
He's so over the top.

00:28:22.598 --> 00:28:24.934
Why? I think it's nice to see.

00:28:25.434 --> 00:28:27.311
Sending a coffee truck is too much.

00:28:28.145 --> 00:28:29.063
Hold on, we need to pose.

00:28:29.146 --> 00:28:31.357
He's such a sweet guy.

00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:34.443
He's just nice through and through, right?

00:28:34.527 --> 00:28:36.320
Look at him. My gosh.

00:28:37.154 --> 00:28:40.616
"Pil-gu leaps over a heap of scrap metal."

00:28:40.699 --> 00:28:42.576
Hey.

00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:45.788
Do you really think I can leap over
a heap of scrap metal

00:28:45.871 --> 00:28:47.289
with the state of my lower back?

00:28:47.915 --> 00:28:49.375
Tell them to use a stunt double.

00:28:49.458 --> 00:28:51.710
I'm just reading the script.

00:28:53.629 --> 00:28:55.548
Excuse me. Ms. Oh is here.

00:28:55.631 --> 00:28:56.549
Really?

00:28:57.591 --> 00:28:59.009
Ma'am, how are you?

00:28:59.510 --> 00:29:00.386
Hello.

00:29:00.469 --> 00:29:02.763
-Mr. Lee, we meet again.
-Yes, hello.

00:29:03.347 --> 00:29:05.140
Please have this while you get ready.

00:29:05.891 --> 00:29:07.101
We've already had some.

00:29:07.685 --> 00:29:08.519
Right.

00:29:08.602 --> 00:29:09.812
My son prepared it for me.

00:29:13.274 --> 00:29:14.650
How is Ae-suk doing?

00:29:16.402 --> 00:29:18.070
Oh, yes.

00:29:18.153 --> 00:29:20.447
She's… Well…

00:29:20.531 --> 00:29:23.534
You know,
humans are such fickle creatures.

00:29:23.617 --> 00:29:27.121
I'd rather not see anyone
who remembers me from my struggling days.

00:29:27.621 --> 00:29:31.208
Ae-suk probably wouldn't feel the same way
because she was in her prime back then.

00:29:31.292 --> 00:29:34.670
Hyeon-jun, just make sure
we never have to cross paths again.

00:29:37.798 --> 00:29:40.384
-Right, I'll…
-Goodness,

00:29:40.467 --> 00:29:45.139
I can't believe how handsome your son is!

00:29:45.222 --> 00:29:47.433
He looks more like an actor
than most actors do.

00:29:47.516 --> 00:29:49.435
No, not at all.

00:29:49.518 --> 00:29:51.186
Mr. Lim is much more handsome.

00:29:51.270 --> 00:29:52.521
No, I'm not.

00:29:53.272 --> 00:29:56.108
Well, please take good care of my mother.

00:29:56.191 --> 00:29:58.235
I'm going to need
your guidance myself, ma'am.

00:29:59.028 --> 00:30:02.156
Sweetheart, don't call me "ma'am."

00:30:02.239 --> 00:30:04.908
It makes me feel old when you say that.

00:30:07.703 --> 00:30:08.871
Oh, then…

00:30:08.954 --> 00:30:10.581
Call her Mi-ran, then.

00:30:11.165 --> 00:30:13.000
-Mi-ran.
-I like that.

00:30:13.083 --> 00:30:14.084
Got it, Mi-ran.

00:30:19.548 --> 00:30:23.677
Jeez, you're only getting better
at paying lip service.

00:30:23.761 --> 00:30:24.762
How ridiculous.

00:30:26.388 --> 00:30:29.058
"You're even more handsome than an actor!"

00:30:29.141 --> 00:30:30.309
Then you called her Mi-ran.

00:30:30.392 --> 00:30:32.978
I felt embarrassed just listening to you.

00:30:33.479 --> 00:30:35.481
You truly embarrass me.

00:30:35.564 --> 00:30:39.318
That was no different from you
asking me not to call you "bro."

00:30:40.736 --> 00:30:41.945
How's your lower back?

00:30:42.738 --> 00:30:44.698
I just tweaked it, that's all.

00:30:45.324 --> 00:30:46.325
Jeez.

00:30:46.408 --> 00:30:50.871
By the way, why do you want to see Ms. Wi
when there's nothing to talk about?

00:30:50.954 --> 00:30:53.123
I can always
make something up to talk about.

00:30:55.584 --> 00:30:57.169
Is there anything worthy of an exclusive?

00:30:58.087 --> 00:31:00.506
Why don't you just announce
that you're retiring then?

00:31:01.090 --> 00:31:02.966
There's something I need to check

00:31:03.842 --> 00:31:04.843
personally.

00:31:04.927 --> 00:31:08.263
Isn't it possible she sent someone else,
just like we did?

00:31:17.815 --> 00:31:18.649
How have you been?

00:31:20.192 --> 00:31:21.860
Good. It's been a while.

00:31:22.403 --> 00:31:23.237
Yes.

00:31:24.321 --> 00:31:26.490
You could say it's been a while,
or maybe it hasn't.

00:31:26.573 --> 00:31:27.491
What?

00:31:27.574 --> 00:31:28.826
What?

00:31:30.786 --> 00:31:31.662
I mean…

00:31:33.497 --> 00:31:35.082
Right, so…

00:31:35.165 --> 00:31:37.459
You must've been surprised
we called out of the blue.

00:31:38.043 --> 00:31:40.921
Well, newsworthy things
tend to happen out of the blue.

00:31:41.004 --> 00:31:42.297
So why are we here?

00:31:43.674 --> 00:31:44.508
Before we get into that,

00:31:45.217 --> 00:31:46.719
I brought a gift.

00:31:46.802 --> 00:31:48.053
Oh, right.

00:31:48.929 --> 00:31:50.305
Goodness, this is just…

00:31:52.808 --> 00:31:54.268
-This is…
-Here we go.

00:31:54.351 --> 00:31:55.728
And this too.

00:31:56.937 --> 00:31:58.689
This right here…

00:32:00.232 --> 00:32:01.859
GOOD DETECTIVE KANG PIL-GU

00:32:02.443 --> 00:32:03.527
There's also this.

00:32:04.445 --> 00:32:06.238
This is a limited edition.

00:32:06.321 --> 00:32:07.281
And here's this.

00:32:09.283 --> 00:32:10.117
Yes.

00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:17.708
It's the first time in my life.

00:32:18.542 --> 00:32:22.087
I've never liked someone
so unconditionally.

00:32:25.632 --> 00:32:28.302
If she likes me so unconditionally,
what's with the reaction?

00:32:28.385 --> 00:32:32.598
I suppose it'd be awkward to admit
that she's my fan in this setting.

00:32:34.391 --> 00:32:35.559
I understand.

00:32:36.351 --> 00:32:37.644
-What?
-What?

00:32:39.813 --> 00:32:41.231
Never mind.

00:32:42.191 --> 00:32:44.526
You brought Kang Pil-gu merch.

00:32:46.570 --> 00:32:48.113
They're little things,

00:32:48.197 --> 00:32:51.241
but they're practical items
that can come in handy.

00:32:51.325 --> 00:32:53.327
Since Ms. Yun probably doesn't need these,

00:32:54.244 --> 00:32:55.746
why don't you take them all, Ms. Wi?

00:32:56.330 --> 00:32:57.623
Okay. Thank you.

00:32:59.291 --> 00:33:00.417
By the way,

00:33:01.752 --> 00:33:03.837
-what's this?
-You don't know what it is?

00:33:03.921 --> 00:33:06.381
This is Kang Pil-gu's signature item.

00:33:08.467 --> 00:33:10.803
"They say you can't fix people."

00:33:11.929 --> 00:33:12.971
"But…

00:33:13.055 --> 00:33:14.640
I do."

00:33:16.517 --> 00:33:17.559
What are you doing?

00:33:21.396 --> 00:33:22.731
Goodness.

00:33:22.815 --> 00:33:25.317
He never does that.
I don't know what's gotten into him.

00:33:26.652 --> 00:33:28.070
I'm sorry.

00:33:30.113 --> 00:33:33.325
You didn't look too well,
so I thought you could use a laugh.

00:33:34.076 --> 00:33:35.369
I need to use the restroom.

00:33:35.452 --> 00:33:36.829
Yes, of course.

00:33:45.879 --> 00:33:46.880
Hello?

00:33:49.716 --> 00:33:50.634
Hello?

00:33:51.552 --> 00:33:53.679
Oh, you need me to move my car? Of course.

00:33:53.762 --> 00:33:55.597
I'll move it right away.

00:33:58.308 --> 00:33:59.434
But I have the car keys…

00:34:20.330 --> 00:34:21.206
Onion!

00:34:29.006 --> 00:34:31.091
Did you get home safely that night?

00:34:48.692 --> 00:34:49.818
Jeez.

00:34:52.654 --> 00:34:54.740
Wow, look at all these dishes.

00:34:55.449 --> 00:34:56.783
Everything looks fresh.

00:34:58.744 --> 00:35:02.039
So how did King's Back Entertainment
and Purple Line Company

00:35:02.122 --> 00:35:03.415
end up merging?

00:35:03.498 --> 00:35:06.126
As you know, Chairman Lee Dae-ho

00:35:06.209 --> 00:35:09.671
has been investing heavily
in the entertainment industry.

00:35:09.755 --> 00:35:12.049
He saw the value in our company,

00:35:12.132 --> 00:35:15.552
so we're now joining forces
with Purple Line.

00:35:15.636 --> 00:35:19.681
Does that mean Mr. Lee Dae-ho
will take an active role in management?

00:35:19.765 --> 00:35:22.184
No, he has bigger priorities to attend to.

00:35:22.267 --> 00:35:26.188
Why would he bother managing
such a small agency?

00:35:26.271 --> 00:35:29.232
People call Mr. Lee Dae-ho a media mogul,

00:35:29.316 --> 00:35:32.736
but his newspapers make no profit
and are essentially empty shells.

00:35:32.819 --> 00:35:36.281
Do you even know where
the investment funds are coming from?

00:35:40.285 --> 00:35:41.411
No.

00:35:41.995 --> 00:35:43.372
I didn't look into that…

00:35:44.831 --> 00:35:46.833
What do we know about management?

00:35:46.917 --> 00:35:48.752
Management is a job for the experts.

00:35:48.835 --> 00:35:51.463
-We don't know much about that.
-Right, we don't know.

00:35:52.756 --> 00:35:55.467
Then shall we switch up the subject
from business to entertainment?

00:35:56.051 --> 00:35:57.636
Now that the two companies

00:35:57.719 --> 00:35:59.846
representing Lim Hyeon-jun
and Gwon Se-na have merged,

00:35:59.930 --> 00:36:03.266
and since you're both in the same drama,
some wonder if you're dating--

00:36:03.350 --> 00:36:04.518
We're not!

00:36:11.358 --> 00:36:12.734
I mean, it's not true.

00:36:13.318 --> 00:36:17.155
The drama and the merger
are completely unrelated.

00:36:17.239 --> 00:36:19.074
That's a strange assumption to make.

00:36:19.658 --> 00:36:20.993
My goodness, Ms. Yun.

00:36:21.076 --> 00:36:21.952
It's not true.

00:36:27.499 --> 00:36:28.500
Chief.

00:36:32.045 --> 00:36:35.298
Do you know much about Mr. Lee Dae-ho?

00:36:36.883 --> 00:36:39.177
I know enough since he's the one
who signs my paychecks.

00:36:40.846 --> 00:36:41.722
Don't do it.

00:36:45.100 --> 00:36:46.309
Want to get kicked out our department too?

00:36:48.270 --> 00:36:49.104
Of course not.

00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:51.523
All right, then.

00:36:52.107 --> 00:36:53.316
By the way,

00:36:54.067 --> 00:36:55.736
wasn't Lim Hyeon-jun acting weird today?

00:36:57.612 --> 00:36:58.447
I'm not sure.

00:36:58.989 --> 00:37:00.407
I didn't notice anything weird.

00:37:01.158 --> 00:37:02.659
Lim Hyeon-jun and Gwon Se-na.

00:37:03.243 --> 00:37:05.495
Is there really
nothing going on between them?

00:37:06.079 --> 00:37:07.664
He said there wasn't,
so I'm taking his word for it.

00:37:07.748 --> 00:37:09.791
Reporters should approach
with skepticism, not trust!

00:37:09.875 --> 00:37:10.959
Especially without fact-checking!

00:37:12.294 --> 00:37:14.713
I'm sorry. I'll look into it again.

00:37:17.591 --> 00:37:18.717
Get in.

00:37:27.017 --> 00:37:28.894
Something's definitely going on.

00:37:33.565 --> 00:37:34.524
Excuse me.

00:37:35.108 --> 00:37:36.610
Here's the report you wanted.

00:37:42.324 --> 00:37:43.533
Ha Seong-min, Lee Ho-cheol.

00:37:44.367 --> 00:37:45.952
-Come here.
-Okay.

00:38:03.345 --> 00:38:05.639
Did you get home safely that night?

00:38:08.642 --> 00:38:11.478
Is that something
that's possible just by trying?

00:38:11.561 --> 00:38:12.521
I don't know.

00:38:12.604 --> 00:38:13.730
I'm just going to do my best

00:38:14.397 --> 00:38:15.565
so I don't regret it later.

00:38:19.402 --> 00:38:21.321
I was wondering how to respond,

00:38:21.404 --> 00:38:22.948
so it took me a while to reply.

00:38:23.740 --> 00:38:24.741
MELOMASTER
SOULISHERE

00:38:24.825 --> 00:38:28.995
I've been feeling a bit down
ever since that day.

00:38:29.913 --> 00:38:31.331
Your mom's waiting for you.

00:38:32.457 --> 00:38:33.333
Let's go.

00:38:34.376 --> 00:38:36.253
Wait till I get my hands on him…

00:38:56.439 --> 00:38:57.732
"That jerk hit me first!"

00:38:59.651 --> 00:39:00.861
That's not the right tone.

00:39:08.118 --> 00:39:09.536
"That jerk hit me first!"

00:39:11.997 --> 00:39:15.041
"It's not just me.
He bullies and swears at other kids too."

00:39:16.251 --> 00:39:18.670
"I was just trying to stop him
from taking their money."

00:39:25.886 --> 00:39:28.138
Are you saying your nephew,
Kang Pil-gu, is just "anyone"?

00:39:28.722 --> 00:39:29.890
That's disappointing.

00:39:30.974 --> 00:39:32.517
What if I get into the police academy?

00:39:32.601 --> 00:39:34.728
If you get in, I'll eat my hat.

00:39:34.811 --> 00:39:37.814
I can't let you eat your hat,
so I guess I won't become a cop.

00:39:57.876 --> 00:39:58.752
Onion!

00:40:01.504 --> 00:40:03.590
I was wondering how to respond,

00:40:03.673 --> 00:40:05.383
so it took me a while to reply.

00:40:05.467 --> 00:40:08.053
I've been feeling a bit down

00:40:08.595 --> 00:40:11.097
ever since that day.

00:40:11.681 --> 00:40:13.016
Melo… I mean, Jun-gi.

00:40:13.099 --> 00:40:15.310
Hearing about your broken engagement

00:40:15.936 --> 00:40:17.062
made my heart ache.

00:40:17.145 --> 00:40:18.730
What the hell?

00:40:26.571 --> 00:40:27.864
"Broken engagement"?

00:40:29.241 --> 00:40:30.700
That little bastard.

00:40:31.910 --> 00:40:34.663
I can't ease all your pain,

00:40:35.664 --> 00:40:38.917
-Bak Byeong-gi! You bastard!
-but if it'll help even a little,

00:40:39.709 --> 00:40:42.379
-Bak Byeong-gi!
-I'd like to remain friends.

00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:47.968
Bak Byeong-gi!

00:40:49.177 --> 00:40:51.304
What the hell did you say to her?

00:40:51.388 --> 00:40:53.556
A broken engagement? Are you kidding me?

00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:55.475
You told me to end it,

00:40:55.558 --> 00:40:58.895
so I made up a plausible
yet typical and clichéd story!

00:40:59.396 --> 00:41:02.023
"A typical and clichéd story"?

00:41:02.107 --> 00:41:04.276
I was engaged to someone before.

00:41:04.734 --> 00:41:05.568
Opposed the marriage…

00:41:05.652 --> 00:41:06.778
I don't think I'm ready…

00:41:06.861 --> 00:41:07.779
I'm afraid…

00:41:09.864 --> 00:41:11.032
I'll have to say no.

00:41:13.243 --> 00:41:15.245
Why'd you turn me into some guy
whose engagement got called off?

00:41:15.328 --> 00:41:17.622
And to top it off,
I'm still not over my ex-fiancée?

00:41:17.706 --> 00:41:19.082
I'm a totally chill guy!

00:41:19.165 --> 00:41:21.918
I didn't know that woman and Ms. Wi
were one and the same,

00:41:22.002 --> 00:41:23.044
so I was trying to end it!

00:41:23.628 --> 00:41:25.588
Had I known,
I wouldn't have told a romantic story.

00:41:25.672 --> 00:41:27.590
I would've gone with
an open-ended thriller

00:41:27.674 --> 00:41:30.427
or a more unique, mystery-like story!

00:41:30.510 --> 00:41:32.470
-Are you kidding me?
-Hey, that's expensive!

00:41:32.554 --> 00:41:33.722
Hold it.

00:41:42.939 --> 00:41:44.274
What did I just hear?

00:41:44.357 --> 00:41:45.650
Why are you here?

00:41:45.734 --> 00:41:47.027
I forgot Mr. Hwang was here.

00:41:47.110 --> 00:41:49.404
I'll explain why I'm here later.

00:41:51.072 --> 00:41:52.240
What was that all about?

00:41:54.159 --> 00:41:55.076
What woman?

00:41:55.160 --> 00:41:56.411
And what about Ms. Wi?

00:41:57.412 --> 00:41:59.039
And who's this ex-fiancée?

00:41:59.122 --> 00:42:00.123
Bro, were you engaged?

00:42:00.206 --> 00:42:02.959
It's not like that, Mr. Hwang.

00:42:03.460 --> 00:42:06.463
If you'll just let me explain…

00:42:14.429 --> 00:42:16.723
I WAS WONDERING HOW TO RESPOND,
SO IT TOOK ME A WHILE TO REPLY.

00:42:18.975 --> 00:42:20.602
Why isn't he replying again?

00:42:24.606 --> 00:42:25.690
MY LITTLE BROTHER

00:42:27.067 --> 00:42:27.942
What is it?

00:42:28.026 --> 00:42:29.819
Hey, you're coming home early, right?

00:42:29.903 --> 00:42:31.488
-I'm working late. Don't wait up for me.
-What?

00:42:31.571 --> 00:42:32.781
-You're working late? Wait--
-Yeah.

00:42:33.782 --> 00:42:35.700
But I'm making something delicious today!

00:42:36.701 --> 00:42:38.328
How am I going to eat all this?

00:42:40.497 --> 00:42:42.457
Darn it, Wi Jeong-sin!

00:42:45.335 --> 00:42:48.254
GOOD DETECTIVE KANG PIL-GU

00:42:48.338 --> 00:42:49.214
GOOD DETECTIVE KANG PIL-GU

00:42:53.051 --> 00:42:54.219
What's this?

00:42:57.013 --> 00:42:58.223
GOOD DETECTIVE KANG PIL-GU

00:42:58.807 --> 00:43:00.058
There are all sorts of things.

00:43:01.351 --> 00:43:02.185
Hey, a towel.

00:43:02.268 --> 00:43:03.770
GOOD DETECTIVE KANG PIL-GU

00:43:11.694 --> 00:43:12.862
What in the world?

00:43:13.446 --> 00:43:14.322
Here we go.

00:43:20.745 --> 00:43:22.997
Yes, this is good.

00:43:24.040 --> 00:43:26.251
Can't forget the handcuffs.

00:43:36.052 --> 00:43:38.930
A true fan of mine
would totally love this.

00:44:13.006 --> 00:44:13.965
No way.

00:44:15.133 --> 00:44:17.010
"They say you can't fix people."

00:44:17.093 --> 00:44:18.136
"But…

00:44:19.304 --> 00:44:20.555
I do."

00:44:29.647 --> 00:44:31.024
Bro, have you lost your mind?

00:44:31.107 --> 00:44:33.943
How could you meet someone on Onion
in this day and age

00:44:34.027 --> 00:44:35.945
without even knowing who might show up?

00:44:36.029 --> 00:44:37.572
What are you, a child?

00:44:37.655 --> 00:44:39.574
I thought only young actors were at risk

00:44:39.657 --> 00:44:42.410
of getting caught up in
school bullying or dating rumors.

00:44:42.494 --> 00:44:46.289
Man, I never imagined
you'd drop a bombshell like this.

00:44:46.372 --> 00:44:48.166
It's not a bombshell.

00:44:48.249 --> 00:44:50.627
Gosh, they say late starters
really come on strong.

00:44:50.710 --> 00:44:52.212
Were you trying to make up for lost time

00:44:52.295 --> 00:44:53.880
since you couldn't have fun
when you were younger?

00:44:53.963 --> 00:44:56.007
-Mr. Hwang, calm down--
-Stay out of this, Mr. Bak!

00:44:56.090 --> 00:44:59.135
You're no different!
Both of you are so immature.

00:44:59.636 --> 00:45:02.764
You should be grateful
that the woman turned out to be Ms. Wi.

00:45:02.847 --> 00:45:05.308
What would've happened
if you'd met some lowlife?

00:45:06.809 --> 00:45:07.644
Hold on.

00:45:08.186 --> 00:45:09.020
So, you're saying

00:45:09.103 --> 00:45:13.691
when you were grinning
and texting on your phone,

00:45:13.775 --> 00:45:14.943
you were actually on Onion.

00:45:15.527 --> 00:45:17.445
And that woman was Ms. Wi?

00:45:19.405 --> 00:45:20.615
I get it now!

00:45:20.698 --> 00:45:24.577
That's why you wanted to
give her an exclusive story!

00:45:24.661 --> 00:45:26.371
Mr. Hwang, it wasn't like that.

00:45:26.454 --> 00:45:27.539
Hush!

00:45:27.622 --> 00:45:28.915
It wasn't like that, my ass!

00:45:31.167 --> 00:45:32.752
Man, you really fooled me.

00:45:33.253 --> 00:45:34.837
Look at you, bro.

00:45:34.921 --> 00:45:37.715
So, what are your plans now?

00:45:37.799 --> 00:45:38.758
Well…

00:45:39.425 --> 00:45:42.470
I don't really know what to do next.

00:45:42.554 --> 00:45:43.596
Hold on.

00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:44.722
Wait a second.

00:45:44.806 --> 00:45:47.392
Didn't you say Ms. Wi was your fan?

00:45:48.101 --> 00:45:50.853
-Yes.
-Then why'd she give you such a hard time?

00:45:50.937 --> 00:45:51.813
I know, right?

00:45:52.939 --> 00:45:54.357
I don't get it, either.

00:45:57.694 --> 00:45:58.820
The truth is…

00:46:00.613 --> 00:46:02.699
The truth is what?

00:46:02.782 --> 00:46:05.243
It's fine. Tell the truth.

00:46:05.326 --> 00:46:07.537
You said you were a fan of Lim Hyeon-jun.

00:46:07.620 --> 00:46:10.081
I have an acquaintance
who knows Lim Hyeon-jun.

00:46:10.164 --> 00:46:12.500
Would you like to visit the set sometime?

00:46:14.043 --> 00:46:16.337
Do you mean the Kang Pil-gu crew member?

00:46:18.006 --> 00:46:20.425
Right, I already told you about this.

00:46:20.508 --> 00:46:23.219
It's okay. You don't have to do that.

00:46:23.303 --> 00:46:26.764
Is it because
you've stopped being his fan?

00:46:26.848 --> 00:46:27.932
No, it's not that.

00:46:29.809 --> 00:46:31.060
Now that I think about it,

00:46:32.687 --> 00:46:35.356
I think I was fooling myself.

00:46:36.608 --> 00:46:39.319
Someone who's strongest
in front of the bad guys.

00:46:44.449 --> 00:46:48.119
Someone who's soft and caring
to the weak and vulnerable.

00:46:48.661 --> 00:46:50.872
Someone who acts like Superman
and chases down bad guys

00:46:50.955 --> 00:46:53.458
who harass the elderly or children.

00:46:54.626 --> 00:46:56.753
Someone who looks rough
but has a big heart…

00:46:58.588 --> 00:46:59.672
full of tears,

00:47:00.256 --> 00:47:01.090
and loves flowers.

00:47:01.758 --> 00:47:03.718
I think that's the Kang Pil-gu I liked.

00:47:03.801 --> 00:47:05.136
The one I fell for

00:47:05.762 --> 00:47:07.889
was Detective Kang Pil-gu,
driven by justice,

00:47:08.514 --> 00:47:10.224
not the actor Lim Hyeon-jun.

00:47:10.808 --> 00:47:12.810
Go ahead. Say it.

00:47:13.978 --> 00:47:15.355
Can you both leave now?

00:47:15.438 --> 00:47:17.649
I have a shoot tomorrow,
and a ton of work to do.

00:47:17.732 --> 00:47:19.233
-Director Bak.
-Please leave.

00:47:19.317 --> 00:47:20.151
-Director Bak.
-Please go.

00:47:20.234 --> 00:47:21.277
Okay. Follow me out.

00:47:21.361 --> 00:47:23.571
If you won't leave,
I'll help you out the door.

00:47:23.655 --> 00:47:25.615
Jeez, why did you spill so much water?

00:47:25.698 --> 00:47:28.117
Now, please leave.

00:47:28.868 --> 00:47:30.912
Oh, man.

00:47:31.579 --> 00:47:33.122
Jeez.

00:47:34.582 --> 00:47:36.084
Gosh.

00:47:42.340 --> 00:47:44.050
Oh, man.

00:47:45.093 --> 00:47:49.347
Man, I'm so exhausted.

00:47:51.057 --> 00:47:53.643
Gosh, what a long day.

00:47:54.644 --> 00:47:55.978
Too long.

00:48:08.741 --> 00:48:10.159
WI JEONG-SIN

00:48:34.016 --> 00:48:36.144
-Hey, Su-ji.
-Yes, I'm listening.

00:48:36.978 --> 00:48:38.104
It's been a while.

00:48:38.187 --> 00:48:40.773
I've always been here
waiting for you, Hyeon-jun.

00:48:43.192 --> 00:48:45.611
I found a USB,

00:48:45.695 --> 00:48:48.197
and I want to check its contents.

00:48:48.281 --> 00:48:49.240
What do you think?

00:48:49.323 --> 00:48:51.075
If the USB belongs to someone else,

00:48:51.159 --> 00:48:54.954
it's very likely that it contains
personal information of that person.

00:48:55.037 --> 00:48:57.081
Therefore, checking it without permission

00:48:57.165 --> 00:48:59.417
would not be considered ethically right.

00:49:00.668 --> 00:49:02.211
So it's unethical?

00:49:02.295 --> 00:49:03.212
Yes.

00:49:06.632 --> 00:49:08.634
I suppose that's true.

00:49:09.427 --> 00:49:10.261
Right.

00:49:12.972 --> 00:49:16.642
Then is there a moral
and ethical way to look at this?

00:49:17.393 --> 00:49:19.812
Why don't you ask for
the USB owner's permission?

00:49:19.896 --> 00:49:21.272
Are you kidding me?

00:49:21.355 --> 00:49:24.317
You're so rigid,
maybe because you're an AI.

00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:25.735
Thank you for the compliment.

00:49:25.818 --> 00:49:29.489
From now on, I'll provide
even more ethically sound information.

00:49:30.281 --> 00:49:31.157
Right.

00:49:32.325 --> 00:49:34.243
-I should listen to you, Su-ji.
-It's an honor--

00:49:34.327 --> 00:49:35.369
SLIDE TO POWER OFF

00:49:39.707 --> 00:49:42.919
It's not like it'll contain state secrets.

00:49:54.430 --> 00:49:59.477
MY LITTLE BROTHER

00:50:00.978 --> 00:50:02.772
Why the hell isn't she answering?

00:50:04.857 --> 00:50:07.777
Come on, answer your phone!
I came all the way here for you.

00:50:09.362 --> 00:50:12.657
-What reporter doesn't answer her phone?
-The person you are trying to reach…

00:50:12.740 --> 00:50:13.950
How do I even get in?

00:50:15.284 --> 00:50:16.410
Seriously.

00:50:24.919 --> 00:50:26.170
Excuse me.

00:50:26.754 --> 00:50:28.214
Do you happen to know
Reporter Wi Jeong-sin?

00:50:28.297 --> 00:50:29.131
Yes.

00:50:29.841 --> 00:50:31.092
I know her.

00:50:31.175 --> 00:50:32.552
What a relief.

00:50:32.635 --> 00:50:36.639
The thing is, I tried calling her,
but I guess she's busy.

00:50:36.722 --> 00:50:38.558
Would you mind giving this to her?

00:50:39.141 --> 00:50:40.059
I packed her a meal.

00:50:41.811 --> 00:50:44.522
How do you know Ms. Wi?

00:50:44.605 --> 00:50:45.731
I'm her younger brother.

00:50:46.440 --> 00:50:49.819
I'm her one and only
younger brother, Wi Hong-sin.

00:50:50.570 --> 00:50:51.404
Nice to meet you.

00:50:51.487 --> 00:50:53.281
Oh, is that so?

00:50:53.364 --> 00:50:54.282
Yes, sir.

00:50:54.365 --> 00:50:57.118
-Here, give me that. I'll take it to her.
-Thank you.

00:50:57.201 --> 00:50:59.078
Gosh, you've got a good personality.

00:50:59.161 --> 00:51:01.914
I have a great personality,
unlike my sister.

00:51:04.333 --> 00:51:07.128
I didn't know Ms. Wi
had such a handsome brother.

00:51:07.962 --> 00:51:09.547
Are you close with Jeong-sin?

00:51:09.630 --> 00:51:12.508
I guess you could say
I'd like to get close.

00:51:13.426 --> 00:51:14.802
I see.

00:51:15.386 --> 00:51:16.804
May I ask your name?

00:51:16.888 --> 00:51:18.681
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:51:18.764 --> 00:51:19.974
My name is Lee Jae-hyeong.

00:51:20.057 --> 00:51:21.601
-Nice to meet you.
-Yes, sir.

00:51:22.894 --> 00:51:24.061
Nice to meet you.

00:51:24.145 --> 00:51:25.563
My sister's single, you know.

00:51:26.105 --> 00:51:28.858
-Excuse me?
-She was flirting with some guy,

00:51:28.941 --> 00:51:30.401
but I think he turned her down.

00:51:32.069 --> 00:51:33.571
I never asked, though.

00:51:34.155 --> 00:51:35.197
For some reason,

00:51:35.281 --> 00:51:38.200
I got the feeling
it would be good to tell you.

00:51:38.284 --> 00:51:40.119
-See you tomorrow, sir.
-See you.

00:52:03.976 --> 00:52:05.645
I think she's been working harder lately

00:52:05.728 --> 00:52:09.482
to get over that guy who dumped her.

00:52:09.565 --> 00:52:11.150
She's never been through a proper breakup,

00:52:11.233 --> 00:52:14.236
so she might be bottling up
everything inside.

00:52:53.651 --> 00:52:54.485
I'm going back to Korea.

00:52:54.568 --> 00:52:56.696
I'm sorry that I'm leaving
when you're like this.

00:52:57.363 --> 00:52:59.782
Forget about everything
and focus on your treatment.

00:53:01.367 --> 00:53:02.368
Hwa-yeong…

00:53:13.796 --> 00:53:16.215
WI JEONG-SIN

00:53:29.729 --> 00:53:31.981
When should I return this?

00:53:53.878 --> 00:53:54.712
Damn it.

00:54:19.862 --> 00:54:21.781
Jeong-sin, work hard
and make lots of money!

00:54:31.540 --> 00:54:34.043
SPORTS EUNSEONG

00:54:35.336 --> 00:54:37.713
Everyone else left work hours ago.

00:54:38.839 --> 00:54:39.965
Why are you still here?

00:54:40.883 --> 00:54:41.717
Mr. Lee.

00:54:43.177 --> 00:54:44.261
I had a lot of work.

00:54:44.345 --> 00:54:46.597
Get in. I'll give you a ride.

00:54:56.315 --> 00:54:58.150
I thought you were taking me home.

00:54:59.235 --> 00:55:00.611
I never said I was taking you home.

00:55:04.740 --> 00:55:05.991
Seriously though,

00:55:06.075 --> 00:55:09.370
are you sure you won't regret
missing out on a catch like me?

00:55:11.080 --> 00:55:11.914
The truth is,

00:55:13.666 --> 00:55:15.251
there's someone I like.

00:55:18.170 --> 00:55:19.046
Does that person

00:55:19.922 --> 00:55:20.798
like you too?

00:55:24.593 --> 00:55:27.471
Seeing you can't answer,
I'll take that as a no.

00:55:29.473 --> 00:55:31.058
Doesn't that mean I have a chance?

00:55:32.518 --> 00:55:34.812
Forget about that guy already

00:55:34.895 --> 00:55:35.771
and come to me.

00:55:36.772 --> 00:55:38.941
I'm right here in front of you.

00:55:39.024 --> 00:55:40.484
I've always been here for you.

00:55:41.485 --> 00:55:43.028
And I'm still waiting for you.

00:55:50.828 --> 00:55:51.662
I'm curious.

00:55:52.371 --> 00:55:54.665
How do you come up with lines like that?

00:55:55.916 --> 00:55:57.251
You really seem like a player.

00:56:04.341 --> 00:56:05.467
Jeez.

00:56:07.303 --> 00:56:08.804
Seriously.

00:56:25.779 --> 00:56:28.282
The person you are trying to reach…

00:56:42.713 --> 00:56:44.006
The person you are trying to reach…

00:56:44.089 --> 00:56:47.343
Gosh, what reporter
doesn't answer her phone?

00:57:04.860 --> 00:57:06.153
The person you are trying to reach…

00:57:40.896 --> 00:57:42.439
Thank you for the ride home.

00:57:43.023 --> 00:57:45.317
Why do you have so many bags?

00:57:45.859 --> 00:57:46.986
They're just my stuff.

00:57:47.987 --> 00:57:48.946
Drive home safely, Mr. Lee.

00:57:49.822 --> 00:57:50.698
Okay.

00:57:51.865 --> 00:57:53.784
Thank goodness it's the weekend tomorrow.

00:57:53.867 --> 00:57:54.702
Right?

00:57:58.789 --> 00:58:00.124
-Are you kidding me?
-Sleep well.

00:58:02.876 --> 00:58:04.545
-And sleep in tomorrow.
-Seriously?

00:58:05.170 --> 00:58:06.005
Hey, it's Kang Pil-gu!

00:58:20.185 --> 00:58:22.313
Hey, go ask him.

00:58:24.523 --> 00:58:25.357
Excuse me.

00:58:25.899 --> 00:58:26.942
Are you Kang Pil-gu?

00:59:14.198 --> 00:59:16.158
I saw her with another man.

00:59:16.658 --> 00:59:19.244
But why does that bother me so much?

00:59:19.328 --> 00:59:20.621
You like Wi Jeong-sin, don't you?

00:59:21.080 --> 00:59:22.956
We're on the same team now.

00:59:23.040 --> 00:59:26.043
I'll do everything in my power
to send her to the set of Kang Pil-gu.

00:59:26.126 --> 00:59:28.962
Bro, why did you call Ms. Wi over here?

00:59:29.046 --> 00:59:30.798
What if she runs into Director Bak?

00:59:30.881 --> 00:59:32.174
Mr. Lim! Ms. Wi is here!

00:59:32.257 --> 00:59:33.926
Damn it. Run!

00:59:34.593 --> 00:59:36.261
Why are you so dense?

00:59:36.345 --> 00:59:38.263
Do you really need me
to spell it out for you?

00:59:39.098 --> 00:59:40.849
I'm Melomaster.

00:59:46.146 --> 00:59:48.148
