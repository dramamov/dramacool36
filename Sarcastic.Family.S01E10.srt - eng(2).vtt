00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:15.800
I'm right here.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.879
I see you.

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:18.599
Why else would I walk around?

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:21.639
You three standing here

00:02:21.639 --> 00:02:22.599
kind of look like that

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:23.759
S

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.039
SHE

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:27.280
SOS

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.240
You're so funny.

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:32.639
You're really funny.

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:33.520
Lili

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:35.039
Sorry about that.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.800
About this wedding,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.319
I might have to miss it.

00:02:40.719 --> 00:02:41.159
Let's go.

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:46.039
Let's head out.

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:06.759
In your mouth,

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.800
mumbling and stuffed full.

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.840
Still shouting,

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:11.759
"I'm going to tear you apart!"

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:13.199
And throw you in the fryer.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:15.560
Dreaming of something tasty?

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.360
I'm in your dream.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.479
You're in my pot.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:35.319
What are you doing?

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:39.280
My douzhi.

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:41.560
Douzhi, douzhi.

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.680
Douzhi.

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:43.280
It's gone sour.

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:44.800
That's just how it tastes.

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.520
It.

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:48.080
Drink some water.

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:49.280
What a shame.

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:55.719
Here.

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:09.680
Lili's not happy.

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:11.280
Is she?

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:16.399
She's mad at you.

00:04:17.439 --> 00:04:18.319
It's her period.

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.360
You're the one on your period.

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:24.000
You all—

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.600
Don't—don't mind him.

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.240
Your whole company is on their period.

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:29.040
Well,

00:04:29.399 --> 00:04:30.879
She was fine before bed last night.

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:31.720
What happened?

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:34.199
I had a nightmare last night.

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.600
I dreamed we held

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.079
a huge, grand wedding.

00:04:40.399 --> 00:04:41.199
That's great!

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:42.759
We can't put this off.

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.040
A lot of elderly people,

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.920
when they get older,

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:45.639
leave just like that.

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:46.759
Dad, dad—

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.959
Right now,

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:50.759
don't play the emotional card.

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:51.199
No,

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.720
I mean my old classmates.

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:53.199
If they pass away,

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:54.639
I won't get my wedding cash gift back.

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:55.439
It's fine.

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:56.439
When you're gone,

00:04:56.639 --> 00:04:57.759
we can make some money.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:04:59.759
I get it.

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:01.240
It's just Dad pushing us.

00:05:01.399 --> 00:05:02.680
That's why Lili's so anxious.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.680
Keeps having dreams.

00:05:04.519 --> 00:05:05.560
No,

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:07.040
About this,

00:05:07.079 --> 00:05:08.920
Lili and I agreed

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:09.920
not to have a wedding.

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.240
Skip all those unnecessary formalities.

00:05:12.319 --> 00:05:13.160
And old customs.

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:14.000
That's settled.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:14.720
Let's not—let's drop it.

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:15.160
Drop it.

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:16.360
Um—

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:17.959
Is that okay, Lili?

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:20.639
I'm full.

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:21.399
I'm off to work.

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:25.040
Wait—

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:26.000
Don't go.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.920
Wait for me.

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:28.879
Stop pushing.

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:30.040
Why do you keep pushing?

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:34.199
It's—it's my issue.

00:05:35.519 --> 00:05:35.959
Here.

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:36.959
Eat.

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:40.480
Extra salt, extra oil.

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:41.639
That's what makes it tasty.

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:42.319
Let me tell you—

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:43.800
Why are you suddenly so nice to me?

00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:49.600
Have a bottle of baijiu.

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:50.319
Clear your head.

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.000
Why drink baijiu so early?

00:05:54.839 --> 00:05:56.160
I'm just curious.

00:05:56.199 --> 00:05:57.079
Just curious, really.

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:57.759
Let me ask—

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.160
For a funeral for the elderly,

00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:02.439
how much do the family get?

00:06:09.079 --> 00:06:10.519
Let me help you analyze this.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.399
So you want to have a wedding,

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:14.279
but your husband doesn't want one.

00:06:15.959 --> 00:06:17.199
Scumbag.

00:06:17.959 --> 00:06:19.120
No.

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.920
Because I was the one who firmly said

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:23.199
I didn't want a wedding.

00:06:23.439 --> 00:06:24.800
You've got me all confused.

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:26.199
So is it you who doesn't want it,

00:06:26.199 --> 00:06:27.120
or is it him who doesn't want it?

00:06:27.519 --> 00:06:29.319
Turns out I didn't want it.

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:31.560
Now it's him who doesn't want it.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.319
Still a scumbag.

00:06:34.839 --> 00:06:36.399
That's not really fair.

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:38.399
Back then, I didn't want a wedding

00:06:38.399 --> 00:06:39.480
because I thought

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:40.839
two people being together

00:06:40.879 --> 00:06:43.000
didn't need such a big ceremony.

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:46.439
Lili,

00:06:46.839 --> 00:06:48.759
you really spoke my mind.

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.000
It's not that absolute.

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:53.279
Because now

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:54.959
I actually want a wedding too.

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.040
You're just being dramatic.

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:58.759
You've matured.

00:06:59.079 --> 00:06:59.519
You know

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:00.879
love is precious,

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:01.839
but marriage

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:03.519
is even more valuable.

00:07:03.959 --> 00:07:05.199
Take my advice.

00:07:05.639 --> 00:07:07.519
We have to follow the proper steps.

00:07:07.759 --> 00:07:09.199
If you don't hold a banquet,

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:10.160
your marriage

00:07:10.759 --> 00:07:11.399
won't last long.

00:07:12.079 --> 00:07:13.079
So my husband,

00:07:13.079 --> 00:07:15.160
why doesn't he want a wedding?

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:16.920
He's afraid of spending money.

00:07:17.879 --> 00:07:19.079
That can't be it.

00:07:19.519 --> 00:07:20.600
He just thinks it's a hassle.

00:07:21.759 --> 00:07:22.160
He also...

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:23.240
You two,

00:07:23.439 --> 00:07:24.600
have lived all these years

00:07:25.279 --> 00:07:26.920
and still don't understand men.

00:07:27.879 --> 00:07:29.759
If a man doesn't want a wedding,

00:07:29.879 --> 00:07:32.040
there's only one reason.

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:33.800
He doesn't love you enough.

00:07:34.279 --> 00:07:35.439
He still has

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:37.879
other thoughts in his heart.

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:43.759
Other thoughts.

00:07:45.959 --> 00:07:48.079
University for the Elderly fitness class

00:07:48.079 --> 00:07:50.639
Five hundred per person, buy one get one free.

00:07:56.319 --> 00:07:56.839
In-law,

00:07:57.199 --> 00:07:58.720
the University for the Elderly has a fitness class.

00:07:58.839 --> 00:07:59.920
It's perfect for you.

00:08:00.199 --> 00:08:01.000
Are you interested?

00:08:01.199 --> 00:08:01.920
How much will you pay me?

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:04.399
Why would you get paid to attend?

00:08:04.759 --> 00:08:05.920
So how much does he want?

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:07.560
Not much.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.079
Just pay five hundred.

00:08:09.439 --> 00:08:10.079
That's a good deal.

00:08:10.519 --> 00:08:12.519
But I don't have any money on my phone now.

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:14.000
With our relationship,

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.279
I'll lend it to you first.

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:18.639
How about this then:

00:08:18.839 --> 00:08:20.920
You lend me five hundred for the registration,

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:23.319
then send me another five hundred for living expenses.

00:08:23.439 --> 00:08:24.879
I'll pay you back both tomorrow.

00:08:25.519 --> 00:08:26.360
Alright.

00:08:29.839 --> 00:08:30.839
That works too.

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:33.720
Anyway, we get a free class out of it.

00:08:33.879 --> 00:08:35.360
I'm such a clever old fox.

00:08:37.759 --> 00:08:39.080
Pay me back one thousand tomorrow.

00:08:43.159 --> 00:08:43.679
You know what,

00:08:43.679 --> 00:08:45.039
I was really lucky that day.

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:48.440
Just watch that young guy cast his line,

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:49.759
and with a flick of his wrist,

00:08:49.759 --> 00:08:51.480
he caught over two jin of carp.

00:08:51.679 --> 00:08:53.360
That made the little grandson so happy.

00:08:54.559 --> 00:08:55.320
He'll come again next week.

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:56.080
Where's Cai Xiaoying?

00:09:01.879 --> 00:09:03.480
Lao Meng, I'm not coming to class anymore.

00:09:03.799 --> 00:09:05.279
My five hundred tuition fee,

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:06.799
you go ask the school for a refund.

00:09:07.039 --> 00:09:08.480
And the five hundred you lent me,

00:09:08.639 --> 00:09:10.240
I used it to help pay your tuition.

00:09:10.279 --> 00:09:11.159
I don't owe you anymore.

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:15.320
So that's one thousand gone, just like that.

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:19.320
Here they come, everyone's here.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:22.639
Where's little Cai?

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:24.480
I already talked to her.

00:09:25.639 --> 00:09:26.840
Tuition is five hundred.

00:09:26.919 --> 00:09:27.919
Buy one get one free.

00:09:28.159 --> 00:09:29.320
It's perfect for us to split.

00:09:29.519 --> 00:09:29.799
No.

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:32.639
You already talked to her.

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:35.320
Pay me back one thousand tomorrow.

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:36.960
Pay me back one thousand tomorrow.

00:09:47.039 --> 00:09:47.600
Lao Gao

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:49.879
Let's split that class together.

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:51.399
I'll transfer two hundred fifty to you.

00:09:54.159 --> 00:09:54.879
Alright.

00:09:55.279 --> 00:09:56.600
I'll go sign up right now.

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:02.279
Lao Meng,

00:10:02.799 --> 00:10:04.039
trying to outsmart me.

00:10:05.799 --> 00:10:08.120
When God spread wisdom on earth,

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:11.159
why did He shield only you from it?

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:14.720
Didn't come.

00:10:15.559 --> 00:10:16.879
This woman—

00:10:17.799 --> 00:10:19.639
Her heart must be made of coal briquettes.

00:10:19.639 --> 00:10:21.320
So scheming.

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:23.879
Class, class—

00:10:23.879 --> 00:10:24.840
Let's quiet down, please.

00:10:25.159 --> 00:10:27.559
Today's senior fitness class

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:28.879
is mainly to

00:10:28.879 --> 00:10:30.279
help all the uncles and aunties

00:10:30.679 --> 00:10:32.480
pay attention to your health.

00:10:32.559 --> 00:10:33.080
Alright?

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:35.440
Speaking of which,

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:37.720
I regret to share some news.

00:10:38.159 --> 00:10:39.120
Last week,

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:41.320
Eighty-six-year-old Grandpa Huang

00:10:41.799 --> 00:10:42.559
passed away.

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:44.679
How did he go?

00:10:45.279 --> 00:10:46.519
It was very sudden.

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:48.480
But he felt no pain at all.

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:50.960
Who would've thought

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:52.080
there's a University for the Elderly

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:53.639
with a co-ed tango class.

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:55.080
So Lao Huang

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:56.080
was spinning and jumping around,

00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:57.200
turning back every two steps, and then

00:10:57.639 --> 00:10:58.519
he transferred schools.

00:10:59.080 --> 00:10:59.679
Transferred?

00:10:59.679 --> 00:11:00.039
Teacher,

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:01.919
give me that university's address.

00:11:02.039 --> 00:11:03.320
I'll go scold Lao Huang right now.

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:04.519
He betrayed us for beauty—too much!

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:05.759
Meng—Uncle Meng,

00:11:06.279 --> 00:11:06.679
Uncle Meng,

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:08.879
I heard that

00:11:09.039 --> 00:11:10.200
that class is like this:

00:11:10.399 --> 00:11:12.279
the male-to-female ratio is twenty to one.

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:14.039
Sixty grandpas

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:15.559
with three aunties

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:16.440
doing tango.

00:11:17.159 --> 00:11:18.240
Those aunties must be exhausted.

00:11:18.639 --> 00:11:19.879
On the first day,

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:21.080
they all dropped out.

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:22.080
Now that class

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:23.320
seems to have a new name—

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:25.679
"Sixty Plus Brother Boy Band Dance."

00:11:30.639 --> 00:11:32.159
No, Uncle Meng,

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:32.919
he's not going anymore.

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:35.159
Lao Huang changed his ways.

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:37.320
So I don't need to scold him, right?

00:11:39.159 --> 00:11:39.679
Alright.

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:41.480
Let's stick to our usual rules.

00:11:41.759 --> 00:11:43.159
First, elect a class leader.

00:11:43.919 --> 00:11:45.399
Then organize activities.

00:11:45.759 --> 00:11:47.200
Anyone want to volunteer?

00:11:47.639 --> 00:11:48.879
Me, me!

00:11:49.039 --> 00:11:50.320
I'm volunteering.

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:51.840
Everyone knows me well.

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:52.639
You all know me.

00:11:52.679 --> 00:11:53.360
Inside and out.

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:54.840
And I really want to be class leader.

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:56.159
I'll serve everyone well.

00:11:56.159 --> 00:11:56.679
Alright?

00:11:56.679 --> 00:11:57.320
Good, good!

00:11:57.679 --> 00:11:58.519
Good, good!

00:11:59.759 --> 00:12:00.600
More than happy to.

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:01.639
Yes, yes.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:02.519
Teacher Li,

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:03.440
Sorry,

00:12:03.919 --> 00:12:04.759
I'm late.

00:12:05.879 --> 00:12:06.879
I'm late.

00:12:07.159 --> 00:12:08.080
Come in quickly, come in!

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:08.639
Come, come.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:10.919
Sit, sit—Lao Liang, sit down.

00:12:11.759 --> 00:12:12.200
Come.

00:12:13.279 --> 00:12:13.879
Come, come.

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:14.559
Hurry up, hurry up.

00:12:15.519 --> 00:12:16.840
Let me introduce someone.

00:12:16.919 --> 00:12:17.799
This classmate

00:12:17.919 --> 00:12:20.480
just transferred from Tongzhou.

00:12:20.559 --> 00:12:21.159
Lao Liang.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:22.440
Come on.

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:22.960
Hello, everyone.

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:23.519
Sit here.

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:26.440
Whose daughter is this student?

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:28.399
Pretty and kind, too.

00:12:28.399 --> 00:12:29.159
Watch your words.

00:12:29.159 --> 00:12:30.279
You're making her uncomfortable.

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:31.879
Exactly.

00:12:32.279 --> 00:12:32.759
Teacher,

00:12:33.559 --> 00:12:35.879
I heard you're electing a class leader?

00:12:35.879 --> 00:12:36.399
Yes, yes.

00:12:36.879 --> 00:12:38.039
Can I try for it?

00:12:38.039 --> 00:12:38.679
No problem.

00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:40.399
We elect our leader democratically.

00:12:40.399 --> 00:12:41.360
Why should she?

00:12:41.519 --> 00:12:42.919
She just got here, knows nothing.

00:12:42.919 --> 00:12:43.639
Why should she?

00:12:43.759 --> 00:12:44.480
Yeah.

00:12:44.559 --> 00:12:45.799
Who are you, anyway?

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:47.799
No—

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:48.399
This—

00:12:48.879 --> 00:12:50.399
is a welcome gift for everyone.

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:52.080
Everyone gets one.

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:53.559
Brother Liang,

00:12:53.559 --> 00:12:54.600
You just show up,

00:12:54.639 --> 00:12:55.759
what did you bring?

00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:56.759
Everyone gets one.

00:12:56.759 --> 00:12:57.720
It's all organic.

00:12:57.759 --> 00:12:58.399
Don't grab.

00:13:00.879 --> 00:13:01.200
No—

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:01.879
Don't grab, don't grab.

00:13:01.879 --> 00:13:04.200
Isn't this blatant bribery?

00:13:04.879 --> 00:13:06.559
It's making the classroom chaotic.

00:13:06.559 --> 00:13:06.879
Yes.

00:13:06.879 --> 00:13:07.919
Why is it so noisy?

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:09.159
Class leader,

00:13:09.279 --> 00:13:09.759
Leader,

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:11.919
organize everyone, keep order.

00:13:11.919 --> 00:13:13.000
Teacher's stepping out for a bit.

00:13:13.039 --> 00:13:13.639
Alright.

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:16.440
Everyone, be careful.

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:17.039
Um—

00:13:17.039 --> 00:13:17.639
Uncle Meng,

00:13:17.919 --> 00:13:19.159
work with the class leader.

00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:20.000
Everyone gets one.

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:22.879
You took two bags!

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:24.639
No, in front of eggs,

00:13:24.639 --> 00:13:26.559
does your dignity collapse so easily?

00:13:37.639 --> 00:13:38.600
Ms. Li Lili

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.399
You have quite a few flaws

00:13:40.799 --> 00:13:41.879
Your eyesight isn't great

00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:44.159
Among thousands of handsome men

00:13:44.559 --> 00:13:46.720
you only saw me, the odd one out

00:13:47.639 --> 00:13:49.000
You have no control over your diet

00:13:49.399 --> 00:13:50.399
Every time I come home

00:13:50.679 --> 00:13:52.919
you always prepare a big meal for me

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.080
You have no concept of money

00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:57.799
The salary I hand over

00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.279
you never take it

00:14:00.159 --> 00:14:01.360
Sometimes I wonder

00:14:01.879 --> 00:14:04.000
did you blow up a nursing home in your past life

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:05.960
so heaven punished you

00:14:06.519 --> 00:14:07.720
by making you, this angel

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:09.399
spend the rest of your life with me

00:14:10.759 --> 00:14:11.759
Ms. Li Lili

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:13.159
I swear

00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:15.159
from this day forward

00:14:15.639 --> 00:14:16.759
I will love you

00:14:18.759 --> 00:14:19.399
And

00:14:19.919 --> 00:14:21.120
I will prove it

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:22.440
with my actions

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:24.480
Mr. Meng Hang

00:14:25.559 --> 00:14:27.320
I need to correct you on one thing

00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:30.120
I'm not an angel sent from above

00:14:30.679 --> 00:14:33.240
I'm an S-Star Person from the Fairy Constellation

00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:08.840
How did you sleep last night

00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:12.480
Not so well

00:15:13.879 --> 00:15:14.840
I'm off to work

00:15:16.399 --> 00:15:16.960
Your food

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:18.360
Take it and eat on the way

00:15:22.399 --> 00:15:24.080
She must've dreamed last night

00:15:24.519 --> 00:15:25.720
dreamed I did something again

00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:26.679
that let her down

00:15:26.879 --> 00:15:27.679
Well, I...

00:15:27.679 --> 00:15:28.519
What should I do

00:15:28.639 --> 00:15:29.679
I can't go into her dreams

00:15:29.679 --> 00:15:30.639
and argue with her there

00:15:32.399 --> 00:15:33.440
I have a way to handle this

00:15:33.919 --> 00:15:34.960
Would you like to talk to her

00:15:35.039 --> 00:15:35.679
Don't worry about it

00:15:35.759 --> 00:15:36.600
Leave it to me

00:15:36.919 --> 00:15:37.720
Hurry up and eat

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:39.120
I'm not eating, I'm off to work

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:42.320
No, take it and eat on the way

00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:00.759
Pretty good-looking

00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:03.480
This old man

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:05.080
Dressed like this, he's not proper

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.200
I remember Meng Hang had a pair of overalls

00:17:09.799 --> 00:17:10.640
Really handsome

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:17.880
How is it

00:17:20.279 --> 00:17:21.519
This outfit makes you look young

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:22.839
Looks like you're in your thirties

00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:25.920
Super handsome

00:17:27.039 --> 00:17:28.039
Like a three-year-old

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:28.759
giant baby

00:17:34.279 --> 00:17:35.240
These cards

00:17:35.519 --> 00:17:36.799
He needs to draw three

00:17:37.519 --> 00:17:39.279
One for your present

00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:41.279
One for your past

00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:42.200
One

00:17:42.279 --> 00:17:43.359
for your future

00:17:43.359 --> 00:17:45.680
You played all this when you were young

00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:47.319
Exactly

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:50.480
Isn't this just a fortune-teller

00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:52.680
Don't talk nonsense if you don't know

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.240
These are Tarot cards

00:17:54.519 --> 00:17:55.079
They're foreign

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:55.920
for fortune-telling

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.079
That's just worshipping foreign stuff

00:17:57.119 --> 00:17:57.880
Seriously

00:17:59.319 --> 00:17:59.880
Lao Liang

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:00.960
Read my fortune

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:02.000
See where

00:18:02.119 --> 00:18:03.559
I can find my sweet love

00:18:04.599 --> 00:18:05.759
You don't need cards for that

00:18:05.759 --> 00:18:06.960
That urology ward

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:07.599
That diabetes

00:18:07.599 --> 00:18:08.519
All those old men

00:18:08.559 --> 00:18:08.960
Right

00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:13.079
Aren't you annoying

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:14.839
It's bad luck running into you today

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:15.480
So annoying

00:18:15.559 --> 00:18:16.039
Fine, read it

00:18:16.079 --> 00:18:17.119
It'll be the same result anyway

00:18:17.319 --> 00:18:18.680
What's it got to do with me

00:18:18.839 --> 00:18:19.359
Uncle Meng

00:18:19.599 --> 00:18:20.839
Let me check for you

00:18:21.519 --> 00:18:23.240
Can you really predict something special

00:18:26.559 --> 00:18:28.039
The Hermit card

00:18:31.319 --> 00:18:32.519
The Temperance card

00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:36.839
The Knight of Wands

00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:38.160
It's reversed too

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:40.839
Your brow looks dark

00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:41.839
Today

00:18:42.279 --> 00:18:43.279
you might face a disaster

00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:44.880
I advise you

00:18:45.119 --> 00:18:47.000
to be careful with your words and actions

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:48.920
Fortune-telling

00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:50.559
You even mix East and West

00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:52.079
I don't buy your nonsense

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:53.640
Lao Gao, let's go

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:54.160
Let's go

00:18:54.279 --> 00:18:54.799
Seriously

00:18:56.319 --> 00:18:56.720
This

00:18:57.960 --> 00:18:59.079
What's going on here

00:18:59.359 --> 00:18:59.920
My back

00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:00.319
Quick, quick

00:19:00.319 --> 00:19:01.920
Sit, sit, sit

00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:02.400
Slow down, slow down

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:03.480
That's amazing

00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:04.920
I told you

00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:06.880
I really pulled it

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:07.400
Read my fortune

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:08.440
I really can't move

00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:09.200
Almost

00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:10.519
This

00:19:10.519 --> 00:19:11.519
Read mine first

00:19:12.039 --> 00:19:12.880
Convinced now

00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:15.160
My back's convinced

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:16.519
But I'm not convinced by him

00:19:19.559 --> 00:19:20.839
The school was supposed to

00:19:21.079 --> 00:19:22.640
call your son

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:25.240
but Meng was busy with a client

00:19:25.839 --> 00:19:28.160
so I had to come take care of you

00:19:28.599 --> 00:19:29.000
No

00:19:29.079 --> 00:19:30.759
You were supposed to push me

00:19:31.039 --> 00:19:32.000
Now it's me

00:19:32.079 --> 00:19:32.920
doing it myself

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:34.759
No

00:19:34.759 --> 00:19:36.039
What's this rope for

00:19:37.599 --> 00:19:38.960
So you don't get lost

00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:42.880
That's humiliating

00:19:43.799 --> 00:19:45.440
This is all Lao Liang's fault

00:19:46.519 --> 00:19:47.279
Your mouth is vicious

00:19:47.559 --> 00:19:48.240
Go online

00:19:48.319 --> 00:19:49.279
and troll him

00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:50.759
At your age

00:19:51.079 --> 00:19:53.119
still playing at school bullying

00:19:53.599 --> 00:19:54.359
ruining your reputation late in life

00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:56.079
Help me look into him

00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:56.759
I'm not going

00:19:58.519 --> 00:19:59.759
Do you believe me

00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:01.000
Do you believe me

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:12.400
What are you investigating?

00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:15.880
Lao Liang is treating classmates to dinner.

00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:16.920
Go keep an eye on it.

00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:17.720
Help me dig for info.

00:20:18.039 --> 00:20:19.400
See if you can uncover any dirt.

00:20:19.519 --> 00:20:20.559
If you find something,

00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:23.599
I'll make sure he can't leave after school.

00:20:24.319 --> 00:20:25.319
You want to start a fight?

00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:26.720
Even harsher than that.

00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:28.319
Report him to the teacher.

00:20:30.079 --> 00:20:30.799
Alright.

00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:57.039
Auntie Hua,

00:20:58.960 --> 00:20:59.720
Look,

00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:01.119
between me and Lao Liang,

00:21:01.359 --> 00:21:02.480
who's younger?

00:21:02.559 --> 00:21:04.079
Of course, Lao Liang is younger.

00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:05.200
Just look at his skin.

00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:06.680
Hey, Lao Liang,

00:21:07.119 --> 00:21:08.920
how do you take care of yourself?

00:21:09.319 --> 00:21:09.799
Yeah,

00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:11.119
look at his health.

00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:12.400
He's fitter than the young ones.

00:21:15.759 --> 00:21:16.759
Actually,

00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:19.480
my son told me not to say.

00:21:20.079 --> 00:21:20.759
Go ahead, say it.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:21.920
Everyone, keep eating.

00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:23.559
Playing hard to get.

00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:24.279
Lao Liang,

00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:25.640
we're all

00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:27.279
classmates here.

00:21:27.319 --> 00:21:28.680
Don't keep it all to yourself.

00:21:28.759 --> 00:21:30.559
Exactly, exactly.

00:21:30.559 --> 00:21:31.200
Tell us.

00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:31.640
Come on, share.

00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:32.359
Share, share.

00:21:32.559 --> 00:21:33.319
Let us in on it.

00:21:34.119 --> 00:21:35.119
No one else, go ahead.

00:21:35.279 --> 00:21:35.720
Tell us.

00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:39.640
I'll only tell you guys.

00:21:40.279 --> 00:21:41.480
See this bracelet?

00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:44.039
White agate.

00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:50.400
My son

00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:51.720
works in mining.

00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:52.799
Two years ago,

00:21:52.799 --> 00:21:54.359
he opened a meteorite mine.

00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:55.559
Inside,

00:21:55.759 --> 00:21:57.039
he found this crystal.

00:21:57.839 --> 00:21:58.640
Thought it looked nice,

00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:00.279
so he made me this bracelet.

00:22:00.519 --> 00:22:01.319
Unexpectedly,

00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:03.759
since I started wearing it,

00:22:04.039 --> 00:22:05.400
I don't get winded climbing stairs.

00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:06.680
My back doesn't hurt anymore.

00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:07.640
And

00:22:08.039 --> 00:22:09.680
I'm getting younger every day.

00:22:12.039 --> 00:22:12.759
Quick, tell us!

00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:14.319
Where can we buy one?

00:22:14.599 --> 00:22:15.079
Yeah,

00:22:15.359 --> 00:22:16.200
where do we get it?

00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:17.400
This is a national treasure.

00:22:18.119 --> 00:22:18.640
It's called

00:22:18.799 --> 00:22:20.240
"A baiji dolphin in stone,"

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:22.400
"a panda in a mine."

00:22:22.759 --> 00:22:24.319
How could it be sold publicly?

00:22:24.359 --> 00:22:25.720
Where did you buy it?

00:22:26.039 --> 00:22:27.119
Where did you get it?

00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:28.400
But

00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:30.440
if you really want one,

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:32.440
I can get it for you internally.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:33.400
Okay.

00:22:33.559 --> 00:22:34.319
But

00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:36.480
it's not cheap.

00:22:37.559 --> 00:22:38.559
Case solved.

00:22:38.839 --> 00:22:40.400
Scammer.

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:41.680
Same style, right?

00:22:41.759 --> 00:22:42.559
Let me see it.

00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:44.279
What's this called?

00:22:45.559 --> 00:22:47.319
Internal documents call it

00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:50.119
Baikela Crystal.

00:22:51.559 --> 00:22:53.200
How does he know about Baikela Stone?

00:23:02.799 --> 00:23:03.880
Baikela Crystal.

00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:05.160
It really does have

00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:07.440
rejuvenating powers.

00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:12.880
This

00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:14.039
should be

00:23:14.319 --> 00:23:16.200
a specialty of Titan Star.

00:23:16.759 --> 00:23:18.839
I bought one during interstellar travel.

00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:20.160
Hurry, tell us.

00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:21.200
Where did you find it?

00:23:22.559 --> 00:23:23.480
Me,

00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:24.720
I was at

00:23:26.039 --> 00:23:26.960
You're one of us too.

00:23:28.319 --> 00:23:29.160
You're an alien too?

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:31.799
What are you talking about?

00:23:32.119 --> 00:23:33.640
The first time I saw your photo,

00:23:33.799 --> 00:23:35.880
I knew you were in disguise.

00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:38.160
You want to blend in with humans, right?

00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:40.039
You...

00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:43.119
What are you doing?

00:23:44.839 --> 00:23:46.119
With this crystal,

00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:47.240
we have a chance

00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:48.359
to return to our home planet.

00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:50.160
Escape this stupid Earth.

00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:51.039
That's great!

00:23:51.079 --> 00:23:51.960
What does he know?

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:52.920
Thinks I'm easy to bully because I'm old.

00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:53.200
No.

00:23:53.319 --> 00:23:54.039
Yeah.

00:23:54.079 --> 00:23:54.640
Exactly.

00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:55.920
He's got dementia.

00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:56.640
She's making it up.

00:23:58.640 --> 00:23:59.480
Where are you going?

00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:01.200
Wait for me!

00:24:01.799 --> 00:24:03.599
Let's not stoop to the Earthlings' level.

00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:05.039
Where are you going?

00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:24.160
So?

00:24:24.559 --> 00:24:25.400
Any luck?

00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:27.079
I almost had something.

00:24:27.279 --> 00:24:28.319
But he slipped away.

00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:30.640
What did you get?

00:24:31.559 --> 00:24:32.720
That Baikela thing...

00:24:34.599 --> 00:24:36.240
Earthlings don't know anything.

00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:37.839
Dad.

00:24:38.839 --> 00:24:39.240
Dad.

00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:42.680
About Lili's dream—

00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:46.200
It's settled.

00:24:46.519 --> 00:24:48.480
I guarantee everything will be fine tomorrow.

00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:50.079
Back to being inseparable.

00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:51.599
That's impressive.

00:24:52.599 --> 00:24:53.000
No.

00:24:53.079 --> 00:24:53.839
What did you do?

00:24:53.839 --> 00:24:54.559
Me?

00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:56.359
You can trust me to handle things.

00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:05.559
I almost had it.

00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:06.559
But it got away.

00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:08.599
What's going on?

00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:21.680
Please forgive my outburst earlier.

00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:27.000
Lili,

00:25:28.799 --> 00:25:30.240
Even if you had three heads and six arms,

00:25:31.319 --> 00:25:33.279
even if you came from the edge of the universe,

00:25:34.119 --> 00:25:35.359
I would still love you forever.

00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:40.759
You'll always be my bride.

00:26:10.359 --> 00:26:10.920
Meng Hang.

00:26:11.319 --> 00:26:12.160
Th-this...

00:26:12.799 --> 00:26:13.640
What is this thing?

00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:14.279
This...

00:26:17.799 --> 00:26:18.599
Th-this...

00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:20.680
I told you,

00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:22.720
we shouldn't have listened to my dad.

00:26:47.559 --> 00:26:49.519
Information found online

00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:52.759
I mean well

00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:55.839
Helping you

00:26:55.839 --> 00:26:57.160
To chase away your nightmares?

00:26:58.599 --> 00:27:00.640
You should look up how to ward off yourself first

00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:04.039
You are my nightmare

00:27:13.119 --> 00:27:13.920
Forget it

00:27:14.279 --> 00:27:15.920
I shouldn't have longed for a wedding

00:27:18.799 --> 00:27:19.519
Forget it

00:27:20.079 --> 00:27:21.599
Don't upset Lili again

00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:23.680
Forget it

00:27:24.279 --> 00:27:27.559
No way this family can fund a trip to Antarctica

00:27:31.519 --> 00:27:32.599
No one's eating this bun

00:27:32.599 --> 00:27:33.559
I'll eat it then

00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:35.160
My back's not good

00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:36.039
I need to nourish myself

00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:39.480
Why do you look like a tardigrade

00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:41.319
No brains

00:27:41.519 --> 00:27:42.400
No worries

00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:47.640
Who is it

00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:50.440
Who's knocking so passionately

00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:51.880
Who is it

00:27:52.559 --> 00:27:54.039
Knocking so hard, no restraint

00:27:56.960 --> 00:27:57.440
Who are you looking for

00:27:57.519 --> 00:27:58.039
Move aside

00:27:58.880 --> 00:27:59.200
No

00:27:59.240 --> 00:27:59.799
You guys

00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:01.319
What are you doing

00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:01.799
No

00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:02.839
Who are you looking for

00:28:03.039 --> 00:28:03.839
I'm looking for you

00:28:04.279 --> 00:28:05.680
You ruined our business, didn't you

00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:09.319
What business

00:28:09.799 --> 00:28:10.839
Still pretending, huh

00:28:11.119 --> 00:28:12.039
Lao Liang already told us

00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:13.200
If it weren't for you

00:28:13.359 --> 00:28:14.519
Those old men and women

00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:15.599
Would've taken the bait long ago

00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:17.640
Lao Liang

00:28:18.119 --> 00:28:19.079
I'm looking for him too

00:28:19.119 --> 00:28:19.599
Where is he

00:28:19.839 --> 00:28:20.880
That Liang guy messed up

00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:22.200
This is our boss

00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:25.079
Then

00:28:25.279 --> 00:28:26.599
Pass a message to Lao Liang

00:28:27.039 --> 00:28:28.640
If there's Baikela Crystal

00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:29.759
Send it to me

00:28:30.039 --> 00:28:31.240
If not

00:28:31.599 --> 00:28:32.680
See yourself out

00:28:33.279 --> 00:28:35.200
You refuse a toast, so you get forced

00:28:35.319 --> 00:28:36.680
Don't blame me for being rough then

00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:38.480
So you want to fight

00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:39.279
Me

00:28:42.079 --> 00:28:43.000
What the hell

00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:44.319
Take anything valuable for me

00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:45.640
Smash what you can't take

00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:49.480
Son, call the police

00:28:49.759 --> 00:28:50.319
Yeah, yeah

00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:51.440
I'm telling you, I'm calling the police

00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:52.079
You dare

00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:53.039
Hit

00:28:54.359 --> 00:28:54.920
Th-this

00:28:57.720 --> 00:28:58.519
I'll show you

00:29:21.559 --> 00:29:22.240
Don't come closer

00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:23.079
Back off

00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:23.839
Back off

00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:24.839
You back off, I—

00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:40.720
You're not mad at me anymore, right

00:29:41.519 --> 00:29:42.039
Still mad

00:29:45.799 --> 00:29:46.359
Go away

00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:55.559
If you have a problem

00:29:56.039 --> 00:29:56.759
Come at me

00:29:58.160 --> 00:29:59.279
At least you have a conscience

00:29:59.599 --> 00:30:00.079
Let me tell you

00:30:00.079 --> 00:30:01.440
I know snake fist, mantis fist

00:30:10.039 --> 00:30:11.640
Bragging about that?

00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:12.799
Let me do it

00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:13.680
Freeze

00:30:19.559 --> 00:30:20.240
Got it

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:36.519
Open

00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:44.039
I'm telling you, I'm tough

00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:45.720
I know tiger-crane style

00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:46.160
Me

00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:47.720
Appearing Dragon in the Field

00:30:47.799 --> 00:30:48.960
Flying Dragon in the Sky

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:50.480
Overbearing Dragon Has Regrets

00:30:55.039 --> 00:30:56.240
Why are you still mad at me

00:30:56.279 --> 00:30:56.880
Wedding

00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:58.160
Didn't I say we wouldn't do it

00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:00.400
That's not what I meant

00:31:10.559 --> 00:31:11.359
Let you show off

00:31:11.759 --> 00:31:12.440
How is it

00:31:13.359 --> 00:31:14.400
It's fine, it's fine

00:31:14.519 --> 00:31:14.960
Let's go

00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:15.640
Are you okay

00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:19.359
I want to do it

00:32:20.519 --> 00:32:21.279
Do what

00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:22.960
Wedding

00:32:24.759 --> 00:32:26.000
I want to have a wedding

00:32:26.119 --> 00:32:26.759
Wear a wedding dress

00:32:26.799 --> 00:32:27.640
Walk the aisle

00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:28.680
Really

00:32:30.559 --> 00:32:30.960
Okay

00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:32.480
Then let's

00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:33.160
Do it

00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:50.839
Finish what you were saying

00:32:53.319 --> 00:32:54.319
Wedding

00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:01.440
Back then,

00:33:02.319 --> 00:33:04.079
I started with a "Wild Goose Lands on the Sand,"

00:33:04.599 --> 00:33:06.319
then switched to a "Rabbit Kicks the Eagle,"

00:33:06.839 --> 00:33:08.559
and spun into a "Great Roc Spreads its Wings."

00:33:10.039 --> 00:33:11.240
I took Lao Liang's crew

00:33:11.519 --> 00:33:12.680
down completely.

00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:14.680
You weren't there,

00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:16.160
so it's a shame you missed it.

00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:18.720
From the start,

00:33:18.839 --> 00:33:20.319
I knew Lao Liang was a scumbag.

00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:21.400
Right? Right?

00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:23.440
Luckily, Cai Xiaoying exposed him.

00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:24.000
Didn't she?

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:24.440
That's right.

00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:27.640
I set up Cai Xiaoying.

00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:28.960
I arranged it.

00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:30.559
I'm the Great Sage Equal to Heaven,

00:33:30.559 --> 00:33:31.799
and she's my Brother Sha.

00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:33.200
Big Brother is right.

00:33:33.319 --> 00:33:34.000
Big Brother said it.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.279
Yes, yes, that's right.

00:33:35.279 --> 00:33:36.359
I arranged it.

00:33:38.799 --> 00:33:39.640
My son is getting married in a few days.

00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:40.279
It's a big celebration.

00:33:40.359 --> 00:33:41.039
Everyone, come!

00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:42.039
Alright, alright.

00:33:42.039 --> 00:33:42.960
Don't come empty-handed.

00:33:44.359 --> 00:33:44.920
Everyone should go.

00:33:46.319 --> 00:33:48.640
I've returned to my peaceful campus life.

00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:50.839
Uncle Gao, Uncle Meng.

00:33:51.279 --> 00:33:52.279
Hello, teacher. Hello, teacher.

00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:55.240
Thanks to our hero,

00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:56.839
everyone's property

00:33:56.960 --> 00:33:58.839
was kept safe from any loss.

00:33:58.920 --> 00:33:59.400
That's right.

00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:00.839
No, it's what I should do.

00:34:00.839 --> 00:34:01.599
It's my duty.

00:34:01.799 --> 00:34:02.400
Yes, yes.

00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:03.759
We have to thank Uncle Meng.

00:34:04.119 --> 00:34:05.279
We must thank Uncle Meng.

00:34:06.079 --> 00:34:06.839
Thank him

00:34:06.839 --> 00:34:07.839
for bringing Auntie Cai

00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:09.159
to be with us.

00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:10.679
Yes.

00:34:23.719 --> 00:34:25.199
Alright, alright.

00:34:28.519 --> 00:34:29.119
Well,

00:34:29.199 --> 00:34:30.519
it was Auntie Cai

00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:32.679
who saw through the scammer's tricks.

00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:35.280
She's a hero of our University for the Elderly.

00:34:35.559 --> 00:34:36.079
So,

00:34:36.239 --> 00:34:38.239
we specially hired Auntie Cai

00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:39.400
to be our

00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:41.320
Safety and Life Counselor.

00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:43.400
Let's give her another round of applause.

00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:44.400
Alright.

00:34:46.679 --> 00:34:48.480
She became my teacher.

00:34:52.039 --> 00:34:52.960
From my observation,

00:34:53.039 --> 00:34:54.920
many people on Earth don't want a wedding.

00:34:55.079 --> 00:34:55.880
They think it's too much trouble.

00:34:56.480 --> 00:34:57.599
Often,

00:34:57.679 --> 00:34:58.239
a wedding

00:34:58.239 --> 00:35:00.440
is just a show for friends and family.

00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:02.000
In some places,

00:35:02.039 --> 00:35:03.599
there are even bad customs.

00:35:04.159 --> 00:35:05.039
I totally support

00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:06.079
not having one

00:35:06.159 --> 00:35:06.880
if you don't want to.

00:35:07.079 --> 00:35:08.320
There's nothing to be embarrassed about.

00:35:08.719 --> 00:35:09.519
But if you're like me

00:35:09.639 --> 00:35:10.320
and want a wedding,

00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:11.599
just admit it openly.

00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:13.320
There's nothing shameful about it.

00:35:14.159 --> 00:35:14.840
Having a wedding

00:35:15.079 --> 00:35:16.199
is one of my

00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:17.800
important experiences on Earth.

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:19.199
If it doesn't go well this time,

00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:20.480
I'll improve next time.

00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:21.840
By the way,

00:35:22.119 --> 00:35:22.599
this

00:35:22.599 --> 00:35:24.000
is my wedding invitation QR code.

00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:26.639
Earthlings can give wedding cash gifts, no limit.
