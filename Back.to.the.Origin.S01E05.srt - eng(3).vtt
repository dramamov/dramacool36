00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:44.240
I think

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.800
you should just let her try.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.000
Or she won't

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:48.160
be satisfied.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.880
If it doesn't work out,

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:50.880
you two can always come back.

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:52.800
What's the point of trying

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:53.680
if you already know how it'll turn out?

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.759
How do you know it'll be exactly

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.520
what you think if you don't let her try?

00:01:59.000 --> 00:01:59.680
At least

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:00.960
there's still hope, right?

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:02.880
Hope just makes it worse.

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.040
Look at you.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:05.760
If you hadn't won

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:06.560
that award for your film,

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:07.640
would you have been so stubborn

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:08.320
and ended up like this?

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:13.280
Sorry.

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.400
At least I won an award.

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:17.520
Have you?

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.079
That's not the point.

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:20.600
Right?

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:24.880
Actually, I've thought about it.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.240
If I could do it all over again,

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.720
knowing it would end this way,

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.120
would I still have given it my all

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.920
to filmmaking?

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.920
Even if I had to borrow money to do it?

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.000
I'm telling you, I would.

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.760
Because at that time,

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.160
at that age, with that kind of spirit,

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.320
I felt like I could control

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:45.400
everything.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.079
I really loved

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:49.520
that ambitious side of myself.

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.320
Every morning I woke up

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:52.960
with a clear goal.

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:54.280
Not like now.

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:59.680
Not that now is bad.

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:00.240
You know.

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:01.080
Being here with you,

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.160
fishing leisurely.

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:03.320
It's nice too.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.520
I think it's too much trouble.

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.160
What isn't?

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:11.960
Us fishing here right now,

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.520
isn't that a form of trouble?

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:14.480
You think

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:15.720
we're fishing just to eat fish?

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:16.520
Well?

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.400
Can't we just buy some fish?

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.400
Or do we like fish that much?

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.840
No, right?

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.760
Where's the fun in life without a little struggle?

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.760
Don't you have

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.640
any wishes you want to fulfill,

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.720
or things you really want to do?

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.600
When I was a kid, I really wanted

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:47.600
to get away from my dad.

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:48.920
So I came to Canada.

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:53.520
And now I'm going back.

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.120
No wonder you think that way.

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.520
Okay, let's talk about now.

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:08.560
What about now?

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:09.680
Is there anything

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:10.800
you really want to do right now?

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:14.080
Right now,

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:16.320
I just hope to

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:17.839
hold my family close.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.320
Okay.

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:22.079
Your family.

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.320
Then you have to

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.120
think carefully

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:28.720
how exactly

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.120
can you hold

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.960
your family close?

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:44.200
Hey,

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:45.000
why do I

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.480
never get a bite?

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:48.640
What's going on?

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:49.120
Why?

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:51.520
My bait's

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.080
all gone.

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.320
You need to focus.

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:57.200
Just now, the fish

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:58.280
nibbled your line several times.

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:59.240
You missed it.

00:04:59.440 --> 00:04:59.920
Really?

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.600
Too busy lecturing me about life.

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.040
You know what?

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.440
Right now,

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:07.960
you might not want to hear this,

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:09.800
but you'll understand someday.

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.000
These new neighborhoods are so remote.

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:18.400
It's nowhere near as convenient as our place.

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:19.440
Where are we?

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:20.720
Gotta transfer again?

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.000
- Which bus now?
- Forget it.

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:25.400
Let's not bother with another bus.

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:26.240
Let's get a taxi.

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:28.280
Go ahead.

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:31.480
Need to register?

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.280
- Real-name verification?
- Such a pain.

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:40.159
Honey, one's coming.

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:41.040
Taxi.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:43.680
Get in the car first.

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:44.280
Okay?

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:45.680
This one's probably free.

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:55.640
[Welcome aboard Lucheng Taxi.]

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:03.040
Hello, Mr. Guo.

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:04.200
[Hello, Cheng Man.]

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:04.840
[I asked the store staff]

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:06.080
[to deliver]

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:06.920
[that sake.]

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:08.040
[It should arrive soon.]

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:09.320
[Wish you and your friends]

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:10.120
[enjoy your drink.]

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:12.480
Thanks so much.

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:13.920
It's just that your sake

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:15.000
is really too good.

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:16.800
I was going to ask a friend to order it,

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:18.160
but ended up troubling you.

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:19.880
[No trouble at all.]

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:21.120
[No need to ask a friend.]

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:23.280
[Just tell me if you like it.]

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:24.640
[Next time you want some,]

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:25.520
[just come to my store.]

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:26.560
Okay, sure.

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:27.840
That's very kind of you.

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:28.720
Mr. Guo,

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:29.600
when you have time

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:31.520
I'll treat you to a meal to thank you.

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:32.640
[Sure.]

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:34.680
Thanks. Bye.

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:35.880
[Okay, bye.]

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:36.320
Who was that?

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:39.760
A regular. Sending us some drinks.

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:41.880
You are

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:43.280
so popular.

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:46.159
Report!

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.440
Change complete. Awaiting instructions.

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.200
No shorts when guests come.

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:52.240
Change it.

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:53.960
Yes.

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:55.920
Got it.

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:04.360
Then what should I wear?

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:05.840
Something more formal.

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:07.520
How do I

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:09.000
even define "formal"?

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:10.760
At least wear something with a collar.

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:12.320
At least?

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:15.440
With a collar?

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:25.600
You two.

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:26.680
What are you up to?

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:29.160
We're visiting a friend.

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:30.600
The unit number?

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:34.760
Building 23, Unit 3.

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:37.120
The resident's name?

00:07:37.159 --> 00:07:37.640
Li Daoqi.

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:39.400
Li Daoqi.

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:40.200
Are you sure?

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:42.560
Not right.

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:43.280
Cheng Man.

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:46.159
Right.

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:47.840
Excuse me, how do we get to Building 23?

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:49.840
That way.

00:07:50.159 --> 00:07:51.240
Go straight to the end.

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:52.320
Then turn left.

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:53.360
You'll see a small path.

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:54.840
Follow that path all the way.

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:55.960
Then turn right.

00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:57.320
You'll see a small lake.

00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:58.960
Follow the lake to the end.

00:07:58.960 --> 00:07:59.680
Then turn left.

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:00.760
It's a bit far.

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:04.880
Thank you.

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:05.440
It's nothing.

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:09.880
Straight.

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:10.720
To the end, turn right.

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:11.160
To the end...

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:12.360
To the end, turn right...

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:13.040
Turn left...

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:13.880
There's a lake.

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:15.080
-He said to turn right.
-No, left.

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:16.200
No, first go to the end

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:17.800
and turn right first.

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:20.440
Turn left!

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:23.760
The man just said turn left!

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:24.720
Where are you going?

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:26.320
Didn't we just turn left?

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:26.720
We didn't...

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:28.360
We've been going straight.

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:31.560
Just call him.

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:32.960
How can we find it like this?

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:34.200
Everything looks the same.

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:35.919
It's like a maze.

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:36.760
Call him, just call him.

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:42.720
Yeah,

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:44.120
I turned left.

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:44.760
I...

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:46.360
All buildings look identical here.

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:48.480
Can't you just come out

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:49.320
and get us?

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:51.200
Hello?

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:53.560
What did he say?

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:55.280
He said we should find it ourselves.

00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:56.960
Ourselves?

00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:58.600
If we could find it, why would we be calling?

00:08:58.720 --> 00:08:59.560
Let me check the navigation app.

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:02.320
Everything looks exactly the same.

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:03.680
Nobody around to ask.

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:04.920
Kids there, go ask them.

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:06.080
Kids? Are you serious?

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:06.560
I'm checking the navigation app.

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:07.240
Just go ask!

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:07.960
I won't.

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:08.360
Okay.

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:11.160
Rock, paper, scissors... Loser goes.

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:15.400
Excuse me,

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:16.320
could you tell us

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:17.640
how to get to Building 23?

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:18.920
-There. -Over there.

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:20.920
What?

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:21.720
Look.

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:23.840
Where do you think it could be?

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:27.280
The GPS says it's over there.

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:28.560
Thank you.

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:29.360
Let's go.

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:31.240
Why?

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:33.040
We definitely haven't been this way.

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:33.880
We're here.

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:35.160
The dot on the map isn't moving.

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:35.960
Go forward.

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:37.120
No, it's not moving.

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:38.440
-It's not...
-It moved.

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:40.520
No, it didn't.

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:41.400
Why is it jumping all over the place?

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:41.760
Look,

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:42.320
it doesn't even show

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:43.360
where we are now.

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:46.160
You're just

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:47.400
going in circles, Fu Yudong.

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:48.520
Someone's over there, I'll ask.

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:49.160
Wait here.

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:52.720
Excuse me.

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:55.280
What building is this?

00:09:58.560 --> 00:09:59.800
26

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:00.920
Just go straight, right?

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:01.720
Thanks.

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:06.720
Fu Yudong! Over here!

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:10.480
Hurry!

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:14.600
Over here!

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:16.600
Coming, coming!

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:17.320
Excuse me,

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:18.840
is this Building 23, Unit 3?

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:19.520
Yes.

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:21.200
Hello, we're...

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:23.600
Wasn't it sake?

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:24.560
Why is it Icewine?

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:25.560
Did they mix it up?

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:28.520
Never mind, you probably don't know.

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:29.520
Here, thanks.

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:30.720
Are they here?

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:32.000
No, it's the wine delivery guy.

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:33.040
I think

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:34.080
I'm near your place.

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:35.000
Can you come pick me up?

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:35.480
Honey!

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:37.440
Coming.

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:41.040
Look who's here!

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:45.120
Come out, say hello to my wife.

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:48.360
Okay.

00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:49.280
Make yourself at home.

00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:50.440
Have some appetizers first.

00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:52.160
The main course will be ready soon.

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:53.400
Have some water.

00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:53.880
No, thanks.

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:54.920
I already got this drink.

00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:57.160
Help yourselves.

00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:58.200
Sorry about that.

00:10:58.520 --> 00:10:59.440
My friend said

00:10:59.480 --> 00:10:59.960
he'd send us

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:01.200
some wine,

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:02.240
so I assumed...

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:03.160
Just a misunderstanding.

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:03.920
My mistake, my apologies.

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:05.160
No worries.

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:05.880
It's fine, really.

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:07.400
Don't trouble yourself.

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:08.760
We haven't seen each other

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:09.520
in so long.

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:10.960
Just sitting here and chatting

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:11.840
is what's important.

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:12.920
Exactly, catching up.

00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:15.720
Okay, thank you.

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:16.440
Thanks.

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:17.360
Where's your son?

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:18.160
He's in class.

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:20.360
Class?

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:21.960
I thought he

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:23.520
wasn't old enough for school yet.

00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:24.960
That's the deal with kids in China, right?

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:26.640
People say if a kid

00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:28.160
learns 1,500 English words,

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:28.960
it's enough to get by in Canada,

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:30.080
but not even close in China.

00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:31.240
Why?

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:31.800
The competition is insane!

00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:33.720
Actually, back home,

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:34.880
it's not all like that.

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:35.960
We didn't sign him up

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:37.400
for academic classes.

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:39.880
Just painting and pottery.

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:41.160
We just want him to have

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:43.120
some artistic exposure from a young age.

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:45.720
No language classes either.

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:46.240
No rush.

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:47.360
No rush at all.

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:48.040
I agree.

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:49.160
Kids should

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:50.640
just be happy.

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:52.000
Don't put too much pressure on them.

00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:54.040
Zhang Ran said

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:54.880
she grew up

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:55.880
learning English

00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:57.080
and was really good at it.

00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:58.160
But when she moved to Canada,

00:11:58.160 --> 00:11:59.440
she realized everyone spoke English,

00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:00.280
so it was basically useless.

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:06.440
I love

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:07.400
your yard.

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:08.800
Did you hire someone to take care of it?

00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:09.680
My wife

00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:10.920
is in charge of the gardening.

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:12.800
I take care of it myself.

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:14.000
I've been

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:15.120
staying home lately

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:16.000
with nothing better to do,

00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:17.320
so I started fiddling with the garden.

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:18.040
And this is how it turned out.

00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:19.360
To be honest,

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:21.800
I've lived in Canada for years,

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:23.000
seen countless yards,

00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:25.000
especially Chinese families'.

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:26.360
Yours is

00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:27.640
one of a kind.

00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:29.160
Really?

00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:29.720
Yeah.

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:31.040
What about you, Zhang Ran?

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:31.920
Do you like gardening?

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:33.160
We could exchange tips.

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:34.840
I'm not into flowers and plants much.

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:35.800
I might be a bit allergic.

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:37.040
I'll get you a mask.

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:38.080
No, wait!

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:39.000
You're allergic?

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:39.480
Allergic to what?

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:40.200
Allergic to you.

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:41.720
That's love.

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:43.200
Then you're screwed.

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:44.400
She's allergic to me.

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:48.400
So now you just

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:50.720
take care of the yard all day?

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:52.240
Did she quit her job?

00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:52.880
Retired.

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:54.440
Gloriously retired.

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:54.800
Not really.

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:55.920
After Nian was born,

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:57.400
I stepped back from the front lines.

00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:00.360
Anyway, the team is on track now.

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:01.960
I just attend meetings occasionally

00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:03.400
and meet important clients.

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:04.840
Semi-retired, you could say.

00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:05.960
What did

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:06.960
you do, Man?

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:08.000
Retired so young.

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:09.160
Insurance broker.

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:11.360
Selling insurance?

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:12.720
That's a tough job.

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:13.240
I have a few friends

00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:14.200
in insurance on WeChat,

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:15.520
they're under so much pressure.

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:18.680
Being an insurance salesperson and

00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:19.760
an insurance are two very different things.

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:20.120
Oh really?

00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:21.720
An insurance broker

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:24.320
is a professional broker for insurance.

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:25.840
Oh,

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:26.840
I get it now.

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:28.000
Your wife is brilliant.

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:29.560
Don't listen to his nonsense.

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:31.720
That's not a wrong way to put it.

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:33.120
But insurance brokers

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:34.440
only handles large corporate clients.

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:35.520
Still a difference.

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:37.240
I just got into the industry early,

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:37.960
rode the wave

00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:39.520
during the boom over a decade ago.

00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:40.680
When I met my wife,

00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:41.600
she was one of those "gold-collar" elites

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:43.160
at a top investment bank

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:46.080
in Hong Kong's Central.

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:47.800
And she graduated from

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:50.720
Royal University of London.

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:51.840
A top student, absolutely.

00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:53.280
Your Royal College of Toronto is,

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:53.720
you know,

00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:55.240
not quite up to hers.

00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:56.240
Now I just

00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:57.440
look up to my wife.

00:13:57.640 --> 00:13:57.960
Total admiration.

00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:01.960
Man, you've been working

00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:02.800
for quite a long time.

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:03.640
Let me see.

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:05.280
10 years in insurance,

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:06.720
plus a few years retired.

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:08.560
How old are you?

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:09.520
She was born in the Year of the Horse.

00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:11.640
1978, 45 years old.

00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:12.760
Six years older than me.

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:15.720
Oh my.

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:17.720
How can you reveal

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:18.640
a woman's age like that?

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:20.120
I never would've guessed.

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:21.640
You've maintained yourself so well.

00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:23.200
Seriously, amazing.

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:24.160
I told you,

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:25.240
they're a May-December romance.

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:27.840
Aren't you two here to catch up?

00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:29.000
Why keep talking about me?

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:30.280
Talk about yourselves.

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:31.320
We have nothing to talk about.

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:32.800
Oh right.

00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:35.360
So, how

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:36.240
did the proposal

00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:37.120
actually go down?

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:37.560
You sent me

00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:38.520
lots of messages back then.

00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:39.400
Plan A, Plan B,

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:40.040
Plan C,

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:41.440
Plan D, E, F, G, H...

00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:44.560
I ended up using Plan I.

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:47.160
Let me tell you,

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:48.360
when it comes to romance,

00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:50.200
I personally think

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:51.800
I've peaked.

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:55.720
I learned a magic trick.

00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:57.280
Gonna show you today.

00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:59.440
This trick is called "Switcheroo".

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:01.640
Piece of cake.

00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:02.880
Just like that.

00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:04.880
Now, one of these three cups

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:07.160
has something

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:08.640
under it.

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:09.960
Guess the right cup,

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:11.400
I pick up

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:13.360
the tab.

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:16.960
What if I guess wrong?

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:18.280
We go Dutch.

00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:22.280
Go on, guess.

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:30.040
Choose carefully.

00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:31.840
Going Dutch on this meal is gonna be expensive.

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:38.600
No clue.

00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:43.320
This one?

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:44.360
Flip over and see.

00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:47.880
Three, two, one.

00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:53.880
What is this?

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:55.560
Well...

00:15:57.960 --> 00:15:59.320
I bought a ring.

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:01.680
I was thinking, if you don't have

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:03.400
anything else going on,

00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:04.960
maybe you could marry me?

00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:08.760
Please?

00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:13.520
How did you know

00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:14.840
I'd pick this one?

00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:22.040
Wait, two more?

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:24.000
Gotta cover all bases.

00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:25.760
I bought three.

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:27.760
Pick whichever you like.

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:29.160
Styles are a bit different.

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:31.560
I'll return the other two

00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:32.880
tomorrow morning.

00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:35.520
You can return it?

00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:37.200
No?

00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:39.600
Probably not.

00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:47.120
Li Daoqi.

00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:53.920
That's a problem.

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:00.960
Li Daoqi.

00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:02.880
You're the master of romance. Seriously.

00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:03.640
If Fu Yudong had

00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:04.599
had one-tenth of your skill,

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:05.359
I'd be satisfied.

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:07.440
Mostly it's just your good looks.

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:09.839
Right, didn't you say

00:17:09.839 --> 00:17:10.680
you had some good news?

00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:11.520
Tell us about it.

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:15.440
My sake finally arrived.

00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:16.359
Let me go get it.

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:19.520
Don't wait for me.

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:20.359
Tell them now.

00:17:20.359 --> 00:17:20.800
Nope,

00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:21.880
I'll wait for you to come back.

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:22.680
Just tell them.

00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:24.400
I won't, I'll wait for you.

00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:26.680
Thanks, thanks.

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:30.360
Okay, go on.

00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:33.920
Honey,

00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:35.800
could you bring a few cups?

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:37.720
They are right next to you.

00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:40.160
Today,

00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:43.080
we have a double celebration.

00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:44.160
First, Yudong and his wife

00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:48.480
have returned home in glory.

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:50.800
From now on, we two can live

00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:51.480
like a pot to its lid,

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:53.520
always together!

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:54.040
Stop messing with me.

00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:55.320
Returned in glory? Come on.

00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:56.160
Tell us the second one.

00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:57.360
The second one.

00:17:57.520 --> 00:17:58.480
That's the big one.

00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:01.920
I'm getting a promotion.

00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:04.360
Senior Manager.

00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:05.960
Are you sure?

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:06.640
Any day now.

00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:07.720
I told you,

00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:09.600
Li Daoqi, I knew you could do it!

00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:11.080
Gold shines wherever it goes.

00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:11.800
Sake's here.

00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:12.520
Drink this.

00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:13.560
Come on.

00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:15.240
Here, drink this.

00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:16.000
Drink this.

00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:17.680
That's great news! Congratulations!

00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:18.400
Here.

00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:19.680
You're a winner in life, Li Daoqi!

00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:20.160
Okay, thanks.

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:20.600
You have it all now.

00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:21.320
Here.

00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:21.640
Here.

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:28.160
Hello, I'm Zhang Ran, graduated from

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:30.560
the English Department of Lucheng University.

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:32.400
I worked at Lucheng TV Station

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:33.920
as a bilingual host.

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:36.480
Looking forward to working with you.

00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:41.720
Okay.

00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:55.400
Just put it here then.

00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:56.120
You can go now.

00:18:57.960 --> 00:18:59.080
Hello, can I help you?

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:00.240
Hello, I'm Zhang Ran.

00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:01.240
I have an appointment with Qian Dan

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:03.200
at 2 PM today.

00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:04.640
Let me contact Ms. Qian for you.

00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:05.120
Okay.

00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:05.760
Please sign in first.

00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:06.520
Okay, no problem.

00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:10.760
Hello, Ms. Qian.

00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:12.520
There's a lady at reception who says

00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:13.760
she has a 2 PM meeting with you.

00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:15.520
Her name is...

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:16.840
Zhang Ran.

00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:17.920
Zhang Ran.

00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:20.120
Okay, okay, okay.

00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:21.520
I'll leave it here.

00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:22.760
Please wait here for a moment.

00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:23.600
Okay, thank you.

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:32.040
How many times

00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:32.760
do I have to say it?

00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:34.000
Once something is decided in a meeting,

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.120
it's final. Got it?

00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:39.120
Zhang Ran.

00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:40.400
Qian... Qian Dan.

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:41.280
Yes, sorry

00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:41.960
to keep you waiting.

00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:42.960
It's fine, I just arrived.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:43.680
Nice to meet you.

00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:44.720
You just got back yesterday, right?

00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:45.520
Yes, just got back.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.080
Did you get over the jet lag?

00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:47.520
It's okay.

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:48.600
I don't really get jet lag.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:49.920
So efficient.

00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:50.960
Perfect for our company.

00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:51.840
Come on, Zhang Ran.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.240
Let me give you a quick tour of

00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:54.360
Tide Media.

00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:56.040
The smallest live stream room.

00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:57.520
We call this room

00:19:57.520 --> 00:19:58.520
the "Nursery".

00:19:59.520 --> 00:19:59.960
See?

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.280
The streamers here have fewer than

00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:02.360
100,000 followers.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:03.960
It's basically a training ground

00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:05.600
for beginners.

00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:06.520
Got it.

00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:07.000
Yeah.

00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:08.560
It's by appointment only.

00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:09.680
Each room has a time limit

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:10.960
for live streaming.

00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:13.120
You can book them online.

00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:14.440
Come, check this out.

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:15.560
These themed studios

00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:16.920
are for streamers with over

00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:18.240
300,000 followers.

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:19.760
They're also by appointment, but

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:21.480
we can change the background

00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:22.960
to fit the streamer's needs at any time.

00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:24.040
Generally speaking,

00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:24.960
the streamers here

00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:26.400
have relatively stable

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:27.280
fan bases.

00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:28.520
Got it.

00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:29.240
Got it.

00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:31.480
Their streams go for

00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:32.760
at least four to six hours.

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:34.320
Sometimes a single stream

00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:35.440
can exceed ten hours.

00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:37.200
Alright, family, come to my stream

00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:38.520
and shop for clothes with confidence!

00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:40.400
See?

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:41.480
This is our most efficient

00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:43.320
sportswear streamer.

00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:44.680
That took some real effort.

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:45.880
The meeting room I booked

00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:46.520
is already due,

00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:48.560
but why's someone still in there?

00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:49.600
Just a moment.

00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:51.960
Our company is always strict

00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:53.280
about time efficiency.

00:20:57.480 --> 00:20:57.920
Ms. Qian.

00:20:58.480 --> 00:20:59.080
Your time is up.

00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:00.120
Why haven't you finished yet?

00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:01.760
Almost done. Just need another twenty minutes.

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:02.760
Having a retrospective meeting here.

00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:03.080
Almost...

00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:03.840
You have five minutes.

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:06.960
Gotta wait five minutes.

00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:08.160
I'll show you around a bit more.

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:09.000
Sure, sure.

00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:11.320
Careful.

00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:12.520
We're still live,

00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:13.360
we can't cut the stream.

00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:15.440
This is a new livestream format

00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:16.720
we developed,

00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:17.760
set right here in our company.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.520
Over here is our meeting room.

00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:20.760
They're picking products for the

00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:22.440
special stream the day after tomorrow.

00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:23.320
And this is

00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:25.040
a mid-size streaming zone.

00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:26.520
We call it the Hive.

00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:27.040
The Hive.

00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:28.320
Right. The idea is

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:29.520
our streamers are like worker bees,

00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:31.280
working hard to make money

00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:32.440
for the company.

00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:33.080
Got it.

00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:34.360
To stream in this area,

00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:35.480
you need over

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:36.320
100 thousand followers.

00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:37.400
They're in

00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:38.360
a growth phase,

00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:39.920
so we give them more fine-tuned support

00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:40.960
to break through the plateau

00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:41.520
and boost followers,

00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:42.000
engagement and conversion.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:42.400
Dan.

00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:45.360
Perfect timing, let me introduce you.

00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:46.680
This is our boss,

00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:47.400
Lin Chang.

00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:48.120
Lin Chang.

00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:49.360
Hi, I'm Zhang Ran.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.800
You look so young! Are you from the 90s?

00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:53.360
New face.

00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:54.240
Total newbie.

00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:56.120
She's here to meet us today.

00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:57.240
Yeah, I used to

00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:58.400
host shows

00:21:58.400 --> 00:21:59.520
at Lucheng City TV,

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:00.440
but that was many years ago.

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:02.680
Nice to meet you.

00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:03.520
Nice to meet you too.

00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:05.200
I'm Lin Chang.

00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:05.840
Lin Chang.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:06.920
Welcome

00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:08.000
to the family.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:08.800
Thank you.

00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:09.680
I'll be in your care.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:11.880
If you need anything, come to my office.

00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:13.120
Okay, no problem.

00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:16.360
Our boss is really young.

00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:16.800
Yeah.

00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:17.520
Ms. Qian,

00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:20.480
there's a

00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:21.960
talent-streamer audition this afternoon.

00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:23.360
Rou's friend.

00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:24.560
Please look out for her.

00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:25.480
Sure, no problem.

00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:28.680
He looks so young.

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:29.320
He is.

00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:31.040
He's also really fun

00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:32.360
and super talented.

00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:33.000
Come on,

00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:34.560
I'll keep showing you

00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:35.320
around the Hive.

00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:35.720
Okay.

00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:36.760
New followers

00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:38.120
and live viewers are shown

00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:39.960
in real time on the LED screens.

00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:42.560
Li Qian, your numbers are dropping.

00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:43.360
Guys, hang on a sec,

00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:43.960
we'll be right...

00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:44.560
See?

00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:46.240
If their followers drop below

00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:47.360
100 thousand,

00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:48.280
they have to move back

00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:49.800
to the training studio we saw earlier

00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:51.120
and start over.

00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:51.560
Right.

00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:52.480
Look at this one.

00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:54.160
His recent numbers

00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:55.200
are bad.

00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:56.560
The content's stale.

00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:57.680
It's hard to keep fans.

00:22:57.880 --> 00:22:58.600
At this rate,

00:22:58.600 --> 00:22:59.440
he'll be out soon.

00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:01.200
Only two likes?

00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:02.320
I kind of want to give him one.

00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:05.160
Turn around.

00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:06.920
This is Tide Media's

00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:07.680
master control screen.

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:09.520
All the streamers' live data

00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:10.760
scrolls here.

00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:12.240
We can see

00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:13.120
everyone's performance anytime;

00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:14.400
- it's all open and transparent.
- Got it.

00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:17.560
This is our

00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:19.680
top female streamer's lounge

00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:21.880
and studio.

00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:24.000
Tide Media's No.1 girl, Lin Anran.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:25.200
You must know her.

00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:26.120
Yeah.

00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:27.000
She's gorgeous.

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:28.960
Sorry,

00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:29.720
I need to take this.

00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:30.760
No worries.

00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:31.400
Hello?

00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:33.760
[The contract cannot be changed,]

00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:34.320
[okay?]

00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:36.120
[Payment terms are not up for discussion.]

00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:37.160
[Stop wasting my time.]

00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:40.960
You know Lin Anran, don't you?

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:41.800
Of course.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:43.040
So don't stress.

00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:44.000
Even she

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:45.120
started in the training studio

00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:46.480
and worked her way up here.

00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:47.360
Understood.

00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:49.960
- Hi.
- Dan.

00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:51.280
You look stunning.

00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:52.440
Stunning? I'm a total mess

00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:53.360
and swamped!

00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:54.120
Going live soon?

00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:54.400
Yeah, yeah,

00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:55.080
starting in ten minutes.

00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:55.560
Go, go.

00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:56.040
Okay.

00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:57.080
Anran.

00:23:57.560 --> 00:23:58.360
Jesus.

00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:00.280
You look amazing today.

00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:01.360
I'll send you a little gift,

00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:03.560
hope you go full firepower tonight.

00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:04.680
Full firepower.

00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:05.560
All right, go crush it.

00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:06.240
I'll head out.

00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:06.920
Okay.

00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:08.560
Dan.

00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:09.680
No need. Knowing Anran

00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:10.160
has you covered.

00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:10.880
Come on,

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:11.760
Zhang Ran,

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:12.920
this is our

00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:14.280
famous "Number Two".

00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:16.240
"Number Two" is the one with glasses?

00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:16.800
No,

00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:18.920
the one with glasses

00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:20.040
is his assistant.

00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:22.600
"Number Two" is about to have lunch.

00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:24.320
He's the No.1

00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:25.400
pet-content creator

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:26.080
right now.

00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:28.760
Come, over here.

00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:30.560
This is our makeup room,

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:31.680
shared for

00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:32.480
everyone.

00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:32.920
Got it.

00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:34.400
Any streamer can book a slot

00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:35.200
to do their makeup here.

00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:35.840
Okay.

00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:36.920
Ms. Dan.

00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:37.840
Hi.

00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:38.760
Nice, very creative.

00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:39.080
Yeah.

00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:48.880
Impressive.

00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:57.840
Dan, I actually did some homework

00:24:57.840 --> 00:24:59.120
before I came

00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:00.360
and prepped

00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:02.080
a bunch of materials for finance shows.

00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:03.200
But after

00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:04.280
this tour,

00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:05.720
I feel like that might

00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:06.680
not be very useful here.

00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:09.640
It's fine. You're serious about this,

00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:10.640
that's good.

00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:13.840
I really did watch your show

00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:14.640
back then,

00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:17.040
but now,

00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:18.800
the channels for entertainment

00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:20.480
have totally shifted.

00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:21.080
Right.

00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:22.680
So I need you

00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:24.000
to be mentally prepared

00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:25.760
to start from scratch.

00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:30.040
My old show

00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:32.520
actually had pretty decent influence.

00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:33.440
And after that,

00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:34.480
I did a current-affairs lifestyle show

00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:35.600
for two years.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:37.200
In a place like Lucheng City,

00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:38.560
I wouldn't say

00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:40.160
everyone knows my name,

00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:41.040
but when people see me,

00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:41.840
they usually think,

00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:43.000
"She looks familiar."

00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:44.200
But that was then.

00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:47.760
Let's talk about now, okay?

00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:52.560
Right now, it's all about data.

00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:53.280
Everything

00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:54.720
lives or dies by numbers.

00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:56.160
Do you know

00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:57.520
the Qiandu search index

00:25:57.520 --> 00:25:58.560
for the No.1

00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:00.480
female streamer in the business,

00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:01.440
Lady Wan?

00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:03.320
No.

00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:05.680
25,089.

00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:08.240
Do you know our company's No.1 girl,

00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:09.680
Lin Anran's index?

00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:12.720
13,521.

00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:15.320
Do you know what Zhang Ran is at?

00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:17.240
How much?

00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:18.680
In 2011,

00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:20.280
when you were still hosting

00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:21.720
at the TV station,

00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:24.760
your peak

00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:26.360
was 3,089.

00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:28.160
Your average that year

00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:29.760
was 380.6.

00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:30.680
Today,

00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:32.480
right this second,

00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:34.280
it's 30.

00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:35.880
Which means

00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:38.040
that on today's internet,

00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:40.800
"Zhang Ran" equals a nobody.

00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:46.720
Got it.

00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:49.960
I know

00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:51.400
these numbers

00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:52.400
are hard to swallow.

00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:54.160
I brought you back

00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:55.560
from overseas.

00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:56.600
I'm definitely not here

00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:57.840
to tear you down.

00:26:58.440 --> 00:26:59.200
But I have to

00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:00.360
be honest with you.

00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:02.600
Zhang Ran, I really had to

00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:03.840
push for you when we

00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:05.080
discussed your contract.

00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:06.880
I got a lot of pushback,

00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:08.360
but I believe in you.

00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:09.880
Like you said,

00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:11.200
you've got a foundation.

00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:12.480
I believe

00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:15.320
you can become a top-tier streamer.

00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:21.800
Dan, how about this:

00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:23.720
young people

00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:25.200
might not be

00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:26.720
that into finance shows.

00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:29.280
What if we do

00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:30.600
overseas-lifestyle content instead?

00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:32.640
I mean, I do have that advantage,

00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:33.640
since I've just

00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:34.800
come back from abroad.

00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:36.280
I could share

00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:37.800
what I've eaten,

00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:38.880
what I've seen,

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:40.440
fun places,

00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:41.480
cool stuff,

00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:42.080
be an

00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:43.920
overseas-lifestyle creator.

00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:45.560
Do you think that's possible?

00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:47.000
Do you know

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:48.120
why we actually want to sign you?

00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:49.880
You said

00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:52.080
you watched my show,

00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:53.520
so you're one of my fans.

00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:56.320
I thought maybe

00:27:56.480 --> 00:27:57.760
it was my skills,

00:27:57.760 --> 00:27:58.240
or

00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:00.600
my on-camera experience.

00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:03.360
And there

00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:05.840
was that meme sticker of me...

00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:08.360
Finally, you've hit it.

00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:11.000
We're signing you

00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:13.640
because of that meme,

00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:16.440
and only because of that meme.

00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:28.200
At Tide Media,

00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:29.160
we incubate lots of new streamers

00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:30.440
every year.

00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:31.840
We've built a very

00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:33.840
systematic training program.

00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:35.240
As long as

00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:36.200
you stick with us,

00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:37.960
you'll level up at light speed.

00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:39.760
This is

00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:41.240
our rookie training area.

00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:43.200
We put everyone on the same floor

00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:44.480
as the CEO

00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:45.920
and our top streamers

00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:46.400
to create

00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:47.600
a stronger

00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:48.720
atmosphere,

00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:50.720
so everyone pushes themselves.

00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:55.680
We treat all streamers

00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:56.800
the same.

00:28:57.600 --> 00:28:59.000
It's all data-driven,

00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:01.680
fair, open, transparent.

00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:04.280
Every bit of effort and progress

00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:06.320
is rewarded immediately.

00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:08.280
Lin Anran is just

00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:09.480
the first star streamer

00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:10.720
we built.

00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:13.120
There will be a second,

00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:14.160
a third.

00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:15.600
What we can promise is:

00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:17.200
once you join Tide Media,

00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:19.800
the path up is wide open.

00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:28.240
Look over here,

00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:30.280
this is shade 152.

00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:31.720
The girl in white

00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:32.840
is wearing

00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:33.280
152 today.

00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:34.200
It makes her skin

00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:35.640
look super, super fair.

00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:36.200
Blow everyone

00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:37.400
a little kiss.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:41.080
I want it, I want it.

00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:41.800
You want it?

00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:43.080
Okay, ready,

00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:44.440
three, two, one.

00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:04.560
With all the stress people face,

00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:06.400
the "Desperate Shopper" persona

00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:06.840
is

00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:07.800
really appealing.

00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:10.080
Think about it when you get home.

00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:11.480
I'll send you

00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:12.600
an e-copy of the contract.

00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:13.640
Go through it,

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:15.640
and give me an answer within a week.

00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:16.480
Okay, no problem.

00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:17.760
Thank you for today.

00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:18.200
Sure.

00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:18.840
I'll head back then.

00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:19.560
Okay, bye.

00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:19.960
Bye.

00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:23.640
Ms. Liao, right?

00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:24.840
I'm Qian Dan.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:26.120
Sorry

00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:28.080
to keep you waiting. Come in,

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:30.000
I've been dying to meet you.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:31.520
Did you sleep okay last night?

00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:33.440
Let me show you,

00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:34.920
this is one of our

00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:36.200
small streaming studios.

00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:29.520
You don't need to walk me out.

00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:30.160
Get back.

00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:30.840
Why would I go back?

00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:32.080
My car's right at the gate.

00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:33.400
I'll call a driver to take you home.

00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:34.920
That's too much trouble.

00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:36.200
I already booked a car online.

00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:36.920
What did you book a car for?

00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:37.240
Don't.

00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:38.600
My car's right there,

00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:39.960
I'll just get a driver.

00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:41.520
Look,

00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:44.960
it'll be here any second.

00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:48.000
Okay, no wonder you've got a PhD,

00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:48.640
you've already

00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:50.840
figured out the ride-hailing apps.

00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:53.000
Seamless transition.

00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:53.920
Impressed, huh?

00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:54.840
Not bad.

00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:55.960
I'm off.

00:31:56.440 --> 00:31:57.360
Take it slow.

00:31:58.600 --> 00:31:59.680
Let's go play soccer sometime.

00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:01.120
Write me a letter.

00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:03.680
You got it.

00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:20.800
Can I change the destination?

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:22.120
Not going to the sugar factory anymore?

00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:24.080
Can we go to Lucheng University?

00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:25.320
You booked the car on your phone,

00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:26.000
you have to change the address

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:27.000
on your phone.

00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:31.320
How? I'm not great with this.

00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:33.800
Check in your order details.

00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:56.960
Found it?

00:32:58.760 --> 00:32:59.800
You can start heading that way.

00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:00.600
I should have it changed

00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:01.920
in a second.

00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:03.400
All right.

00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:48.080
You're back.

00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:00.920
Here, have some water.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:02.000
Thanks, thank you.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:02.880
Don't be so polite.

00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:08.600
When did you get back?

00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:10.360
You didn't say a word in advance.

00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:12.400
I could've asked Daoqi to pick you up.

00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:13.679
We just got back yesterday.

00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:14.920
Well,

00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:16.080
I went over

00:34:16.239 --> 00:34:17.520
to Daoqi's place at noon.

00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:19.560
They're doing pretty well.

00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:20.480
Yeah, yeah,

00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:22.120
Daoqi's doing great.

00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:24.280
He often brings the kids over to see us.

00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:35.760
Well,

00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:37.280
I'll go make dinner.

00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:39.040
You're eating here tonight.

00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:40.639
I'll even go buy a fish.

00:34:40.679 --> 00:34:41.040
No need.

00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:41.840
Just wait for me, wait here.

00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:42.760
Really, you don't have to.

00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:44.400
Just stay and eat, it'll be quick.

00:34:44.639 --> 00:34:46.080
Have a good chat with your dad.

00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:47.080
I'm really not staying for dinner.

00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:48.280
Just wait, I'll be quick.

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:49.600
Slow down!

00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:55.120
She's always like that,

00:34:55.719 --> 00:34:57.560
rushing around.

00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:05.560
Yudong,

00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:07.520
look, she even poured you water.

00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:09.080
Come on, have some.

00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:15.720
How long

00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:17.200
are you planning to stay this time?

00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:22.560
Not sure yet.

00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:23.760
Depends.

00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:28.080
Are you

00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:30.520
still working that security job?

00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:32.680
Yeah, still at it.

00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:33.960
Three days on, one day off.

00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:35.280
Easy work.

00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:37.080
Otherwise

00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:39.360
I'd be bored at home.

00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:41.240
I'm too old to just sit around all day.

00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:51.920
This time you came back,

00:35:52.120 --> 00:35:53.520
your wife, Zhang Ran...

00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:55.080
She's fine,

00:35:56.080 --> 00:35:56.640
she's doing good.

00:35:57.840 --> 00:35:58.760
I should get going.

00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:00.720
I... Are you...

00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:02.360
are you keeping well?

00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:05.000
Yeah, I'm fine.

00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:06.560
Okay, I'm heading out then.

00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:10.920
Yudong, don't go.

00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:12.200
She went out to buy groceries.

00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:13.480
Thank her for me.

00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:16.720
Just stay and eat, you...

00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:36.520
What are you looking at?

00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:39.280
Who's Zhu Danwei?

00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:40.320
Who?

00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:41.600
Zhu Danwei.

00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:44.440
"There's no perfect ending.

00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:47.840
I'll always miss you."

00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:49.880
Does this person still miss you now?

00:36:49.880 --> 00:36:51.040
Guess so.

00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:51.720
And he wrote

00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:52.800
his first impression

00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:54.440
was that you were hard to approach.

00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:56.000
Hahaha.

00:36:56.320 --> 00:36:56.960
Yeah?

00:36:57.400 --> 00:36:57.920
Close that.

00:36:57.920 --> 00:36:58.960
Let me tell you about

00:36:58.960 --> 00:36:59.800
the company I went to today.

00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:01.440
It blew my mind.

00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:02.400
The moment I walked in,

00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:03.880
Qian Dan took me around.

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:04.880
The place is huge,

00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:06.480
like a maze.

00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:07.560
Every streamer

00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:08.880
is in a little cubicle.

00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:10.240
All glass, transparent,

00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:11.240
everyone outside can see in.

00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:12.200
She took me

00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:13.440
from one entrance

00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:15.000
and we just kept walking and walking.

00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:17.000
I swear, it was eye-opening,

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:17.840
really,

00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:19.720
you can't even picture it.

00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:21.040
Super grand.

00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:22.720
She said

00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:23.960
those glass rooms

00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:24.920
are called the Hive,

00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:26.000
and those streamers

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:27.720
really are like worker bees,

00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:29.040
buzzing around,

00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:30.040
busy non-stop.

00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:31.240
I was stunned.

00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:32.480
Every type of person you can think of.

00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:33.520
There was this girl

00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:35.640
with horror-movie makeup,

00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:37.240
her whole face covered in fake blood,

00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:39.320
singing and dancing in there.

00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:40.280
Scared me half to death.

00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:41.280
The others

00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:42.720
just walked in circles

00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:43.720
as they streamed.

00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:45.080
Let me show you this photo.

00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:46.920
It really shocked me.

00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:47.960
I thought something had happened to her.

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:48.680
See?

00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:51.040
She's lying there, asleep.

00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:51.960
There's a bucket next to her.

00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:53.360
When she's thirsty,

00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:54.160
she pulls a tube

00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:55.000
over to herself

00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:55.920
and just sips

00:37:56.120 --> 00:37:57.040
like this.

00:37:57.040 --> 00:37:58.240
I watched her

00:37:58.520 --> 00:37:59.200
pull the blanket up

00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:00.280
and instantly start snoring.

00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:01.960
How exhausted must she be?

00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:04.040
Look,

00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:08.440
look at this one.

00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:10.120
What are you scrolling there?

00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:12.520
I recorded it on purpose

00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:13.320
to show you later.

00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:15.320
I won't deny it,

00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:16.840
there really was a golden age

00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:18.320
for overseas returnees.

00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:19.360
But

00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:20.400
in this era,

00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:22.160
whether you studied abroad or not

00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:23.280
doesn't matter that much anymore.

00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:25.320
What employers need has changed.

00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:27.400
If you put my resume

00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:28.640
into today's market,

00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:30.640
I honestly wouldn't be competitive.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:32.840
Don't sell yourself short.

00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:34.360
You, not competitive?

00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:36.880
No, I'm just being honest.

00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:38.200
I really did ride the wave

00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:39.040
of my times,

00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:40.040
and I have to admit that.

00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:41.840
But Yudong,

00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:44.160
just so you know,

00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:46.160
things are different now.

00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:49.640
I'm mentally prepared.

00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:52.760
My wife says

00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:54.040
she's not willing to just give up.

00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:55.280
She wants

00:38:56.080 --> 00:38:57.320
to come back and take a shot.

00:38:57.480 --> 00:38:58.400
If that's how she feels,

00:38:58.520 --> 00:39:00.040
then I have to be there for her.

00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:00.960
But there is a cost

00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:02.520
to all this trial and error.

00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:05.440
Our situation's different.

00:39:05.480 --> 00:39:06.800
I was doing renovation work

00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:08.000
in Canada, remember?

00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:08.920
Worst case,

00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:10.320
I just go back and do what I did before.

00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:14.120
Don't be a downer.

00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:15.280
They just got back.

00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:16.160
I'm not,

00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:17.600
I'm just telling the truth.

00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:18.960
You have no idea,

00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:20.360
blue-collar work overseas

00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:21.280
makes really good money,

00:39:21.320 --> 00:39:23.320
sometimes more than white-collar,

00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:24.880
and the schedule's more flexible.

00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:27.440
But you still had to come back.

00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:28.640
He has a PhD

00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:30.960
from a top university.

00:39:32.360 --> 00:39:34.200
Doing renovation work abroad

00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:35.560
is such a waste of his talent.

00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:39.040
So pitiful.

00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:42.560
Fu Yudong.

00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:44.040
Fu Yudong?

00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:46.520
It's really tough.

00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:50.400
You used to be

00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:53.560
a well-known TV host,

00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:56.040
and now you have to do things like this.

00:39:56.320 --> 00:39:57.200
So what?

00:39:57.200 --> 00:39:59.120
I can start over.

00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:02.080
I know I can pull it off.

00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:04.360
It's just too hard on you.

00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:06.080
It's fine, really.

00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:09.080
Can we maybe not do this?

00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:10.160
I won't push myself that hard.

00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:13.160
Are you sleepy?

00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:16.600
Maybe my jet lag still isn't fixed.

00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:17.200
I'm going to sleep.

00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:17.920
Don't worry,

00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:19.200
this is really what I'm good at.

00:40:19.400 --> 00:40:20.680
The gap between me and them

00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:21.720
is like earth and sky.

00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:27.120
This is their master control wall.

00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:30.280
If I do well one day,

00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:31.560
I'll get my picture up here.

00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:34.120
Look at this dog,

00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:36.760
worth more than we are.

00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:40.280
Even has a little bow tie.

00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:41.520
Look at him eat.

00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:43.680
His name's "Number Two".

00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:45.480
This one's Lin Anran,

00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:46.560
I secretly snapped it

00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:47.560
outside her door.

00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:52.040
I totally get

00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:53.560
where both of you are coming from.

00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:57.120
Li Daoqi

00:40:58.080 --> 00:40:59.360
is the best brother

00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:00.560
I've ever had.

00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:05.360
Everything he says is for my own good.

00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:07.440
That's why he pushes me.

00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:10.440
And you're my favorite sister-in-law.

00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:12.360
You'd never

00:41:13.520 --> 00:41:15.240
mean any harm.

00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:20.840
Before I left Canada,

00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:23.160
I put everything

00:41:23.160 --> 00:41:24.160
into storage.

00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:27.160
I left really early that morning,

00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:29.560
before sunrise.

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:32.280
I drove past a stretch of woods,

00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:33.480
and just as I came out of

00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:34.600
the last bend,

00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:36.480
the sun popped up

00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:37.240
right in front of me.

00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:38.720
That's when it hit me:

00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:41.400
the next time I saw the sunrise,

00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:43.080
I'd already be back in China.

00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:45.360
And that's when I realized:

00:41:46.720 --> 00:41:47.640
I hadn't even thought about

00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:50.840
what I was going to do.

00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:55.960
Zhang Ran wants to chase her dream.

00:41:56.760 --> 00:41:58.120
I have to have her back.

00:42:02.040 --> 00:42:03.040
But with what?

00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:04.080
How can I support her?

00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:06.000
It's just...

00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:08.560
I haven't been back in so many years.

00:42:09.160 --> 00:42:10.040
Now that I'm here,

00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:10.880
everything

00:42:12.040 --> 00:42:13.440
feels too fast. I feel like...

00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:15.320
I can't keep up with anything.

00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:18.200
I feel a bit lost.

00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:20.720
With me here, don't be lost.

00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:25.120
And if you are, don't be scared.

00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:26.600
Really.

00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:28.480
Don't be afraid of being lost.

00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:31.000
A toast to being lost.

00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:34.640
To a bright future.

00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:37.160
To being lost.

00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:38.800
To being lost.

00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:41.520
To being lost.

00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:47.160
You feel sad?

00:42:48.720 --> 00:42:49.200
I'm okay.

00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:50.280
Don't feel sad.
