You and Ms. Bai
trained us exactly like this

00:03:12.541 --> 00:03:13.821
when we first joined the firm.

00:03:14.661 --> 00:03:16.101
We were in such chaos back then.

00:03:16.821 --> 00:03:18.661

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.821

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.101

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:04.300

00:08:11.221 --> 00:08:12.101

00:08:18.152 --> 00:08:18.824

I did better.

00:10:20.061 --> 00:10:21.181
Because I discussed

00:10:21.181 --> 00:10:22.581
with everyone and found out

00:10:31.421 --> 00:10:32.301

more legal expertise.

00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:35.301
But I checked Jun An's official website

00:10:35.301 --> 00:10:37.740
and realized that
the logistics company in this case

00:10:37.821 --> 00:10:40.540

is our main clientele.

In this case,

00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:45.421
there is

00:10:45.421 --> 00:10:47.061
no employment relationship between

00:10:47.061 --> 00:10:48.061

00:10:48.181 --> 00:10:49.301
(Scoring point: Company and Li)
The "Courier Service Agreement"

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:52.260
(No employment relationship)
they signed isn't an employment contract.

00:10:52.701 --> 00:10:53.461
Moreover, Li lacks

00:10:53.461 --> 00:10:55.780
the necessary dependency
and subordination

00:10:56.061 --> 00:10:58.301

00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:02.061
Regarding the subordination,

00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:04.461
I researched previous court rulings

00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:06.701
(and compiled a case research report)

00:11:06.821 --> 00:11:08.181
(as an appendix)

00:11:08.181 --> 00:11:09.380
(Similar case research report)
(to my legal opinion.)

00:11:09.581 --> 00:11:11.301
(Scoring point: Collated cases)
It can support the viewpoints

00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:12.101
(Supports legal arguments)
in my legal opinion.

00:11:14.181 --> 00:11:14.780
Well done.

00:11:16.101 --> 00:11:18.780
Given Jiang Chen's
common law background,

00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:21.500
he emphasizes case law research.

00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:23.581
This is highly commendable.

00:11:23.701 --> 00:11:24.900
Because he's the only one

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:25.821
who addressed

00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:27.380
this aspect.

00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:28.660
Thank you.

00:11:29.544 --> 00:11:30.140
Ren Jiatong.

00:11:30.568 --> 00:11:31.221
Your thoughts?

00:11:32.061 --> 00:11:33.061
While Jiang Chen's use

00:11:33.061 --> 00:11:35.221
of case research and precedents

00:11:35.221 --> 00:11:36.581
is admirable.

00:11:37.061 --> 00:11:38.140
I maintain that

00:11:38.301 --> 00:11:39.260
legal opinions must

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.260
provide substantive assistance

00:11:41.301 --> 00:11:42.461
to our clients.

00:11:42.981 --> 00:11:45.061
My client is courier Li.

00:11:45.061 --> 00:11:46.020
My proposal

00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:46.860
not only offers

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:48.941
detailed legal analysis

00:11:49.061 --> 00:11:50.900
(but also outlines)

00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:52.421
(Scoring point: Client guidance)
(potential litigation strategies)

00:11:52.701 --> 00:11:55.301
(Litigation strategies)
if he is to file a lawsuit,

00:11:55.341 --> 00:11:56.181
including

00:11:56.181 --> 00:11:58.421
jurisdiction selection,
party identification,

00:11:58.701 --> 00:11:59.660
and enumerated

00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:02.020
(Scoring point: Enumerated)
actionable claims.

00:12:02.701 --> 00:12:03.380
(actionable claims)
I think

00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:05.101
if my proposal is chosen,

00:12:05.101 --> 00:12:06.380
my supervisors

00:12:06.701 --> 00:12:08.780
won't need to revise my work extensively

00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:10.500
and can quickly respond to clients.

00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:14.181
Brilliant.

00:12:15.221 --> 00:12:17.101
While others focused solely

00:12:17.101 --> 00:12:18.020
on case analysis,

00:12:18.421 --> 00:12:20.461
displaying a student mentality.

00:12:21.461 --> 00:12:22.500
Ren Jiatong stood out.

00:12:23.341 --> 00:12:24.101
Ms. Bai remarked,

00:12:24.941 --> 00:12:26.821
"You're thinking like a working lawyer

00:12:26.821 --> 00:12:28.461
solving real problems."

00:12:28.941 --> 00:12:30.581
It's high praise from her.

00:12:32.421 --> 00:12:35.380
I've also done
some case research last night.

00:12:35.701 --> 00:12:37.341
I realized that our case

00:12:37.341 --> 00:12:39.701
qualifies for evidence preservation.

00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:42.341
But Mr. Zhou specified that

00:12:42.421 --> 00:12:44.701
this opinion is client-facing,

00:12:44.701 --> 00:12:46.581
and such technical details seem

00:12:46.581 --> 00:12:48.221
quite excessive for the client.

00:12:48.821 --> 00:12:50.461
Here are my additional comments

00:12:50.461 --> 00:12:52.461
for the lead lawyer.

00:12:58.660 --> 00:12:59.341
Good job.

00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:01.341
You're right.

00:13:01.821 --> 00:13:03.140
We don't need to present

00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:04.500
these documents to the clients.

00:13:06.301 --> 00:13:07.620
But if you had submitted

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:08.660
these documents

00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:09.780
to your supervisor

00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:11.461
as reference material last night,

00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:13.221
then you'd have

00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:14.660
taken first place.

00:13:19.688 --> 00:13:20.341
Mr. Song,

00:13:20.701 --> 00:13:21.981
I object to the ranking.

00:13:23.421 --> 00:13:24.981
I've carefully reviewed

00:13:25.181 --> 00:13:26.461
the other three proposals.

00:13:27.221 --> 00:13:29.821
I have doubts about one
that scores higher than mine.

00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:33.736
Yan Fei.

00:13:35.821 --> 00:13:36.380
Any thoughts?

00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:40.380
I think Guo Xiaoyu's approach

00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:41.941
with the Q&A format works well.

00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:43.780
She addresses clients' specific concerns

00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:46.581
while maintaining clarity.

00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:48.301
If I were the client,

00:13:48.301 --> 00:13:49.301
I'd prefer that style

00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:50.821
over dry legal recitations.

00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:53.821
Not legal recitations.

00:13:54.221 --> 00:13:55.860
I was applying legal terminology,

00:13:56.540 --> 00:13:58.020
which embodies the essence of law.

00:13:58.380 --> 00:13:59.461
Our expressions

00:13:59.461 --> 00:14:00.540
shouldn't mirror those of

00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:02.301
untrained laypeople, right?

00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:04.101
Lord Denning once said,

00:14:04.421 --> 00:14:06.140
"To succeed in the profession

00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:06.821
of the law,

00:14:06.821 --> 00:14:07.660
you must seek to

00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:08.900
cultivate command of language."

00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:10.540
The study of law

00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:12.421
is the study of Forensic Linguistics.

00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:15.740
I acknowledge that

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:19.341
I need to improve my legal writing,

00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:21.660
but making complex concepts accessible

00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:22.620
for clients

00:14:22.701 --> 00:14:24.860
doesn't indicate greenness.

00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:26.821
Think about those popular

00:14:26.821 --> 00:14:28.020
Bar Exam prep videos.

00:14:28.301 --> 00:14:30.020
Instructors gain popularity

00:14:30.301 --> 00:14:31.981
by explaining intricate legal issues

00:14:31.981 --> 00:14:33.380
with clarity

00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:34.380
and humor.

00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:35.341
In this case,

00:14:35.341 --> 00:14:36.981
most of us chose client Mr. Li,

00:14:36.981 --> 00:14:38.341
the deliveryman

00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:40.701
without a legal background.

00:14:42.581 --> 00:14:43.341
Guo Xiaoyu?

00:14:44.701 --> 00:14:46.181
You make legal education videos?

00:14:48.221 --> 00:14:49.461
Your channel's called

00:14:49.461 --> 00:14:50.821
"Xiaoyu's Legal Tips".

00:14:52.461 --> 00:14:52.981
Guo Xiaoyu.

00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:54.660
That's you?

00:14:57.101 --> 00:14:58.221
I remember your video

00:14:58.221 --> 00:14:59.581
about recent graduates

00:14:59.581 --> 00:15:01.461
signing employment contracts.

00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:03.140
It was an animation.

00:15:03.341 --> 00:15:03.981
That was fun.

00:15:04.461 --> 00:15:05.540
Really, Mr. Song?

00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:08.380
I just threw that together.

00:15:08.461 --> 00:15:10.581
I can't believe you saw
and remembered it.

00:15:11.301 --> 00:15:12.061
I remember because

00:15:12.061 --> 00:15:13.660
you misrepresented a legal relationship.

00:15:17.221 --> 00:15:18.900
That's all regarding the assessment.

00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:21.461
I expect more dedication

00:15:21.461 --> 00:15:22.660
in the next test.

00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:25.221

and pretended not to notice.

00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:20.421
So that was Ms. Bai.

00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:23.100
Her WeChat name is in English.
That's why.

00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:24.740
Let me edit it.

00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:28.421
Congrats.

00:19:28.861 --> 00:19:30.100
The first to work with Ms. Bai.

00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:31.400
Thank you.

00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:35.661
You're truly exceptional.

00:19:36.141 --> 00:19:37.060
You reminded me.

00:19:37.381 --> 00:19:39.300
I need to adjust my jogging schedule

00:19:39.701 --> 00:19:41.141
or I'll miss group messages.

00:19:43.141 --> 00:19:43.901
Thanks again.

causes trouble at Warm Nest)

Law School of Jingbei University.
Jun An Law Firm.

00:19:56.100 --> 00:19:57.381
Jun An Law Firm.

00:19:57.500 --> 00:19:58.740
Jun An Law Firm.

00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:01.224
(Found the video
from your colleague's account.)

00:20:01.661 --> 00:20:03.621
(Had someone edit it
and spread it on Weibo.)

00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:05.500
(One competitor down.)

00:20:32.911 --> 00:20:34.120
(Ms. Xu, Xiaoxiao, Mom, Missed calls)

00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:35.912
(Notifications: 56 new messages)

(Voice calls: 19 new messages)

00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:50.580
Get our money back.

00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:55.020
I recorded the video.

00:20:55.580 --> 00:20:57.820
I posted it online and forgot about it.

00:20:58.181 --> 00:21:00.141
How did the content farm notice it?

00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:02.621
Nobody ever checks my account.

00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:05.421
I swear I didn't see it coming.

00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:09.381
You did nothing wrong
by posting the video.

00:21:10.181 --> 00:21:11.461
Don't beat yourself up.

00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:15.020
I never meant to harm Ren Jiatong.

00:21:15.861 --> 00:21:17.221
Maybe Ren Jiatong sent it

00:21:17.221 --> 00:21:19.060
to those marketing accounts herself.

00:21:19.621 --> 00:21:21.820
Maybe she wants to
capitalize on it to gain fame.

00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:25.260
She's not that type of person.

00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:27.701
Besides, I'm the one who recorded this.

00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:29.020
It's my fault.

00:21:30.461 --> 00:21:31.060
Where is she?

00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:33.701
She used to come so early.

00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:36.060
She wouldn't quit over this, would she?

00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:37.300
No way.

00:21:37.981 --> 00:21:38.664
No way.

00:21:38.941 --> 00:21:39.941
She came this morning.

00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:42.060
Her things have been moved.

00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:44.020
You even noticed that?

00:21:44.421 --> 00:21:45.500
She's always the first in.

00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:46.461
I'm the last to leave.

00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:47.421
So I can tell.

00:21:59.421 --> 00:22:00.020
Mr. Zhou.

00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:02.941
Will I be eliminated
because of Warm Nest?

00:22:03.421 --> 00:22:04.020
To be honest,

00:22:04.060 --> 00:22:05.580
this is quite significant.

00:22:05.701 --> 00:22:06.340
I've learned

00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:08.461
that Warm Nest's previous legal counsel

00:22:08.461 --> 00:22:09.861
was an obscure small firm.

00:22:09.981 --> 00:22:11.540
Warm Nest has been talking with us,

00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:12.941
thinking about employing us.

00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:15.060
Your timing couldn't be worse.

00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:17.060
I don't know the final decision,

00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:18.141
but Mr. Zhuang

00:22:18.141 --> 00:22:19.340
and the partners

00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:21.020
will talk about it and decide.

00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:24.221
Is there something I can do?

00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:26.100
I can't just wait to be eliminated.

00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:30.621
Prove your worth.

00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:32.540
Excel in your current tasks.

00:22:37.701 --> 00:22:38.340
Thank you.

00:22:55.861 --> 00:22:56.661
Ren Jiatong.

00:22:58.740 --> 00:22:59.661
I'm so sorry.

00:23:00.260 --> 00:23:01.861
I-I didn't do it on purpose.

00:23:02.181 --> 00:23:04.020
I film random videos for fun

00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:05.300
and upload them to my account.

00:23:05.580 --> 00:23:07.381
I wasn't plotting anything that night.

00:23:07.701 --> 00:23:09.020
I just found you amazing,

00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:10.740
so I filmed it and posted it.

00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:11.941
Hardly anyone

00:23:11.941 --> 00:23:13.461
ever watches my videos.

00:23:13.461 --> 00:23:14.701
Most of my followers are

00:23:14.861 --> 00:23:16.221
my classmates and friends.

00:23:16.221 --> 00:23:18.340
The most likes I ever get
are around a few dozen.

00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:19.461
I don't know

00:23:19.461 --> 00:23:20.981
what happened this time.

00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:21.820
It's fine.

00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:26.181
I feel awful.

00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:28.020
It's fine.

00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:30.020
You didn't edit it maliciously.

00:23:30.221 --> 00:23:32.260
You just recorded objectively, right?

00:23:32.540 --> 00:23:34.141
You even used a beauty filter on me.

00:23:35.461 --> 00:23:36.381
Can you let me through?

00:24:02.421 --> 00:24:03.100
(What do I do?)

00:24:03.181 --> 00:24:04.661
(Huang Yue)
(I didn't know it'd blow up.)

00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:05.661
(She's in trouble.)

00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:07.461
(Should I tell my superior the truth?)

00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:09.141
(My older guy)
(Didn't you tell me)

00:24:09.141 --> 00:24:10.381
(to secure your position?)

00:24:10.728 --> 00:24:11.260
(Yue.)

00:24:11.701 --> 00:24:12.740
(There are ways to win.)

00:24:12.981 --> 00:24:13.621
(Grow up.)

00:24:13.704 --> 00:24:14.221
Everyone,

00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:16.340
Mr. Song has sent

00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:17.780
the requirements and materials

00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:19.381
for the second task

00:24:19.381 --> 00:24:20.260
to your emails.

00:24:20.621 --> 00:24:21.621
Please check them.

00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:22.981
Let's have a meeting

00:24:23.381 --> 00:24:24.621
at 10:00 AM.

00:24:24.941 --> 00:24:26.221
Mr. Song will provide

00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:27.300
further explanations.

00:24:33.820 --> 00:24:35.300
This assessment requires

00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:37.500
all of you to collaboratively translate

00:24:37.540 --> 00:24:39.540
legal documents
for a cross-border M&A case.

00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:41.421
Let me brief you on this.

00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:43.701
Our client is a Chinese company

00:24:43.941 --> 00:24:45.901
acquiring a foreign enterprise,

00:24:46.181 --> 00:24:46.780
named Kern.

00:24:48.861 --> 00:24:50.260
The "Kern Company"?

00:24:50.701 --> 00:24:52.500
The promising unicorn company

00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:54.260
in semiconductor design

00:24:54.340 --> 00:24:55.780
with numerous patented inventions.

00:24:57.020 --> 00:24:57.608
That's right.

00:24:57.981 --> 00:24:59.260
After the acquisition,

00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:00.861
Kern will integrate

00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:03.421
with our client in semiconductor R&D.

00:25:03.752 --> 00:25:04.300
They have

00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:05.981
signed multiple agreements.

00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:06.941
Recently,

00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:10.020
they finalized some details
through negotiations.

00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:11.340
Kern Company

00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:13.141
has retained the renowned US firm

00:25:13.141 --> 00:25:13.740
James Law Firm

00:25:13.941 --> 00:25:14.780
to work with us.

00:25:15.181 --> 00:25:17.181
They need joint legal reviews

00:25:17.381 --> 00:25:18.740
from both perspectives.

00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:22.740
Hand them out.

00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:24.740
Pass them on.

00:25:24.981 --> 00:25:25.621
James Law Firm

00:25:25.621 --> 00:25:27.340
drafted the latest
supplementary agreement

00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:30.100
with supporting annexes
in English based on

00:25:30.181 --> 00:25:31.100
the negotiations.

00:25:31.901 --> 00:25:32.780
Your task is to

00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:34.661
translate these documents
and submit them

00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:36.421
within 24 hours.

00:25:36.621 --> 00:25:37.701
It's time-sensitive.

00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:39.820
So I recommend clear task division.

00:25:40.421 --> 00:25:41.500
There's also a memorandum

00:25:41.701 --> 00:25:43.500
outlining the acquisition background

00:25:43.861 --> 00:25:45.540
and newly

00:25:45.701 --> 00:25:46.740
negotiated terms.

00:25:46.981 --> 00:25:48.540
Feel free to contact

00:25:49.260 --> 00:25:52.020
Mr. Zhou and me anytime.

00:25:52.981 --> 00:25:54.260
Are we clear?

00:26:04.780 --> 00:26:05.621
Any questions?

00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:08.820
I skimmed the materials.

00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:09.820
Looks like we must each

00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:11.020
translate about 20 pages.

00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:12.580
Let's divide tasks now.

00:26:12.904 --> 00:26:13.540
Alright.

00:26:14.461 --> 00:26:16.780
I suggest the top two candidates
take the lead.

00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:17.861
One coordinator.

00:26:18.060 --> 00:26:18.981
One proofreader.

00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:21.300
Others split the translation work.

00:26:21.861 --> 00:26:22.580
The proofreader

00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:24.072
must work close to the deadline.

00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:26.141
Of course.

00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:27.181
Oh no.

00:26:27.181 --> 00:26:29.381
I've never read English contracts.

00:26:30.216 --> 00:26:33.221
Jiang, your English is the best.
Will you finalize the proofreading?

00:26:33.221 --> 00:26:34.740
I'd like to do the proofreading.

00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:39.461
I can proofread with Ren Jiatong.

00:26:39.780 --> 00:26:40.820
Also, I noticed that

00:26:40.820 --> 00:26:42.221
section one seems the toughest.

00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:43.780
I can take the first part.

00:26:44.780 --> 00:26:45.941
I'll team up with Jiang Chen.

00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:49.020
My English is not bad.

00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:52.181
Alright, let's hurry up.

00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:52.981
Allow me.

00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:55.861
Jiang Chen, Li Ke.
You two will handle section one.

00:26:56.260 --> 00:26:57.260
Wang Lu, Yan Fei.

00:26:57.260 --> 00:26:58.580
You two take section two.

00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:00.941
Huang Yue, Guo Xiaoyu, Ren Jiatong.

00:27:01.181 --> 00:27:02.740
The lengthy third section is yours.

00:27:02.981 --> 00:27:04.181
Jiang Chen, you'll review

00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:05.941
the translation with Ren Jiatong.

00:27:06.056 --> 00:27:06.600
Alright.

00:27:07.861 --> 00:27:09.340
Alright. Get to work.

00:27:13.181 --> 00:27:14.780
- Conference room.
- Let me grab my laptop.

00:27:14.780 --> 00:27:15.304
Alright.

00:27:37.381 --> 00:27:37.981
Something

00:27:37.981 --> 00:27:39.820
is wrong with
this supplemental agreement.

00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:46.740
Check the records in your memorandum.

00:27:46.901 --> 00:27:48.461
The client explicitly stated

00:27:48.461 --> 00:27:50.181
that they're acquiring Kern Company

00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:51.701
because they value Kern's

00:27:51.701 --> 00:27:53.661
semiconductor chip invention patent.

00:27:53.981 --> 00:27:55.181
They believe Kern

00:27:55.181 --> 00:27:57.340
has massive growth potential.

00:27:57.941 --> 00:27:58.820
But James Law Firm

00:27:58.820 --> 00:28:00.981
included this appendix
to the supplemental agreement

00:28:01.020 --> 00:28:01.820
that states

00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:04.621
Kern had previously licensed this patent

00:28:04.621 --> 00:28:06.421
to a third-party company,

00:28:06.421 --> 00:28:08.141
namely Kensit Company.

00:28:08.461 --> 00:28:11.461
And the license model is
an exclusive license.

00:28:12.421 --> 00:28:14.540
What is an exclusive license?

00:28:15.020 --> 00:28:16.300
Exclusive license

00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:17.820
means exclusive authorization.

00:28:18.221 --> 00:28:20.780
Once the patent
is granted to another party,

00:28:20.780 --> 00:28:22.461
even the rights holder

00:28:22.461 --> 00:28:23.461
loses usage rights.

00:28:23.740 --> 00:28:24.661
In other words,

00:28:24.701 --> 00:28:26.580
even if Kern is acquired,

00:28:26.621 --> 00:28:28.941
they can't use this patent anymore.

00:28:29.221 --> 00:28:30.181
This jeopardizes

00:28:30.181 --> 00:28:31.941
our client's expectation

00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:33.941
of substantial performance growth.

00:28:34.421 --> 00:28:35.820
But this agreement comes from

00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:37.020
the renowned James Law Firm.

00:28:37.421 --> 00:28:39.181
Rushing to criticize their work

00:28:39.421 --> 00:28:40.941
might be reckless.

00:28:42.701 --> 00:28:43.540
Ren Jiatong,

00:28:44.020 --> 00:28:46.120
maybe we should
focus on translating first.

00:28:46.540 --> 00:28:47.861
That's the test.

00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:48.780
If we

00:28:48.780 --> 00:28:50.540
can't finish on time,

00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:52.340
your review process

00:28:52.340 --> 00:28:53.340
will be hindered.

00:28:54.020 --> 00:28:54.941
Plus,

00:28:55.221 --> 00:28:57.100
the Warm Nest case remains unresolved.

00:28:57.260 --> 00:28:58.820
You can't afford mistakes this time.

00:29:32.181 --> 00:29:32.820
What's wrong?

00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:35.981
What's so funny?

00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:39.701
It's nothing.

00:29:41.701 --> 00:29:42.340
Actually,

00:29:42.981 --> 00:29:43.540
I...

00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:45.861
I kind of like you.

00:29:49.260 --> 00:29:49.820
Sorry, I...

00:29:49.820 --> 00:29:50.780
No.

00:29:50.981 --> 00:29:51.560
I mean

00:29:51.780 --> 00:29:52.780
I'm rooting for you.

00:29:53.780 --> 00:29:54.500
Rooting for you.

00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:56.181
Look at you.

00:29:56.621 --> 00:29:57.461
So professional

00:29:57.820 --> 00:29:58.701
and handsome.

00:29:59.780 --> 00:30:01.020
If I were as good-looking,

00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:02.340
I wouldn't be a lawyer.

00:30:03.020 --> 00:30:03.981
I'd hail a cab

00:30:03.981 --> 00:30:05.221
and charge into showbiz.

00:30:05.221 --> 00:30:06.340
Do some acting.

00:30:07.020 --> 00:30:08.020
Film dramas.

00:30:08.621 --> 00:30:09.340
Come on.

00:30:10.461 --> 00:30:11.540
You're good-looking too.

00:30:11.981 --> 00:30:12.500
But

00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:14.861
I think actors need more

00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:16.740
than just good looks.

00:30:17.901 --> 00:30:18.461
True.

00:30:22.181 --> 00:30:23.861
Let's take a break. Grab a bite?

00:30:23.981 --> 00:30:25.740
I-I have one page left.

00:30:26.580 --> 00:30:28.340
Go ahead if you're hungry.

00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:30.340
Alright.

00:30:30.621 --> 00:30:31.701
I'll get you coffee.

00:30:32.616 --> 00:30:33.224
Americano?

00:30:44.020 --> 00:30:45.300
Mr. Zhou, haven't you eaten?

00:30:46.141 --> 00:30:46.901
Nah, I worked.

00:30:46.901 --> 00:30:47.500
Hardworking.

00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:48.621
How's your team doing?

00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:51.141
Jiang Chen and I are doing well.

00:30:51.141 --> 00:30:53.181
We're working well with good synergy.

00:30:53.621 --> 00:30:54.260
Do a good job.

00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:56.540
The partners can see your performance.

00:30:56.780 --> 00:30:57.540
Yeah.

00:30:58.260 --> 00:30:59.621
Mr. Yang called and told me

00:30:59.621 --> 00:31:00.621
to take care of you.

00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:02.621
I told him not to worry.

00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:04.020
Everyone here

00:31:04.141 --> 00:31:04.901
is top talent.

00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:07.861
Thanks, you're the best.

00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:08.580
So nice.

00:31:09.224 --> 00:31:09.780
You know...

00:31:13.064 --> 00:31:13.621
Mr. Zhou,

00:31:14.181 --> 00:31:16.421
since we're divided into teams,

00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:17.820
the scores

00:31:18.661 --> 00:31:20.340
will be calculated

00:31:20.340 --> 00:31:22.020
by team, right?

00:31:22.661 --> 00:31:23.461
I don't think so.

00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:25.540
Based on my experience,

00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:27.901
each team usually has a high scorer

00:31:27.901 --> 00:31:28.621
and a low scorer.

00:31:33.740 --> 00:31:34.981
One high scorer?

00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:35.621
Yeah.

00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:39.421
Let's go.

00:32:02.901 --> 00:32:03.461
Yue.

00:32:04.820 --> 00:32:05.540
What's wrong?

00:32:08.540 --> 00:32:10.780
I ranked last in the previous test.

00:32:12.260 --> 00:32:13.340
I'm really anxious.

00:32:14.221 --> 00:32:14.861
I thought

00:32:15.340 --> 00:32:17.020
I should follow Ren Jiatong's example

00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:17.901
and find some work

00:32:17.901 --> 00:32:19.340
from other lawyers.

00:32:21.020 --> 00:32:21.820
I didn't know

00:32:21.820 --> 00:32:23.300
it'd overlap with the translation.

00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:25.780
Now I'm kind of caught

00:32:25.861 --> 00:32:26.861
in a dilemma.

00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:28.901
I can't delay either task.

00:32:30.540 --> 00:32:31.941
I got zero points last round.

00:32:32.260 --> 00:32:33.621
If I end up last again,

00:32:35.780 --> 00:32:37.381
I can just pack up and go home.

00:32:41.181 --> 00:32:41.901
Let me help you

00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:43.300
translate a few pages.

00:32:44.221 --> 00:32:45.861
But you have a heavy workload too.

00:32:46.020 --> 00:32:46.580
It's fine.

00:32:46.580 --> 00:32:48.381
I'll treat it as Legal English practice.

00:32:50.780 --> 00:32:52.020
Xiaoyu.

00:32:52.060 --> 00:32:53.060
Come on.

00:32:53.221 --> 00:32:54.621
You're so kind.

00:32:54.820 --> 00:32:55.740
Not at all.

00:32:55.941 --> 00:32:56.981
We help each other.

00:33:24.941 --> 00:33:26.740
I'm done with my part. Review it first.

00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:28.260
Impressive.

00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:29.421
How are you so fast?

00:33:29.701 --> 00:33:31.141
Did you grow up abroad?

00:33:31.661 --> 00:33:33.421
It happens to be one of my strengths.

00:33:33.820 --> 00:33:34.661
"One of"?

00:33:34.861 --> 00:33:36.580
Do you have any other impressive skills?

00:33:37.820 --> 00:33:39.221
I haven't encountered anything

00:33:39.221 --> 00:33:40.780
more interesting than being a lawyer.

00:33:40.780 --> 00:33:42.260
So I can't answer that for now.

00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:43.540
But I haven't failed anything

00:33:43.540 --> 00:33:44.500
I set my mind to.

00:33:45.701 --> 00:33:47.461
Yan Fei, you're awesome.

00:33:50.060 --> 00:33:51.381
You have so much to translate?

00:33:53.820 --> 00:33:55.820
Yan Fei, your group translates so fast.

00:33:56.580 --> 00:33:57.621
Is Wang Lu also done?

00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:01.820
We work separately.

00:34:01.901 --> 00:34:02.981
I'm faster.

00:34:03.381 --> 00:34:04.340
And it's a competition.

00:34:14.393 --> 00:34:16.168
(Sole license)

00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:30.344
(Please replace the ink cartridge)

00:34:49.261 --> 00:34:49.781
Thanks.

00:34:50.580 --> 00:34:51.100
No problem.

00:34:52.020 --> 00:34:53.020
After what happened,

00:34:53.020 --> 00:34:54.261
I studied every printer model

00:34:54.261 --> 00:34:56.220
at Jun An from top to bottom.

00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:06.220
You noticed too?

00:35:14.261 --> 00:35:15.060
I've been thinking.

00:35:15.461 --> 00:35:16.981
There are two possibilities.

00:35:17.220 --> 00:35:18.020
First, the agreement

00:35:18.341 --> 00:35:19.500
James Law Firm provided

00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:20.261
is correct.

00:35:20.421 --> 00:35:22.500
Our client made a wrong judgment.

00:35:22.620 --> 00:35:23.620
Maybe Kern Company

00:35:23.620 --> 00:35:25.580
granted the exclusive licensing rights

00:35:25.580 --> 00:35:26.660
and lost the ability

00:35:26.660 --> 00:35:27.861
to use this patent.

00:35:28.060 --> 00:35:28.781
Our client

00:35:28.781 --> 00:35:30.220
believed their empty promises

00:35:30.261 --> 00:35:32.341
and miscalculated
their future profitability.

00:35:32.421 --> 00:35:33.060
That's one.

00:35:33.540 --> 00:35:34.261
Second...

00:35:34.341 --> 00:35:35.180
Second possibility.

00:35:35.180 --> 00:35:36.941
In James Law Firm's agreement,

00:35:36.981 --> 00:35:39.421
the description
of this patent's prior licensing

00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:40.540
contains errors.

00:35:41.741 --> 00:35:42.660
They made a mistake.

00:35:47.781 --> 00:35:49.140
I have a question.

00:35:49.861 --> 00:35:51.941
Didn't we divide the task?

00:35:51.941 --> 00:35:52.981
I handle the first section

00:35:52.981 --> 00:35:54.020
and you handle the third.

00:35:54.421 --> 00:35:56.781
The term "exclusive license" appears

00:35:56.781 --> 00:35:58.700
on page 15 of my part, but appears

00:35:58.700 --> 00:35:59.781
on the first page of yours.

00:36:00.341 --> 00:36:00.981
You must have

00:36:00.981 --> 00:36:02.500
noticed it much earlier.

00:36:02.620 --> 00:36:03.461
Why haven't you

00:36:03.461 --> 00:36:05.301
mentioned it to Mr. Song or Mr. Zhou?

00:36:07.781 --> 00:36:08.620
Do you think

00:36:08.620 --> 00:36:09.700
that James Law Firm

00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:11.781
with decades of roots on Wall Street

00:36:12.020 --> 00:36:13.540
would make such elementary mistakes?

00:36:18.180 --> 00:36:19.580
Our top priority

00:36:19.741 --> 00:36:20.341
should be

00:36:20.341 --> 00:36:22.060
going over their original agreement

00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:22.821
right away.

00:36:23.741 --> 00:36:25.180
If we do that now,

00:36:25.180 --> 00:36:27.020
we'll never meet
the translation deadline.

00:36:27.461 --> 00:36:29.461
Plus, we're responsible
for the final review.

00:36:30.180 --> 00:36:31.981
We can't jeopardize everyone's work.

00:36:32.700 --> 00:36:33.580
Besides, the two of us

00:36:33.620 --> 00:36:34.500
can't review

00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:36.220
the whole file in such a limited time.

00:36:41.981 --> 00:36:43.020
Our primary duty

00:36:43.020 --> 00:36:45.180
as lawyers isn't submitting assignments

00:36:45.381 --> 00:36:46.620
but serving our clients.

00:36:46.941 --> 00:36:48.461
We've identified an issue.

00:36:48.500 --> 00:36:49.381
If we ignore it

00:36:49.540 --> 00:36:50.741
and let it become

00:36:51.020 --> 00:36:52.620
the dealbreaker one day,

00:36:52.620 --> 00:36:53.861
it will be our mistake.

00:36:54.540 --> 00:36:55.981
If the deal gets canceled,

00:36:56.180 --> 00:36:58.060
all our paperwork and translations

00:36:58.060 --> 00:36:59.020
become worthless.

00:36:59.341 --> 00:37:00.500
But think about it.

00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:02.421
If Jun An fails to
deliver the translation,

00:37:02.540 --> 00:37:03.220
within two days,

00:37:03.220 --> 00:37:05.020
the client won't even work with us.

00:37:05.341 --> 00:37:07.060
We won't get paid a single cent.

00:37:10.341 --> 00:37:11.220
Haven't you been

00:37:11.540 --> 00:37:12.341
even slightly

00:37:12.981 --> 00:37:15.020
affected by that video incident?

00:37:15.580 --> 00:37:18.152
Are you playing it safe now,
afraid to lose?

00:37:21.341 --> 00:37:21.861
Do you

00:37:21.861 --> 00:37:23.981
naturally enjoy rubbing salt in wounds?

00:37:24.421 --> 00:37:25.580
Is it wrong to be afraid?

00:37:37.421 --> 00:37:38.261
What's going on?

00:37:39.700 --> 00:37:40.220
Listen.

00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:42.220
Let's get everyone

00:37:42.700 --> 00:37:44.060
to vote. That's fairest.

00:37:44.392 --> 00:37:44.901
Alright.

00:37:46.981 --> 00:37:47.821
Everyone, look at

00:37:47.901 --> 00:37:48.981
the highlighted section.

00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:50.901
Ren Jiatong and I talked about this.

00:37:51.140 --> 00:37:52.861
From our client's perspective,

00:37:52.861 --> 00:37:54.540
this should actually be written

00:37:54.821 --> 00:37:55.660
as "sole license".

00:37:57.781 --> 00:38:00.100
Sole license means authorization

00:38:00.781 --> 00:38:03.220
where, after patent licensing,

00:38:03.461 --> 00:38:05.140
the licensor retains usage rights.

00:38:05.461 --> 00:38:06.700
If this holds true,

00:38:06.700 --> 00:38:07.700
our client's expectations

00:38:07.700 --> 00:38:09.620
for Kern Company's future performance

00:38:09.620 --> 00:38:10.500
would be secured.

00:38:11.741 --> 00:38:12.821
Top students indeed.

00:38:14.540 --> 00:38:15.580
I suggest

00:38:15.580 --> 00:38:16.620
we pause our translation

00:38:16.620 --> 00:38:17.700
at hand,

00:38:18.020 --> 00:38:20.220
find the original documents together

00:38:20.540 --> 00:38:21.620
and see whether

00:38:21.901 --> 00:38:23.381
James Law Firm made a mistake.

00:38:24.461 --> 00:38:26.020
How could they make mistakes?

00:38:26.461 --> 00:38:28.461
That's a top-five global firm.

00:38:29.020 --> 00:38:29.540
Jiang Chen.

00:38:30.020 --> 00:38:31.660
I know you're a Haryald elite.

00:38:31.660 --> 00:38:32.981
But are you really nitpicking

00:38:32.981 --> 00:38:33.941
a top-tier firm?

00:38:34.341 --> 00:38:36.500
We're only a few hours away
from the deadline.

00:38:36.660 --> 00:38:37.941
I haven't even had dinner.

00:38:38.220 --> 00:38:39.861
Can we be somewhat reasonable?

00:38:40.100 --> 00:38:41.500
The test is about translation.

00:38:41.861 --> 00:38:43.301
Creating extra complications

00:38:43.301 --> 00:38:45.261
will make us miss the deadline.

00:38:46.700 --> 00:38:47.660
True.

00:38:48.341 --> 00:38:49.981
This is just a speculation.

00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:51.781
What if we go through the documents

00:38:51.781 --> 00:38:53.620
only to find that they were right?

00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:54.941
We'd waste so much time

00:38:55.020 --> 00:38:56.500
and fail the test together.

00:38:57.060 --> 00:38:57.981
Here's what I think.

00:38:58.261 --> 00:38:59.381
Impressive though it is,

00:38:59.901 --> 00:39:01.861
James Law Firm
is just another law firm,

00:39:01.901 --> 00:39:02.821
just like Jun An.

00:39:03.140 --> 00:39:04.020
They're not gods.

00:39:04.540 --> 00:39:05.861
They can make mistakes too.

00:39:08.421 --> 00:39:09.060
No more debates.

00:39:09.540 --> 00:39:10.381
We're out of time.

00:39:10.781 --> 00:39:12.421
Majority rules, agreed?

00:39:13.941 --> 00:39:15.261
I vote to continue translating.

00:39:15.700 --> 00:39:16.901
Be done and go to sleep.

00:39:19.700 --> 00:39:20.500
I agree.

00:39:25.100 --> 00:39:25.981
I agree with Jiang Chen.

00:39:28.660 --> 00:39:29.620
Let's pause for now.

00:39:35.341 --> 00:39:35.941
Ren Jiatong.

00:39:36.301 --> 00:39:38.180
You caused the Warm Nest commotion.

00:39:38.381 --> 00:39:39.540
Are you dragging us

00:39:39.660 --> 00:39:41.220
down with you now?

00:39:41.540 --> 00:39:42.741
We're trying to be lawyers.

00:39:43.140 --> 00:39:44.060
Can't we be practical?

00:39:45.700 --> 00:39:46.500
Sorry.

00:39:46.540 --> 00:39:48.540
Let me ask a practical question.

00:39:49.261 --> 00:39:51.020
If we need the original documents now,

00:39:51.020 --> 00:39:52.580
we'd have to contact Mr. Song,

00:39:52.741 --> 00:39:54.461
and ask him to reach out to the client,

00:39:54.781 --> 00:39:56.580
who in turn would contact Kern.

00:39:57.341 --> 00:39:59.660
Wouldn't that involve too many people?

00:39:59.821 --> 00:40:00.941
Plus, it's so late.

00:40:00.941 --> 00:40:02.140
They're probably asleep.

00:40:02.941 --> 00:40:04.540
Isn't it inappropriate to contact

00:40:05.060 --> 00:40:06.020
Mr. Song now?

00:40:06.341 --> 00:40:07.421
Of course it is.

00:40:07.861 --> 00:40:09.901
If we disturb him so late at night,

00:40:09.901 --> 00:40:10.941
we'd upset him,

00:40:10.941 --> 00:40:11.700
a senior partner.

00:40:12.020 --> 00:40:13.421
What if he doesn't want us

00:40:13.700 --> 00:40:14.901
in his group?

00:40:15.060 --> 00:40:16.140
Then we'll suffer.

00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:20.741
Let's contact Mr. Zhou instead.

00:40:21.421 --> 00:40:22.421
He's probably asleep.

00:40:24.741 --> 00:40:25.381
Ren Jiatong.

00:40:25.620 --> 00:40:26.821
The seniors said that

00:40:26.821 --> 00:40:27.941
Ms. Bai returns tomorrow.

00:40:28.180 --> 00:40:30.140
The partners will discuss
whether you stay.

00:40:30.461 --> 00:40:31.421
Think about how to

00:40:31.421 --> 00:40:32.461
retain your position.

00:40:33.020 --> 00:40:33.781
Is this necessary?

00:40:43.381 --> 00:40:44.660
I was against it at first too.

00:40:45.301 --> 00:40:46.341
But a law firm

00:40:47.421 --> 00:40:48.620
isn't a school after all.

00:40:48.901 --> 00:40:50.301
We're not graded by scores,

00:40:50.301 --> 00:40:51.741
but by client satisfaction.

00:40:52.461 --> 00:40:54.180
Is it good enough
to translate the files?

00:40:55.020 --> 00:40:56.941
Seek truth not from authority,
but from facts.

00:40:57.781 --> 00:40:58.981
Is it hollow inspiration?

00:41:01.100 --> 00:41:02.660
If I were the client,

00:41:02.660 --> 00:41:03.620
I wouldn't want

00:41:03.941 --> 00:41:06.341
my lawyer to rush through tasks,

00:41:06.821 --> 00:41:08.580
instead of actually solving problems.

00:41:15.020 --> 00:41:16.301
I have a practical solution.

00:41:17.220 --> 00:41:18.381
Everyone keep translating.

00:41:18.660 --> 00:41:20.821
Yan Fei, Li Ke, and Wang Lu
can review together.

00:41:21.421 --> 00:41:22.220
Jiang Chen and I

00:41:22.220 --> 00:41:24.140
will check the agreement's annexes

00:41:24.341 --> 00:41:25.381
to see if we can find

00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:27.341
records of prior patent authorizations.

00:41:27.861 --> 00:41:29.660
We'll have something to submit

00:41:29.781 --> 00:41:31.140
and won't hold everyone back.

00:41:31.341 --> 00:41:32.421
If there is a problem,

00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:34.421
I'll explain to the mentors and request

00:41:34.540 --> 00:41:35.941
that they only deduct my points.

00:41:36.421 --> 00:41:36.941
How's that?

00:41:44.341 --> 00:41:45.180
I have points too.

00:41:47.020 --> 00:41:47.941
They can deduct points

00:41:48.301 --> 00:41:49.020
from both of us.

00:41:50.020 --> 00:41:50.741
What do you think?

00:42:06.248 --> 00:42:06.861
Get started.

00:42:28.700 --> 00:42:29.341
I'm off.

00:42:30.140 --> 00:42:30.821
Take care.

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:37.540
Bye.

00:42:45.301 --> 00:42:46.060
I'm off.

00:42:46.861 --> 00:42:47.741
- Bye.
- Bye.

00:42:47.741 --> 00:42:48.741
- Bye.
- Take care.

00:43:01.100 --> 00:43:01.620
Leaving?
