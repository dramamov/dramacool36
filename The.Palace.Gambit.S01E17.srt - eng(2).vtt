00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.944
(So, How Are You Going to Kill Me)

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.720
I suspect Consort Chun

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.720
wanted to steal that child too.

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.480
That's why Wan'er died there!

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.040
Please investigate it

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.440
and clear Wan'er's name.

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:33.840
How dare you two

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:35.760
collude to set me up!

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:36.352
Outrageous!

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.880
One is the head of the imperial harem.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.080
My favored consort.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.200
The other leads the Imperial Hospital.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.400
My trusted official.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:44.440
Yet you two

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:45.800
conspired against me

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.240
and lied about

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:48.280
my royal heir.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:49.720
Your crime

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:50.720
is unforgivable.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:52.600
Your Majesty.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.200
I merely desired a child of yours.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.520
Heaven and Earth
know my devotion to you.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.320
I merely made a mistake.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:02.920
Your Majesty.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.200
Consort Chun.

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.520
You've disappointed me deeply.

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:07.440
Your Majesty.

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.200
Hear my decree.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:10.800
Chief Physician Zhang

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.240
neglected duty

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.240
and deceived me.

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:14.400
His entire clan

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.760
shall be exterminated.

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:17.720
Consort Chun

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.080
is stripped

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.000
of her title

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.640
and confined forever.

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:22.760
Effective immediately.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.280
Your Majesty.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.480
How can you be so heartless?

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.480
I only wanted a child of yours.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.560
What did I do wrong?

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.320
Your Majesty.

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:39.000
Take her away.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.160
Your Majesty.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.760
Your Majesty.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.560
Your Majesty.

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.680
Spare me, Your Majesty.

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.560
Your Majesty.

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:01.560
Lady Shen,

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.280
I will do you justice.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.080
Rest well during pregnancy.

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:06.840
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.000
Hear my decree.

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.880
Noble Consort Xian of the Yongxiu Palace

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.400
shall be restored to her position.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:16.200
You protected

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.640
the royal heir,
but were unjustly punished.

00:02:19.264 --> 00:02:19.800
However,

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.560
your crime of spreading plague

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.960
negates

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.760
your merit.

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.640
Thank you

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:27.600
for your mercy.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.840
On behalf of Noble Consort Xian

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.920
and the Yongxiu Palace,

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.080
I kowtow in gratitude.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.160
- Rise.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:38.360
All of you,

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.120
treat the patients.

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:41.520
Should any mishap occur,

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.800
I'll kill you.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.560
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.880
Jiuning.

00:02:56.096 --> 00:02:56.720
Jiuning.

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:58.480
Lady Shen.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.600
I haven't fully recovered.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.760
Best keep your distance.

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:05.640
You're bearing a royal heir.

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:06.840
You should be careful.

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.120
It's raining. Please go back.

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.600
Thank you, Jiuning.

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:33.160
(Wan'er.)

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:35.320
(Are you watching?)

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:37.840
(Are those your tears?)

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.160
(Those who put you in the Cold Palace,)

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:42.440
(who stood so high)

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:43.840
(and trampled our fates,)

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:45.800
(have been overthrown by me.)

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.520
(But those who took your life)

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.240
(still roam free.)

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:54.480
(Wait a little longer.)

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.240
(I will surely)

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.360
(send her before you.)

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:16.880
You've finally come.

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:19.920
Here to avenge your sister?

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:24.720
The once-invincible,

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.400
all-powerful Consort Chun

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:29.360
has been reduced to this.

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.880
How are you coping?

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:34.880
My father and brother

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.000
are generals who have
safeguarded the nation

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.720
and rendered outstanding service,

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.240
deeply trusted by His Majesty

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.880
and respected
by every official in court.

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:47.920
Such prestige.

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.800
Yet now I've been bested
by a mere palace maid.

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:56.800
How absurd.

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.080
You mocked me as an ant trying

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.320
to topple a tree because you failed

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:02.440
to see

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.440
that all people are equal in dignity.

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.200
Even the lowliest ant

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:08.720
has the right to survive.

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:10.600
We won't tolerate

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:12.600
your ruthless trampling.

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:15.160
I must admit this.

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:17.880
A humble maid like you,

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.320
without power or status,

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.160
has matched wits with me,
an imperial consort

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:24.520
with prestige.

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:28.400
I underestimated you.

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.560
I thought you couldn't fight back.

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:33.240
Yet you advanced strategically

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.680
and actually

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:37.520
took me down.

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:39.400
I never wanted this.

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:42.880
Wan'er and I

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:44.840
entered the palace only to survive.

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:46.800
Even if treated as inferiors,

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.200
even if ignored by all,

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:51.680
we just wanted to live.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:52.880
That's all we wanted.

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:54.960
But you

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:00.520
shattered our last shred of hope
with your own hands.

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:09.000
Enough.

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:11.480
So,

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:13.200
how are you going to kill me?

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:15.360
Since I've lost,

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:16.800
I accept defeat.

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:21.000
Who killed

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:22.920
Wan'er?

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.720
You're quite something.

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:30.320
You asked the right question.

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:32.360
No shame in losing to you.

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:35.920
At first, I thought

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:38.520
you killed Wan'er

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:39.720
out of jealousy.

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:41.320
But when I learned

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:43.760
that you tried to steal
Lady Shen's child,

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:45.240
I realized that

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:48.400
Wan'er was targeted precisely because

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:49.480
she was pregnant.

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:51.560
You put her in the Cold Palace,

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:54.080
intending to steal her newborn child.

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:55.600
That was your real plan.

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:57.440
You wouldn't have

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:00.320
killed her before the child was born.

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:02.280
So the real killer

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:04.560
must be someone else.

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:06.560
You're quite something.

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:09.360
So thoughtful.

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:12.160
Who most opposes your rise?

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:16.440
Who dreads your possible ascension

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:18.880
through motherhood?

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:22.800
It doesn't matter now.

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:24.760
I don't care.

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:27.200
You have the answer.

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:29.720
Is it Consort Shu?

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:35.080
Consort Shu?

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:48.080
I've been thinking

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:50.440
who most envies your glory.

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:52.280
It's most likely Consort Shu.

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:53.680
Though equal in rank,

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:56.080
she's languished beneath you,

00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:58.800
enduring your scorn

00:07:58.800 --> 00:07:59.720
and humiliation.

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:02.560
She wouldn't submit to you.

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:04.520
Is it her?

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.400
This imperial harem

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:12.480
is full of

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:16.200
deception and double-dealing.

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:17.480
It could be anyone.

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:21.520
You're the one who caused my downfall.

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:23.960
How I wish to tear you apart

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:25.000
and flay your flesh.

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:30.200
Yet you expect me to name the killer

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:33.000
and share clues with you?

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:40.600
Even without your tips,

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:43.320
I'll uncover the truth myself.

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:45.280
I defeated you,

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:47.440
a prestigious consort of high power.

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:50.880
Of course, I can
get to the bottom of this

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:53.360
and catch this cowardly schemer

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:57.080
who strikes from the shadows.

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:10.680
Your Highness,

00:09:11.232 --> 00:09:11.760
I will never

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:13.240
forget your help.

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:15.600
Rise.

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:21.160
I know

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:23.360
Your Highness assisted me.

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:26.560
You scolded me harshly

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:27.920
and kicked me out

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:31.560
because you knew my intentions

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:32.840
and were willing to

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:34.640
lend me your support.

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:39.120
It's all thanks to
your own efforts and virtue.

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:43.520
I almost

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:45.320
implicated Your Highness

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:47.240
and all your subordinates.

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:49.200
I came here

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:51.200
to apologize.

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:52.720
Please punish me.

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:08.160
You serve in the Yongxiu Palace.

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:09.760
Just remember this.

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:12.320
We stand united,

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:13.320
sharing

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:14.520
weal and woe.

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:16.080
Your problems

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:17.360
are my problems

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:19.840
and concern all of us.

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:21.680
I will not,

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:22.960
nor will I ever

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:24.560
allow your reckless behavior

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:26.400
to endanger others.

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:28.040
Now,

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:30.200
Consort Chun is confined in her palace.

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:32.600
As the saying goes,

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:34.840
"To resist temptation is true virtue."

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:37.640
Stop causing trouble from now on.

00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:40.600
If you cause further disturbances,

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:42.120
I will not

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:43.920
show mercy.

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:46.120
Understood.

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:49.360
I will behave.

00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:56.288
(Jingfu Palace)

00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:58.040
Miss.

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:02.520
What brings you here?

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:03.800
I'm Lu Jiuning

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:05.400
from the Yongxiu Palace.

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:08.760
Consort Shu helped me a few days ago.

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:10.160
I've come to show gratitude.

00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:11.480
Miss Jiuning.

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:12.240
This way.

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:18.880
Your Highness,

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:20.800
Lu Jiuning
of the Yongxiu Palace is here.

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:22.240
Your Highness.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.200
I'm Lu Jiuning.

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:26.440
I've come to thank Your Highness.

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:36.000
Since you are resting,

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:37.120
I'll come again.

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:39.600
This is weird.

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:41.160
Surong is usually here

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:42.440
when Her Highness naps.

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:44.280
Why is no one here today?

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:48.040
(Oh no.)

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:51.800
Assassin!

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:52.720
Assassin!

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:53.840
Assassin!

00:11:56.128 --> 00:11:56.720
Your Highness.

00:11:57.760 --> 00:11:58.360
Your Highness.

00:12:03.232 --> 00:12:03.800
Hurry.

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:04.928
Summon Imperial Physicians.

00:12:04.928 --> 00:12:05.504
Understood.

00:12:05.504 --> 00:12:06.360
Audacious villain.

00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:07.880
How dare you eunuch

00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:09.520
attempt to kill me?

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.040
Who sent you?

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:17.880
Xiao Zhuozi.

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:20.840
Why did you do this?

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:22.280
What insolence!

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:24.840
The Yongxiu Palace sent an assassin!

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:28.520
Guards.

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:31.120
Send this scoundrel

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:33.840
to the Punishment Bureau
for interrogation.

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:37.680
He bit his tongue off.

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:52.560
This is horrible.

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:54.800
This is terrifying.

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:56.960
Why would he want me dead?

00:12:57.760 --> 00:12:58.440
Your Highness,

00:12:58.720 --> 00:12:59.920
I was too careless.

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:02.400
Someone called me
to inspect your new gown.

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:04.720
Had Miss Jiuning not intervened,

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:06.120
you would've been killed.

00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:08.520
Thank you, Miss Jiuning.

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:10.480
Don't mention it, Surong.

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:12.800
When I was in trouble,

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:15.960
Consort Shu and you helped me out.

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:18.920
I came to show my gratitude today

00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:19.920
and happened

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:21.720
to run into the villain.

00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:23.760
It's our duty

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:25.320
to protect our masters.

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:26.480
Jiuning.

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:28.200
I helped you

00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:29.960
out of compassion

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:31.640
for you.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.240
You don't owe me anything.

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:36.760
Your Highness treats everyone

00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:37.520
kindly.

00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:39.840
How did you offend anyone?

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:41.640
I seek nothing

00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:43.920
more than self-preservation.

00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:47.080
Perhaps I was too close to Consort Chun.

00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:49.200
Now that she's fallen,

00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:50.960
I will be

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:52.960
taken down with her.

00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:54.400
Your Highness.

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:56.320
Even if you lack powerful

00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:57.080
connections,

00:13:57.560 --> 00:13:59.520
you now hold the noble rank of Consort.

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:01.840
How dare they disregard the law?

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:02.880
They can't

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:04.000
just bully you.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:04.560
Surong.

00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:05.920
Mind your words.

00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:11.840
(Consort Shu sounds like)

00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:13.960
(she's implying something.)

00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:18.480
(What kind of person is she?)

00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:20.760
(Why did Xiao Zhuozi)

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:22.880
(try to assassinate Consort Shu?)

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:27.000
(Is it related to Noble Consort Xian?)

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:30.720
Your Highness, please take care.

00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:32.360
I will leave you to rest.

00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:34.040
I take my leave.

00:14:46.784 --> 00:14:47.360
Xiaotao.

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:50.160
Miss Jiuning.

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:51.920
Her Highness says

00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:53.680
it's been rainy these days.

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:55.360
The sun is out today.

00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:58.400
Let's move the flowers
outside for the sun

00:14:58.560 --> 00:14:59.160
and trim them

00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:00.160
a bit.

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:01.360
We're on it.

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:06.360
Weren't there

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:09.240
several pots of Her Highness's
favorite balsams?

00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:10.440
Where are those?

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:11.880
Forget it.

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:13.560
Those balsams

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:14.800
all died.

00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:16.440
They died?

00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:17.120
Yeah.

00:15:17.312 --> 00:15:17.880
Why?

00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:20.360
They were thriving before.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.120
How did they die?

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:26.000
Xiao Zhuozi has been careless

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:27.280
at work these days.

00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:28.440
Somehow,

00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:30.840
he killed all those balsams.

00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:32.640
And he intentionally

00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:35.520
broke the vase
His Majesty gifted to Her Highness.

00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:36.720
She was furious

00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:37.640
and punished him.

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:40.080
Intentionally?

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:42.600
Days before his death,

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:46.360
he became neglectful
of Her Highness's orders,

00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:48.320
shirking responsibilities

00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:49.280
all day.

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:51.040
Xiaotao. It's getting late.

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:52.200
Hurry up.

00:15:52.832 --> 00:15:53.376
Alright.

00:15:58.520 --> 00:15:59.160
Xiao Luzi.

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:00.280
I have a question.

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:01.680
- Xiao Zhuozi...
- Please.

00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:02.440
Miss Jiuning.

00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:03.640
Xiao Zhuozi...

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:06.640
Xiao Zhuozi is in trouble.

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:08.800
We're not allowed to discuss him.

00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:11.480
Xiao Luzi.

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:14.480
You worked with Xiao Zhuozi for years.

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:16.840
Don't you think his death

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:18.720
is suspicious?

00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:22.200
It does seem odd.

00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:24.280
A few nights ago,

00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:27.160
I saw him secretly wiping tears

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:28.400
while muttering

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:29.680
things like,

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:31.480
"There's no way out".

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:34.400
(Could it be)

00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:37.080
(that Her Highness forced Xiao Zhuozi)

00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:38.760
(to assassinate Consort Shu?)
