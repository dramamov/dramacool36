(This story is a work of fiction)

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.960
=Episode 21=

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.841
No more pickles.

00:01:47.841 --> 00:01:49.360
Don't fill up on pickles now.

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:50.561
- Here.
- Coming.

00:01:50.561 --> 00:01:53.201
One bowl of soul-reviving noodles
to cure fatigue.

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:54.681
Come on.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.921
Careful, it's hot.

00:01:55.921 --> 00:01:57.800
Slow down.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.121
Let me handle that.

00:01:59.121 --> 00:02:01.401
I love the noodles
Quecha makes. So tasty.

00:02:01.401 --> 00:02:02.160
Right.

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.360
Slow down.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:04.240
Some toppings.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:05.761
Eat with us.

00:02:05.761 --> 00:02:06.561
Fantastic.

00:02:06.641 --> 00:02:07.520
Come on.

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:09.121
Smells amazing.

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.081
Can we finish it all?

00:02:10.081 --> 00:02:10.961
My turn now?

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:12.361
Hold on.

00:02:13.121 --> 00:02:14.841
Your snoring kept everyone awake.

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.561
When do I snore?

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.480
Not just snoring,
you grind your teeth too.

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.600
Why not mention his farting?

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.401
Who? You're the farter.

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:24.521
It's from Jiang's phone.

00:02:24.521 --> 00:02:25.200
Give me some too.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.880
Here.

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:27.281
(Jiang Baichuan)
Who wants more toppings?

00:02:27.561 --> 00:02:28.561
No more for me.

00:02:29.241 --> 00:02:30.241
Just got more.

00:02:31.521 --> 00:02:32.281
Delicious.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.521
How are my people?

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.001
Earth Fiends are tough.

00:02:48.121 --> 00:02:49.600
They won't die easily.

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:52.841
But under my watch,

00:02:53.561 --> 00:02:55.160
we've got many hot-headed hunters.

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.640
They might lose control
if this drags on.

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.600
True, Earth Fiends are resilient.

00:03:06.801 --> 00:03:09.600
But Jiang Baichuan isn't an Earth Fiend.

00:03:11.241 --> 00:03:12.640
Those four Earth Fiends

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.040
must be important to you.

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.640
Why else did you hide them so securely?

00:03:17.841 --> 00:03:19.521
Since we both have bargaining chips,

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.081
let's negotiate directly.

00:03:24.121 --> 00:03:25.720
All terms are on the table.

00:03:26.001 --> 00:03:27.281
Nothing left to negotiate.

00:03:27.801 --> 00:03:30.801
Fine. Five for five then.

00:03:32.521 --> 00:03:35.760
Jiang Baichuan and four hunters

00:03:36.281 --> 00:03:38.160
for my four companions

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:40.521
and Lin Ling.

00:03:41.401 --> 00:03:44.001
I don't know any Lin Ling.

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:45.640
She's not here.

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.841
But I have not just four fresh ones

00:03:50.001 --> 00:03:52.121
but also an old friend of yours.

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:53.241
Who?

00:03:53.841 --> 00:03:54.521
Chen Fu.

00:04:02.801 --> 00:04:06.081
(Quecha)
How about adding one more each?

00:04:09.361 --> 00:04:10.401
Meaning?

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.081
Besides Jiang Baichuan
and four other hunters,

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:15.720
I want one more person.

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:17.241
Who is it?

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:20.561
Yan Tuo.

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:22.131
You won't eat thrown-down food.

00:05:22.371 --> 00:05:25.050
You'll take it
if I deliver it personally, right?

00:05:36.234 --> 00:05:37.073
Got a mirror?

00:05:41.874 --> 00:05:42.513
Why?

00:05:45.794 --> 00:05:46.874
Just want to see

00:05:47.994 --> 00:05:49.474
if I still look human.

00:05:55.466 --> 00:05:56.106
Thanks.

00:05:56.714 --> 00:05:58.515
You're throwing away a good life.

00:06:00.594 --> 00:06:01.274
Is it worth it?

00:06:03.594 --> 00:06:06.435
I thought of all people...

00:06:07.395 --> 00:06:08.994
you'd be the one to believe me.

00:06:12.474 --> 00:06:13.794
How can I believe you?

00:06:35.635 --> 00:06:37.594
Xiong, Feng insisted...

00:06:45.195 --> 00:06:45.794
Xiong Hei.

00:07:00.234 --> 00:07:02.354
Four of my closest companions

00:07:02.474 --> 00:07:03.994
disappeared together.

00:07:05.075 --> 00:07:06.794
Do you know what happened?

00:07:08.394 --> 00:07:10.075
I've been locked up here.

00:07:10.435 --> 00:07:12.354
How would I know about outside affairs?

00:07:13.594 --> 00:07:14.474
Where's Lin Ling?

00:07:15.195 --> 00:07:16.394
Where is she now?

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:20.810
Lin Ling is also missing?

00:07:22.971 --> 00:07:26.251
Xiong, what's going on with you?

00:07:26.731 --> 00:07:29.211
How could you be so careless
as to lose five people at once?

00:07:29.491 --> 00:07:31.890
The South Mountain Hunters
proposed a hostage exchange.

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:34.650
They want to trade
four of our missing members

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:35.890
for Jiang Baichuan

00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:37.410
and

00:07:38.251 --> 00:07:39.971
another person.

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:42.170
Guess who?

00:07:45.834 --> 00:07:47.393
If you don't trust me,

00:07:49.514 --> 00:07:51.954
everything that happens
would somehow be my fault.

00:07:52.474 --> 00:07:52.954
What else...

00:07:52.954 --> 00:07:53.594
It's you.

00:08:04.153 --> 00:08:06.033
The extra exchange target is you.

00:08:08.594 --> 00:08:09.594
Me?

00:08:12.106 --> 00:08:13.506
You've always been like this.

00:08:14.346 --> 00:08:18.067
Obedient and compliant on the surface,

00:08:19.187 --> 00:08:23.027
but when you make mistakes,
you'll never admit them.

00:08:24.506 --> 00:08:26.147
Unless I catch you red-handed,

00:08:26.947 --> 00:08:28.787
you'll take the denial to your grave.

00:08:30.538 --> 00:08:31.379
In fifth grade,

00:08:33.219 --> 00:08:35.178
I remember it was summer,

00:08:35.578 --> 00:08:36.739
and I lied to you,

00:08:38.578 --> 00:08:40.899
telling you school
required 50 yuan for materials.

00:08:43.019 --> 00:08:45.979
But secretly, I used that money

00:08:47.139 --> 00:08:48.339
to buy CDs.

00:08:49.098 --> 00:08:50.458
Later, when you did laundry,

00:08:50.539 --> 00:08:52.018
you found 10 yuan left in my pocket.

00:08:53.978 --> 00:08:56.378
You claimed the teacher
praised your grades

00:08:57.338 --> 00:08:58.419
and gave us a discount.

00:08:59.179 --> 00:09:01.019
Then you gave me another 100 yuan,

00:09:03.858 --> 00:09:06.179
telling me to buy whatever I wanted.

00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:09.730
You said,

00:09:11.129 --> 00:09:12.210
"My child"

00:09:13.809 --> 00:09:16.490
"should never skulk around timidly."

00:09:18.250 --> 00:09:19.570
"If you want something,"

00:09:20.289 --> 00:09:22.730
"claim it openly and boldly."

00:09:24.490 --> 00:09:27.809
"Even if you must seize it,"

00:09:29.049 --> 00:09:30.289
"satisfy your desires."

00:09:37.090 --> 00:09:39.490
I won't give you 100 yuan this time.

00:09:41.409 --> 00:09:43.370
I've given you too many chances,

00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:46.330
all squandered by you.

00:10:06.009 --> 00:10:06.850
I'm sorry.

00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:10.210
I truly

00:10:13.129 --> 00:10:14.730
considered you family all along.

00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:16.690
I genuinely wanted

00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:20.370
to live harmoniously with you.

00:10:31.690 --> 00:10:32.649
What a pity

00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:38.769
that I happened to read that diary.

00:10:42.049 --> 00:10:42.850
It was you

00:10:43.929 --> 00:10:45.409
who killed my parents.

00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:48.570
Did you think stealing Lin Xirou's name

00:10:50.289 --> 00:10:52.009
and inheriting Roadsound Mining

00:10:52.009 --> 00:10:53.330
would make you my mother?

00:10:54.009 --> 00:10:56.250
That you could become a proper human?

00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:00.850
You're no Lin Xirou.

00:11:02.769 --> 00:11:03.450
No.

00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:06.289
You all

00:11:07.649 --> 00:11:10.169
aren't even worthy
of having human names.

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:12.850
Lin Xirou called using Jiang's phone.

00:12:13.090 --> 00:12:14.370
She proposed a hostage exchange.

00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:16.169
Perfect.

00:12:17.409 --> 00:12:18.929
She's starting to get anxious.

00:12:20.730 --> 00:12:21.690
How did your talk go?

00:12:23.049 --> 00:12:24.850
We just showed each other our cards.

00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:27.370
We haven't gotten to the details yet.

00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:29.289
That's why I

00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:34.490
called you first to discuss it

00:12:35.049 --> 00:12:36.450
to see how we should proceed.

00:12:39.274 --> 00:12:40.115
I've moved Lin Ling

00:12:40.115 --> 00:12:41.514
to a secure location.

00:12:43.274 --> 00:12:44.995
If Lin Xirou bargains,

00:12:45.235 --> 00:12:46.315
use it to string her along.

00:12:46.674 --> 00:12:49.554
No wonder Lin Xirou
also mentioned Lin Ling.

00:12:49.794 --> 00:12:51.955
But I didn't know
you had already rescued her.

00:12:52.195 --> 00:12:53.434
So I didn't respond.

00:12:53.715 --> 00:12:55.955
It's fine. It was an emergency.

00:12:58.674 --> 00:13:00.355
But I mentioned another person.

00:13:02.995 --> 00:13:03.595
Who?

00:13:05.514 --> 00:13:06.195
Yan Tuo.

00:13:11.914 --> 00:13:14.115
W-What are you saying?

00:13:14.875 --> 00:13:17.434
You said Lin Xirou confined him,

00:13:17.875 --> 00:13:19.034
and you wanted to save him.

00:13:19.794 --> 00:13:20.835
So I thought

00:13:21.355 --> 00:13:22.554
we could use him

00:13:22.554 --> 00:13:23.835
as an exchange bargaining chip.

00:13:23.914 --> 00:13:25.554
You told Lin Xirou

00:13:26.514 --> 00:13:28.075
we want Yan Tuo in exchange?

00:13:31.875 --> 00:13:33.715
Lin Xirou was already
suspecting Yan Tuo.

00:13:33.955 --> 00:13:36.075
You confirmed her suspicions
about him as a traitor.

00:13:36.595 --> 00:13:38.634
Creating more chaos for them

00:13:38.858 --> 00:13:40.537
gives us better odds.

00:13:41.817 --> 00:13:42.618
Xing Shen,

00:13:43.754 --> 00:13:45.034
from beginning to end,

00:13:46.713 --> 00:13:48.433
you've only cared about yourself.

00:16:19.434 --> 00:16:21.833
Why are humans afraid of the dark?

00:16:26.194 --> 00:16:28.954
Humans aren't afraid of the dark.

00:16:29.714 --> 00:16:31.313
They're afraid of the unknown.

00:16:32.874 --> 00:16:34.833
When everything is clear and obvious,

00:16:35.634 --> 00:16:37.073
and there's no unknown,

00:16:37.954 --> 00:16:39.313
then we're afraid of nothing.

00:16:39.833 --> 00:16:41.793
If the unknown doesn't even exist,

00:16:42.674 --> 00:16:45.434
then reverence vanishes.

00:16:46.394 --> 00:16:48.474
Humans always make similar mistakes.

00:16:49.313 --> 00:16:52.234
They tend to cross boundaries
that should be respected.

00:16:57.553 --> 00:16:59.073
Since you look down on humans so much,

00:17:01.154 --> 00:17:02.593
why insist on being human then?

00:17:03.914 --> 00:17:05.394
We're also afraid of the dark.

00:17:08.073 --> 00:17:11.954
As long as our kind can live in peace,

00:17:12.634 --> 00:17:15.273
without fear and panic,

00:17:15.914 --> 00:17:17.234
we'll do whatever it takes.

00:17:18.674 --> 00:17:21.234
But this privilege is only granted

00:17:21.833 --> 00:17:22.513
to humans.

00:17:25.753 --> 00:17:28.593
Humans earned these rights
through effort,

00:17:29.234 --> 00:17:32.793
not by consuming human flesh and blood.

00:17:34.474 --> 00:17:35.194
Right.

00:17:36.513 --> 00:17:38.154
Efforts to create wars,

00:17:38.474 --> 00:17:40.194
efforts to spread diseases,

00:17:40.994 --> 00:17:44.154
massacring countless lives
yet being glorified for eternity.

00:17:46.714 --> 00:17:48.033
All I wanted

00:17:48.313 --> 00:17:51.194
was to build a home under the sun.

00:17:51.833 --> 00:17:53.833
Yet I'm labeled as utterly evil.

00:17:54.986 --> 00:17:56.066
I brought you here

00:17:56.667 --> 00:17:59.026
because this is where I originated.

00:17:59.986 --> 00:18:02.107
Humans and fiends,
and fiends and humans.

00:18:02.867 --> 00:18:05.347
No need to distinguish them here.

00:18:09.387 --> 00:18:11.147
This will be your home from now on.

00:18:13.306 --> 00:18:15.546
Since everything's laid bare,

00:18:16.546 --> 00:18:18.147
you have nothing to fear.

00:18:20.706 --> 00:18:21.387
Home?

00:18:22.706 --> 00:18:23.786
I can't remember

00:18:24.466 --> 00:18:27.746
how many years it's been
since I had my own home.

00:18:29.026 --> 00:18:30.667
Do you think I still have a home?

00:18:33.147 --> 00:18:34.667
The only one in this world

00:18:34.667 --> 00:18:36.667
that let me pretend to be human

00:18:37.347 --> 00:18:38.107
was you.

00:18:39.706 --> 00:18:40.627
But Tuo,

00:18:41.587 --> 00:18:42.347
without you,

00:18:42.947 --> 00:18:44.266
I lose my home too.

00:18:45.347 --> 00:18:47.107
You've deceived me many times,

00:18:48.066 --> 00:18:49.387
but none of it was your fault.

00:18:50.546 --> 00:18:52.706
The one helping you deceive me
wasn't Lin Ling,

00:18:52.786 --> 00:18:53.907
Lv Xian,

00:18:54.147 --> 00:18:56.427
or your artist girlfriend.

00:18:58.090 --> 00:19:00.449
Your greatest accomplice all along

00:19:03.489 --> 00:19:04.370
was me.

00:19:07.130 --> 00:19:07.930
I helped you

00:19:07.930 --> 00:19:10.249
deceive myself repeatedly,

00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:12.170
convincing myself.

00:19:19.810 --> 00:19:20.890
But such things

00:19:21.729 --> 00:19:22.890
won't happen again.

00:19:25.370 --> 00:19:26.170
Because 'home'

00:19:26.170 --> 00:19:28.769
is just a fabricated concept of yours.

00:19:30.130 --> 00:19:31.090
Better off without it.

00:19:33.850 --> 00:19:36.610
I have my own kind, my clan.

00:19:37.249 --> 00:19:39.449
They're what truly matter to me.

00:19:49.049 --> 00:19:50.410
From today onward,

00:19:51.330 --> 00:19:53.769
humans stay human,
and fiends stay fiends.

00:19:54.489 --> 00:19:56.810
We'll keep clear boundaries.

00:20:35.850 --> 00:20:37.610
Only this much after purification?

00:20:38.771 --> 00:20:42.451
It resembles a jellyfish
with a jade sheen.

00:20:42.850 --> 00:20:44.090
This must be it.

00:20:45.650 --> 00:20:48.330
Jellyfish.

00:20:49.850 --> 00:20:51.850
Edible jellyfish, delicious.

00:20:53.810 --> 00:20:55.090
We can't eat this.

00:20:57.771 --> 00:20:59.370
Though we could let it try.

00:21:25.251 --> 00:21:25.931
Never mind.

00:21:27.650 --> 00:21:28.451
Yan Tuo?

00:21:28.691 --> 00:21:29.370
Don't save me.

00:21:31.171 --> 00:21:31.931
Let go.

00:23:15.786 --> 00:23:22.097
(Peaceful)

00:23:22.097 --> 00:23:28.232
(Homecoming)

00:23:39.406 --> 00:23:43.244
(Lu,)

00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:48.889
(you've got some
unconventional connections.)

00:23:48.889 --> 00:23:51.850
(Investigate
Roadsound Group's assets for me.)

00:23:51.850 --> 00:23:54.689
(The more detailed, the better.)

00:24:12.409 --> 00:24:14.850
Ms. Lin, what's this about?

00:24:17.969 --> 00:24:19.250
To remind me

00:24:20.449 --> 00:24:24.209
to never develop feelings
for humans again.

00:24:25.570 --> 00:24:28.050
I've deployed all available personnel

00:24:28.050 --> 00:24:30.169
to search for Lin Ling.

00:24:30.449 --> 00:24:31.489
Don't worry, Ms. Lin.

00:24:31.929 --> 00:24:33.889
I'll definitely bring Lin Ling back.

00:24:36.209 --> 00:24:37.570
I hope it's not too late.

00:24:51.530 --> 00:24:55.050
(Nie Jiuluo)

00:24:58.506 --> 00:24:59.385
Shen,

00:25:00.425 --> 00:25:03.705
could Earth Fiends actually be humans?

00:25:05.506 --> 00:25:06.145
What?

00:25:08.266 --> 00:25:15.826
Humans combined
with other species' genes became fiends.

00:25:16.625 --> 00:25:19.105
Lin Xirou has a method

00:25:19.105 --> 00:25:22.865
to reverse Yuwang Meat's effects

00:25:22.865 --> 00:25:24.986
and strip away the other genes.

00:25:25.266 --> 00:25:26.625
Are you saying

00:25:27.546 --> 00:25:29.385
they don't become human

00:25:30.945 --> 00:25:32.506
but revert to being human?

00:25:34.466 --> 00:25:37.066
I... I don't know.

00:25:38.945 --> 00:25:40.026
Wild guesses.

00:25:41.145 --> 00:25:41.945
Exactly.

00:25:42.546 --> 00:25:43.665
This explains

00:25:45.625 --> 00:25:47.586
how they came into being

00:25:48.826 --> 00:25:50.865
and how they became human.

00:25:51.506 --> 00:25:52.905
All of it makes sense now.

00:25:55.826 --> 00:25:57.145
If Yuwang Meat

00:25:57.945 --> 00:26:00.145
can enable both genetic fusion

00:26:01.546 --> 00:26:03.345
and reverse separation,

00:26:05.786 --> 00:26:07.306
then its applications

00:26:09.905 --> 00:26:11.226
would be endless.

00:26:13.425 --> 00:26:15.226
It can do good deeds

00:26:18.105 --> 00:26:20.826
and evil ones.

00:26:26.986 --> 00:26:28.145
Keep it safe first.

00:26:29.105 --> 00:26:29.945
Let's go check.

00:26:31.425 --> 00:26:32.226
Be good.

00:26:32.385 --> 00:26:34.665
Spend the New Year
with Grandma and Grandpa first.

00:26:34.865 --> 00:26:36.586
After the holidays when school starts,

00:26:36.786 --> 00:26:38.226
I will take you to school, okay?

00:26:38.226 --> 00:26:39.226
(Okay.)

00:26:39.786 --> 00:26:41.145
Isn't this my grown-up girl?

00:26:41.226 --> 00:26:42.466
Say hi to Uncle Qiang.

00:26:42.586 --> 00:26:43.586
Call me Dad.

00:26:44.385 --> 00:26:45.865
Got the stuff.

00:26:46.625 --> 00:26:47.226
Hurry up.

00:26:47.705 --> 00:26:48.625
Red packets?

00:26:48.625 --> 00:26:49.345
Happy New Year!

00:26:50.226 --> 00:26:51.226
- Happy New Year!
- I need to go.

00:26:51.826 --> 00:26:53.026
- Happy New Year!
- Talk later.

00:26:53.306 --> 00:26:54.586
- Move!
- Move!

00:26:54.705 --> 00:26:55.466
Ma, you pick first.

00:26:56.345 --> 00:26:56.986
Take more.

00:26:58.746 --> 00:26:59.506
Take more.

00:26:59.705 --> 00:27:00.625
I want that one.

00:27:00.625 --> 00:27:01.546
Grab a handful.

00:27:02.185 --> 00:27:03.066
Thanks.

00:27:04.226 --> 00:27:04.945
Listen...

00:27:06.465 --> 00:27:08.506
- When did you buy this?
- When did you buy this?

00:27:09.026 --> 00:27:10.066
You told me to buy it.

00:27:12.826 --> 00:27:14.665
It's New Year. Let's celebrate.

00:27:14.786 --> 00:27:15.986
Didn't we agree before?

00:27:15.986 --> 00:27:17.826
No alcohol at base during missions.

00:27:18.945 --> 00:27:19.466
Fine.

00:27:20.026 --> 00:27:22.026
I'll drink outside the base then, okay?

00:27:26.986 --> 00:27:27.625
Who are you?

00:27:27.945 --> 00:27:28.826
How did you get in?

00:27:29.826 --> 00:27:31.145
Who's she? No idea.

00:27:32.026 --> 00:27:32.905
Luo.

00:27:39.625 --> 00:27:41.425
After all this time,
you still remember me.

00:27:42.705 --> 00:27:44.905
Nie, what brings you here?

00:27:45.266 --> 00:27:46.266
Luo.

00:27:48.826 --> 00:27:50.385
Nine Oxen.

00:27:51.026 --> 00:27:52.001
They know each other?

00:27:52.001 --> 00:27:52.385
No idea.

00:27:52.385 --> 00:27:53.026
Talk later.

00:27:53.026 --> 00:27:53.746
Who is she really?

00:27:54.826 --> 00:27:56.905
Shan Qiang, South Mountain's best.

00:27:57.066 --> 00:27:59.625
Big Head got guarding down.

00:27:59.945 --> 00:28:01.546
You still remember the lame rhyme?

00:28:02.266 --> 00:28:03.506
It really is you.

00:28:03.705 --> 00:28:04.945
Coming home for New Year?

00:28:11.865 --> 00:28:13.066
Those who know me here

00:28:13.345 --> 00:28:15.185
are mostly old friends
I haven't seen in years.

00:28:15.786 --> 00:28:17.105
But for most people here,

00:28:17.105 --> 00:28:18.266
I'm a new face.

00:28:18.586 --> 00:28:19.945
Let me introduce myself.

00:28:20.345 --> 00:28:21.385
My name is Nie Jiuluo,

00:28:22.226 --> 00:28:23.226
the current Mad Blade.

00:28:26.306 --> 00:28:27.066
Mad Blade?

00:28:32.746 --> 00:28:33.746
Meeting the real deal.

00:28:41.386 --> 00:28:42.505
First my mother,

00:28:43.305 --> 00:28:44.386
then my father,

00:28:45.585 --> 00:28:46.865
and later Ling left too.

00:28:49.186 --> 00:28:50.906
That's when I decided

00:28:52.785 --> 00:28:54.426
to leave this place no matter what.

00:28:55.505 --> 00:28:56.466
Wherever to go,

00:28:58.146 --> 00:28:59.626
I just had to get away.

00:29:02.626 --> 00:29:04.265
But among all Blade Clan members,

00:29:05.265 --> 00:29:06.906
only my blood showed dominance,

00:29:07.626 --> 00:29:08.626
which means

00:29:09.545 --> 00:29:11.946
only I could inherit the Mad Blade.

00:29:13.986 --> 00:29:15.065
Jiang told me

00:29:16.545 --> 00:29:17.946
not to be so stubborn

00:29:19.345 --> 00:29:20.986
or sever South Mountain Hunters' legacy.

00:29:23.305 --> 00:29:23.986
So

00:29:24.746 --> 00:29:26.865
Baichuan secretly trained you.

00:29:27.186 --> 00:29:29.746
You passed the trials
to inherit Mad Blade

00:29:30.025 --> 00:29:31.545
and kept your identity hidden.

00:29:35.018 --> 00:29:36.458
Except Jiang and Xing Shen,

00:29:37.458 --> 00:29:38.218
no one else knew.

00:29:39.418 --> 00:29:41.139
Then why were you

00:29:41.339 --> 00:29:42.778
insisting on leaving?

00:29:44.906 --> 00:29:47.545
Because I thought until now,

00:29:48.265 --> 00:29:50.745
Earth Fiends only existed

00:29:50.745 --> 00:29:52.346
in older generations' memories

00:29:52.586 --> 00:29:53.745
and wouldn't reappear.

00:29:55.985 --> 00:29:56.906
I was naive.

00:29:58.825 --> 00:30:00.346
Excuse me, I have a question.

00:30:00.946 --> 00:30:02.106
Isn't it a tradition

00:30:02.106 --> 00:30:03.745
for the Mad Blade to remain unseen?

00:30:04.426 --> 00:30:05.225
Why did you...

00:30:08.186 --> 00:30:09.386
For now,

00:30:10.065 --> 00:30:11.305
our current understanding

00:30:11.305 --> 00:30:12.745
of humanoid Earth Fiends,

00:30:13.586 --> 00:30:16.346
every piece of intelligence
from our operations,

00:30:16.545 --> 00:30:19.866
and the progress against Earth Fiends

00:30:21.225 --> 00:30:22.305
all came from one man,

00:30:24.426 --> 00:30:25.186
Yan Tuo.

00:30:28.305 --> 00:30:29.346
Though his motives

00:30:29.346 --> 00:30:30.386
were self-serving

00:30:30.545 --> 00:30:31.946
to avenge his parents,

00:30:33.866 --> 00:30:35.146
he risked his life every time

00:30:35.146 --> 00:30:37.866
to cooperate with me

00:30:38.666 --> 00:30:39.465
and help me.

00:30:40.386 --> 00:30:41.666
Now he's missing

00:30:43.106 --> 00:30:44.785
with no way to reach him.

00:30:45.186 --> 00:30:47.866
Our past collaborations with Yan Tuo,

00:30:47.866 --> 00:30:49.946
including my personal information
and identity,

00:30:50.866 --> 00:30:52.825
may have been exposed to Lin Xirou.

00:30:54.106 --> 00:30:55.106
Given the circumstances,

00:30:56.346 --> 00:30:57.906
there's no point in secrecy anymore.

00:30:58.745 --> 00:31:01.225
So I've chosen to return
to South Mountain, reveal my identity,

00:31:02.505 --> 00:31:05.346
and stand with you all
against the enemy.

00:31:07.785 --> 00:31:10.626
Perfect. With four Earth Fiends
in our custody,

00:31:10.785 --> 00:31:12.265
we hold the strategic advantage.

00:31:13.305 --> 00:31:13.945
Xing Shen,

00:31:14.385 --> 00:31:16.425
after your negotiation with Lin Xirou,

00:31:16.626 --> 00:31:17.706
hasn't she contacted you?

00:31:24.026 --> 00:31:24.706
Luo,

00:31:27.945 --> 00:31:29.026
a word in private.

00:31:33.962 --> 00:31:37.203
I begged and pleaded with you before.

00:31:38.314 --> 00:31:39.994
Yet you insisted on leaving.

00:31:40.834 --> 00:31:43.115
And now you're exposing
your Mad Blade identity

00:31:43.994 --> 00:31:44.914
to return here,

00:31:46.155 --> 00:31:49.434
claiming to stand with us
against the enemy,

00:31:50.275 --> 00:31:51.715
but you're here to save him, right?

00:31:53.738 --> 00:31:55.858
The Hunters chose you to replace Jiang

00:31:56.658 --> 00:31:57.858
because they trusted you,

00:31:58.497 --> 00:31:59.937
deeming you worthy of leadership.

00:32:00.898 --> 00:32:02.417
But they never imagined

00:32:03.626 --> 00:32:05.107
you'd treat the innocent civilians

00:32:05.467 --> 00:32:06.746
who helped us

00:32:08.306 --> 00:32:10.587
as disposable pawns.

00:32:11.706 --> 00:32:13.226
He was raised in a fiend den.

00:32:13.826 --> 00:32:15.947
Do you truly believe he's innocent?

00:32:16.826 --> 00:32:18.467
If his sole purpose is revenge,

00:32:18.987 --> 00:32:20.226
our fight against Earth Fiends

00:32:20.226 --> 00:32:21.626
plays right into his hands.

00:32:22.467 --> 00:32:24.107
As for casualties along the way,

00:32:24.226 --> 00:32:26.907
whether Jiang or other hunters
live or die,

00:32:27.226 --> 00:32:28.746
he couldn't care less.

00:32:28.867 --> 00:32:30.306
So you deliberately betrayed him?

00:32:30.507 --> 00:32:31.266
And the outcome?

00:32:31.746 --> 00:32:33.666
Did Lin Xirou agree
to your exchange terms?

00:32:34.186 --> 00:32:35.266
Was Jiang rescued?

00:32:36.067 --> 00:32:37.626
Can we all celebrate the New Year?

00:32:38.986 --> 00:32:40.106
If you're shouting,

00:32:41.387 --> 00:32:42.666
why speak privately?

00:32:43.387 --> 00:32:45.227
Just say everything in the room.

00:32:53.227 --> 00:32:56.106
Many bird species form mixed flocks.

00:32:56.867 --> 00:32:58.227
Though living together,

00:32:59.146 --> 00:33:01.747
they prioritize their own kind.

00:33:03.706 --> 00:33:05.146
Yet despite differing goals,

00:33:05.586 --> 00:33:07.146
they cooperate in hunting

00:33:07.706 --> 00:33:08.907
and fending off predators.

00:33:12.186 --> 00:33:13.227
For years,

00:33:14.546 --> 00:33:17.827
Mad Dog, Mad Blade, and Ghost Whip

00:33:18.427 --> 00:33:19.867
have gathered for the first time.

00:33:22.227 --> 00:33:24.427
If we only squabble and quarrel,

00:33:24.427 --> 00:33:26.626
then the South Mountain Hunters

00:33:27.747 --> 00:33:29.387
stand no chance of victory.

00:33:32.347 --> 00:33:33.106
True.

00:33:34.106 --> 00:33:37.026
Goals may differ,
but it can be the same path.

00:33:38.506 --> 00:33:40.787
Someone must chart that path first.

00:33:42.146 --> 00:33:44.706
South Mountain Hunters
only follow one path.

00:33:47.146 --> 00:33:50.026
To rescue Jiang or Yan Tuo,

00:33:50.307 --> 00:33:52.146
it requires confronting Lin Xirou.

00:34:03.146 --> 00:34:04.347
My father said for millennia

00:34:04.347 --> 00:34:06.026
Mad Blades never revealed themselves.

00:34:06.146 --> 00:34:07.586
Did he mention

00:34:07.747 --> 00:34:08.706
that for millennia,

00:34:08.747 --> 00:34:10.427
Earth Fiends never took human form?

00:34:19.666 --> 00:34:21.427
Though Lin Xirou hasn't responded

00:34:21.427 --> 00:34:22.947
to our hostage exchange terms,

00:34:23.227 --> 00:34:24.867
we can't wait any longer.

00:34:25.026 --> 00:34:26.227
We must keep attacking.

00:34:26.747 --> 00:34:29.267
Mad Blade took away
Lin Xirou's blood bag,

00:34:29.267 --> 00:34:30.026
Lin Ling.

00:34:30.387 --> 00:34:32.467
She's crucial to Lin Xirou,

00:34:32.867 --> 00:34:34.467
who'll search desperately for her.

00:34:35.066 --> 00:34:36.907
Luo will try persuading Lin Ling

00:34:36.907 --> 00:34:37.907
to relocate to our base.

00:34:38.227 --> 00:34:38.747
This way,

00:34:38.747 --> 00:34:40.307
we can better protect her.

00:34:41.106 --> 00:34:41.827
Yu Rong,

00:34:41.986 --> 00:34:43.867
interrogate
those five Earth Fiends again.

00:34:44.066 --> 00:34:46.186
See if they'll reveal more intel.

00:34:47.227 --> 00:34:48.146
Big Head, Shan Qiang,

00:34:48.307 --> 00:34:50.827
use the rescue team's
resources and network

00:34:51.106 --> 00:34:52.347
for a comprehensive search.

00:34:52.986 --> 00:34:54.747
All information
related to Roadsound Group

00:34:54.747 --> 00:34:55.666
must be looked at.

00:34:56.186 --> 00:34:57.106
Especially

00:34:57.986 --> 00:35:00.427
potential locations
where Yan Tuo might be hidden.

00:35:00.626 --> 00:35:01.666
Once located,

00:35:02.546 --> 00:35:03.827
immediately launch a rescue.

00:35:04.787 --> 00:35:05.787
My apologies, everyone.

00:35:06.227 --> 00:35:07.026
We probably

00:35:08.546 --> 00:35:10.186
won't have a peaceful New Year.

00:35:46.626 --> 00:35:47.427
Luo.

00:35:49.787 --> 00:35:50.986
Happy New Year.

00:35:51.666 --> 00:35:52.227
Candy.

00:36:00.947 --> 00:36:03.066
When I left, I promised you

00:36:03.666 --> 00:36:05.267
I'd visit you regularly.

00:36:07.947 --> 00:36:08.787
Sorry about that.

00:36:11.658 --> 00:36:12.818
You're back now.

00:36:17.098 --> 00:36:20.138
Blades and hounds
walk the Turquoise Land,

00:36:21.017 --> 00:36:23.698
and Ghost Whip cracks his glowing whip.

00:36:26.017 --> 00:36:27.818
Seven hounds, two whips, and one blade.

00:36:28.017 --> 00:36:29.785
The Golden Gate
is fortified beyond defeat.

00:36:31.258 --> 00:36:33.377
A patrol checks
the Golden Gate every fourth year.

00:36:33.977 --> 00:36:35.977
No more wrongful deaths in Nanba.

00:36:37.258 --> 00:36:39.298
Wraiths and fiends walk separate paths.

00:36:40.658 --> 00:36:42.577
South Mountain Hunters risk brief lives.

00:36:44.897 --> 00:36:46.818
Blades and hounds
walk the Turquoise Land,

00:36:48.298 --> 00:36:50.577
and Ghost Whip cracks his glowing whip.

00:36:50.577 --> 00:36:52.738
Seven hounds, two whips, and one blade.

00:36:53.577 --> 00:36:55.818
No more wrongful deaths in Nanba.

00:36:57.778 --> 00:36:58.738
Be careful.

00:37:05.913 --> 00:37:08.017
Mad Dog leads the charge,
Mad Blade stays in command,

00:37:08.017 --> 00:37:09.897
Once entering the Twilight Chasm,
fiends hunt human monsters.

00:37:09.897 --> 00:37:11.217
Blades and hounds
walk the Turquoise Land,

00:37:11.217 --> 00:37:12.617
and Ghost Whip cracks his glowing whip.

00:37:12.617 --> 00:37:14.017
Seven hounds, two whips, and one blade.

00:37:14.017 --> 00:37:15.417
The Golden Gate
is fortified beyond defeat.

00:37:15.417 --> 00:37:17.217
A patrol checks
the Golden Gate every fourth year.

00:37:17.217 --> 00:37:18.737
No more wrongful deaths in Nanba.

00:37:18.737 --> 00:37:20.337
Wraiths and fiends walk separate paths.

00:37:20.337 --> 00:37:21.697
South Mountain Hunters risk brief lives.

00:37:21.697 --> 00:37:23.609
Mad Dog leads the charge,
Mad Blade stays in command,

00:37:24.297 --> 00:37:26.217
Once entering the Twilight Chasm,

00:37:28.297 --> 00:37:29.057
Ma,

00:37:32.017 --> 00:37:33.737
