00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:56.020
Ms. Bai.

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:57.100
Let's talk.

00:00:58.539 --> 00:00:59.060
Okay.

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.019
No one's around now.

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.420
Should I call you Ms. Bai

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:09.700
or Ms. Lin?

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:17.620
Don't ask such childish questions.

00:01:19.019 --> 00:01:20.980
Cheng Nuo just orders me around

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:22.739
without giving me any reasons.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.900
Today, Ye Dong took me
to see Lin Xia's body.

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.500
But the strange thing is

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:29.359
that the face was Lin Xia's,

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.299
but the body belonged to someone else.

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:34.299
Cheng Nuo is a top-tier plastic surgeon.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.379
Clearly, this was his handiwork.

00:01:37.739 --> 00:01:38.980
I'm curious

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:41.659
whose body lies

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.540
beneath your face.

00:01:46.099 --> 00:01:47.019
Guess.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.459
You don't need
to be so hostile toward me.

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:53.939
Mu Feng has leverage over me.

00:01:54.379 --> 00:01:55.780
I have to obey him.

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.459
(What leverage could
Cheng Nuo have over her)

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.459
(that would make me
fully trust this materialistic woman?)

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:04.700
I obviously know

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:06.060
that leverage

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:08.620
poses a deadly threat to you.

00:02:08.939 --> 00:02:10.860
I was coerced by Mu Feng.

00:02:12.419 --> 00:02:13.620
But you did it.

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:15.780
Now, you must pay the price.

00:02:16.219 --> 00:02:17.419
Pay the price?

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.259
I'm a victim, too!

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:20.580
If I hadn't killed her,

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:21.819
Mu Feng would've killed me!

00:02:22.139 --> 00:02:23.259
What choice did I have?

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.060
(The woman she mentioned)

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:27.879
(was Na.)

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:29.699
(She killed Na.)

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:33.219
You're innocent?

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.800
Then what about Lin Na?

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:41.300
Even if I hadn't killed her,

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:42.979
she'd still have been killed.

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:44.840
In that situation,

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:46.500
you'd make the same choice.

00:02:54.939 --> 00:02:55.819
So

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.340
it was really you who killed Na?

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.159
Is wanting to live a crime?

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:05.939
Get out.

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.900
Get out!

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.979
I'm helping you

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:18.060
not just because I'm forced.

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.000
I want to atone for my mistakes.

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:33.300
I'm sorry.

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:36.900
I'm sorry.

00:03:37.219 --> 00:03:37.819
Na.

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:41.699
I'm the one who dragged you into this.

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:44.659
I'm the one who got you killed.

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:49.120
But don't worry.

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:53.159
These scumbags

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:55.419
won't escape justice.

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:58.219
Not

00:03:59.219 --> 00:04:00.620
a single one.

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.620
I forbid you to marry
that barbaric woman.

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:10.379
Sowing wild oats

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:11.819
will bring divine retribution.

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.579
I'm the one spending my life with her,

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:18.060
not you.

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:19.339
I'm your mother.

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:21.779
I must take responsibility for you.

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:25.579
Take responsibility for me?

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:28.980
I don't need it.

00:04:30.019 --> 00:04:30.699
What?

00:04:31.939 --> 00:04:33.060
Say that again.

00:04:33.459 --> 00:04:34.500
All these years,

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:36.980
I've had enough.

00:04:38.019 --> 00:04:39.779
Can't you stop pressuring me?

00:04:44.579 --> 00:04:45.399
I gave birth to you.

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:47.480
I gave you life.

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.819
I helped you steal
someone's privileged destiny.

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.319
You'll obey me your whole life.

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:55.139
If you marry,

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:57.500
it can only be Wei.

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:59.180
Impossible.

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:06.019
Abandon that delusion.

00:05:07.459 --> 00:05:08.300
Tomorrow,

00:05:09.459 --> 00:05:11.519
I'll have someone send you back home.

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:13.339
You unfilial son.

00:05:13.779 --> 00:05:15.579
Do you need another beating?

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:21.579
Since childhood,

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:24.300
you've pressured me every second,

00:05:24.899 --> 00:05:27.019
forcing me to do things against my will.

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:29.420
Whenever I disobeyed,

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:31.180
you hit me

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:32.939
and cursed at me.

00:05:33.939 --> 00:05:36.220
You've never cared about my feelings!

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:38.139
You beast!

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:38.779
You...

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:40.819
You're not my mother at all.

00:05:41.819 --> 00:05:43.300
You're a devil!

00:05:47.819 --> 00:05:48.959
Let go of me!

00:05:48.959 --> 00:05:49.699
Do you know

00:05:50.839 --> 00:05:52.259
who I despise

00:05:53.379 --> 00:05:55.220
and loathe the most?

00:05:56.939 --> 00:05:58.540
It's you.

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:12.540
No one will ever control me again.

00:06:13.819 --> 00:06:15.259
Especially you.

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:19.180
Did you hear?

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:21.779
Tell me!

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:24.019
Did you hear me?

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:32.660
Mom,

00:06:33.259 --> 00:06:34.220
I didn't mean to.

00:06:43.819 --> 00:06:44.540
Do you think

00:06:45.899 --> 00:06:46.339
I...

00:06:46.819 --> 00:06:48.540
I did that on purpose?

00:06:49.339 --> 00:06:49.939
Mr. Ye,

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:51.100
I'll call an ambulance.

00:06:59.339 --> 00:07:00.699
My mother's getting old.

00:07:01.819 --> 00:07:03.259
She deserves to rest.

00:07:04.139 --> 00:07:04.779
Mr. Ye,

00:07:04.899 --> 00:07:06.139
call an ambulance now,

00:07:06.139 --> 00:07:07.459
or she will die!

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:12.220
I almost forgot.

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:15.100
You're so close to my mother.

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:18.720
You should accompany her.

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:23.339
Let go of me!

00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:02.820
Now that we're married,

00:09:03.419 --> 00:09:05.259
you belong to me completely.

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:16.620
Dong,

00:10:17.179 --> 00:10:17.940
what's wrong?

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:19.179
Dong,

00:10:19.659 --> 00:10:21.519
do you want another beating?

00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:38.740
Wretch.

00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:40.440
Shameless woman!

00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:42.340
I'll kill you all!

00:10:42.539 --> 00:10:43.059
I...

00:10:43.559 --> 00:10:44.700
I'll kill you all!

00:10:46.019 --> 00:10:47.220
Kill you!

00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:49.720
You've all betrayed me.

00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:51.340
Go die!

00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:55.399
Die!

00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:56.500
Die!

00:11:01.019 --> 00:11:01.860
Professor Lei,

00:11:02.179 --> 00:11:02.639
what is

00:11:02.759 --> 00:11:03.779
going on with me?

00:11:04.379 --> 00:11:05.220
Mr. Ye,

00:11:05.659 --> 00:11:07.460
according to this report,

00:11:07.659 --> 00:11:09.700
you have a severe manic disorder.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.220
Moreover,

00:11:11.299 --> 00:11:12.299
we detected hallucinogens

00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:13.779
in your body.

00:11:14.059 --> 00:11:16.360
This exacerbates your manic symptoms.

00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:17.940
Also,

00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:19.659
do you often involuntarily

00:11:19.659 --> 00:11:21.100
experience

00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:23.580
euphoric or terrifying visions?

00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:26.580
Hallucinogens?

00:11:28.139 --> 00:11:29.580
How could there be hallucinogens?

00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:32.679
Then you should reconsider

00:11:32.679 --> 00:11:34.379
your living environment.
