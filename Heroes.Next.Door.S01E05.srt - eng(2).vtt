HEROES NEXT DOOR

00:00:42.147 --> 00:00:43.106
THIS DRAMA IS A WORK OF FICTION.
ALL CHARACTERS, PROFESSIONS, PLACES,

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:44.149
COMPANIES, ORGANIZATIONS,
ETHNIC GROUPS AND EVENTS ARE NOT REAL.

00:00:44.232 --> 00:00:45.067
ALL CHILD AND ANIMAL SCENES WERE FILMED
SAFELY UNDER EXPERT SUPERVISION.

00:01:30.028 --> 00:01:32.155
Watcher-One. The site is clear.

00:01:32.656 --> 00:01:33.991
The kids are heading to the ground floor.

00:01:34.074 --> 00:01:35.701
Check the outside.

00:01:49.381 --> 00:01:51.883
Sierra-Kilo. The outside is clear.

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:53.677
The kids have arrived on the ground floor.

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.220
The man with the backpack is on the move.

00:02:14.156 --> 00:02:15.824
Sierra-Kilo!

00:02:15.907 --> 00:02:18.910
An explosion on the ground floor!
A warning for a second explosion.

00:02:18.994 --> 00:02:21.121
Retreat to B-4. Over!

00:03:20.514 --> 00:03:22.349
What's wrong, honey?
Do you have a headache?

00:03:22.557 --> 00:03:25.018
What? Oh, it's nothing. I'm fine.

00:03:26.103 --> 00:03:28.230
Dad, look!

00:03:31.108 --> 00:03:32.734
Stand beside Mom.
I'll take a photo of you two.

00:03:33.485 --> 00:03:34.820
Let's take a photo.

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:36.280
All right.

00:03:36.363 --> 00:03:38.198
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

00:03:41.576 --> 00:03:42.744
Look, Do-yeon!

00:03:57.259 --> 00:04:01.638
WE'RE FAMILY, AREN'T WE?

00:04:01.722 --> 00:04:05.434
MAGNIFYING MEDIA

00:04:14.651 --> 00:04:15.861
Producer Kim?

00:04:17.946 --> 00:04:19.156
Producer Kim.

00:04:27.122 --> 00:04:30.042
The phone is turned off.
Please leave a voice message.

00:04:30.125 --> 00:04:31.835
You will be charged extra after...

00:04:34.004 --> 00:04:35.297
The phone is turned off.

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:36.923
This afternoon,

00:04:37.007 --> 00:04:41.011
the culprit behind the online bomb threat
in Kiyun-si was arrested.

00:04:41.094 --> 00:04:42.763
The bombs were found to be fake.

00:04:42.846 --> 00:04:46.975
The suspect stated
he had planned the crime

00:04:47.059 --> 00:04:50.062
after seeing online news
questioning recent explosions in Kiyun-si.

00:04:57.027 --> 00:04:58.070
Who are they?

00:04:58.528 --> 00:04:59.529
What do you mean?

00:04:59.613 --> 00:05:02.658
Who are these bastards
playing with bombs in our neighborhood?

00:05:03.408 --> 00:05:05.035
How should I know?

00:05:05.118 --> 00:05:06.995
Isn't that what you meet up
to talk about every day?

00:05:07.704 --> 00:05:08.789
Give me a sec.

00:05:08.872 --> 00:05:10.457
PARK JEONG-HWAN

00:05:11.041 --> 00:05:12.250
Hello?

00:05:14.044 --> 00:05:15.879
What? Producer Kim is missing?

00:05:35.565 --> 00:05:39.611
MIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENT ARRESTED
FOR FAKE BOMB THREATS IN KIYUN-SI

00:05:43.073 --> 00:05:44.950
KWAK BYEONG-NAM

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:49.663
Hey, little bro.

00:05:49.746 --> 00:05:50.872
Emergency!

00:05:51.164 --> 00:05:53.500
- The fake bomb?
- No, that's not it!

00:05:53.583 --> 00:05:54.543
What is it, then?

00:05:59.298 --> 00:06:00.424
Let me call you back.

00:06:08.682 --> 00:06:09.808
Choi Kang?

00:06:11.184 --> 00:06:13.228
- Who are you?
- Let's meet.

00:06:13.854 --> 00:06:15.022
I'm asking who you are.

00:06:16.481 --> 00:06:18.400
The Chief of JDD Headquarters.

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:28.035
The Vice Minister of National Defense.
Lee Geun-cheol.

00:06:48.555 --> 00:06:50.849
What's going on? Where's Producer Kim?

00:06:50.932 --> 00:06:52.643
No idea. We can't get in touch with him.

00:06:52.726 --> 00:06:56.855
He wasn't answering when I called
about the hate comments on his video.

00:06:56.939 --> 00:06:58.315
So I came to check and...

00:06:58.398 --> 00:07:00.400
And the place was a mess.

00:07:00.484 --> 00:07:03.528
Yes, someone took the security cameras
and the hard drives, too.

00:07:04.696 --> 00:07:06.365
I didn't expect you here, Ms. Jung.

00:07:06.448 --> 00:07:08.408
What? I can't be here?

00:07:09.242 --> 00:07:10.494
Of course you can.

00:07:15.457 --> 00:07:17.542
MIN-SEO WAS AT THE FAKE BOMB SITE

00:07:18.961 --> 00:07:21.380
Hurry and help us clean up.

00:07:30.639 --> 00:07:31.682
Soldiers?

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:33.183
Huh?

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:35.310
This is a combat boot footprint.

00:07:35.727 --> 00:07:36.853
Of military officers, too.

00:07:37.896 --> 00:07:40.649
Here, I'll take a photo for evidence.

00:07:42.567 --> 00:07:44.861
You installed those things
to find Hui-ja before, right?

00:07:44.945 --> 00:07:46.280
Yeah, I did.

00:07:46.363 --> 00:07:48.657
I was just thinking about those, too!
You really know your stuff.

00:07:49.574 --> 00:07:50.659
Install what?

00:07:51.285 --> 00:07:52.369
Security cameras.

00:07:52.452 --> 00:07:53.829
There are security cameras?

00:07:53.954 --> 00:07:57.624
Hui-ja went out alone and almost got stuck
at a construction site.

00:07:57.833 --> 00:08:02.546
Chun-bae was so desperate,
so I installed a few around the town.

00:08:02.629 --> 00:08:04.965
- Why are you only telling us now?
- When was I supposed to tell you?

00:08:05.048 --> 00:08:06.466
- Where are they?
- Here and there.

00:08:07.092 --> 00:08:09.177
There are some near here, right?
Let's check those first.

00:08:09.594 --> 00:08:11.138
Yeah, let me bring them.

00:08:12.222 --> 00:08:13.140
Follow me.

00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:27.529
There we go.

00:08:29.573 --> 00:08:31.617
All this to keep
the laundry service lady safe?

00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:33.076
You're a good guy.

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:35.203
We're neighbors. We're practically family.

00:08:35.746 --> 00:08:36.997
I'd be your older brother, then.

00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:40.500
You have a real talent for being annoying.

00:08:42.252 --> 00:08:43.086
I'll take that.

00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:45.088
So what's with Ms. Jung?

00:08:45.172 --> 00:08:47.341
How did she know they were soldiers
from just footprints?

00:08:47.424 --> 00:08:49.259
She's one scary woman.

00:08:49.343 --> 00:08:51.303
She used to be a drill instructor
for the 707th Unit.

00:08:51.386 --> 00:08:52.387
What?

00:08:52.763 --> 00:08:57.059
During today's fake bomb disaster,
she went in herself to defuse the bomb.

00:08:57.142 --> 00:08:58.644
She defused a bomb by herself?

00:08:59.811 --> 00:09:01.688
Min-seo was there.

00:09:04.149 --> 00:09:05.275
Man...

00:09:06.526 --> 00:09:08.779
What's with all the special forces
in this neighborhood?

00:09:08.862 --> 00:09:10.447
Wasn't Yong-hui also in the 707th Unit?

00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:13.116
He was a military store clerk in the 707th

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:16.995
and later got assigned
to some hacking-related unit.

00:09:17.079 --> 00:09:18.997
Let's hurry before she goes off again.

00:09:29.883 --> 00:09:32.386
What are they, subduing a terrorist?

00:09:32.469 --> 00:09:34.304
Those crazy bastards.

00:09:34.388 --> 00:09:38.684
How could they arrest a journalist
in this day and age just for speaking out?

00:09:38.976 --> 00:09:41.269
It means he hit the spot.

00:09:41.353 --> 00:09:42.479
I'm checking online,

00:09:42.562 --> 00:09:44.523
and there isn't any news
about Magnifying Media.

00:09:45.023 --> 00:09:47.192
The government could be controlling it,

00:09:47.776 --> 00:09:50.320
or they could really be moving in secret.

00:09:51.071 --> 00:09:52.406
- What?
- Huh?

00:09:53.865 --> 00:09:56.535
Oh, that's just how it always is
in movies, you know?

00:09:56.618 --> 00:09:59.371
What if they arrest us, too?

00:09:59.454 --> 00:10:02.291
We were the ones who brought this
to Producer Kim's attention!

00:10:02.374 --> 00:10:04.293
He interviewed me too. Don't worry.

00:10:04.376 --> 00:10:05.961
Yeah, don't worry.
He interviewed all of us.

00:10:06.044 --> 00:10:08.380
Should we just upload this video?

00:10:09.089 --> 00:10:10.299
No, not yet.

00:10:10.382 --> 00:10:13.010
Let's check all the other videos
and find out where he was taken to.

00:10:13.427 --> 00:10:15.512
I know where all the other cameras are,

00:10:15.595 --> 00:10:18.056
so I'll check them all tonight.

00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:19.933
If I find anything,
I'll share it in the group chat.

00:10:20.017 --> 00:10:22.227
Then I'll ask this lawyer I know

00:10:22.311 --> 00:10:23.854
- what we should do with this clip.
- Okay.

00:10:23.937 --> 00:10:26.398
- I'll make some calls, too.
- Okay.

00:10:27.441 --> 00:10:28.442
And you?

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:30.736
- What are you going to do?
- Me?

00:10:31.903 --> 00:10:35.032
Hey, I installed all these cameras.
I've already done my part.

00:10:38.827 --> 00:10:40.996
I'll look around the neighborhood.

00:10:41.079 --> 00:10:43.373
If I see anyone suspicious, I'll handle...

00:10:46.209 --> 00:10:48.545
I mean... I'll scream.

00:10:50.088 --> 00:10:52.633
Yeah, he's got the voice of thunder.

00:10:53.216 --> 00:10:54.509
I'll take care of this guy.

00:10:54.593 --> 00:10:57.220
Hey, let's go patrol around.

00:10:57.304 --> 00:10:59.014
- Shall we get going, then?
- Come on.

00:11:19.284 --> 00:11:20.369
Where am I?

00:11:21.787 --> 00:11:23.830
Hold up. Hey!

00:11:24.539 --> 00:11:25.624
Hello!

00:11:26.667 --> 00:11:27.834
Hello!

00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:31.421
Hey, this is illegal confinement!

00:11:31.797 --> 00:11:34.383
Hey! Get me a lawyer right now!

00:11:34.466 --> 00:11:36.593
Hey! Hello?

00:11:36.677 --> 00:11:38.595
Somebody tell me what's going on!

00:11:38.679 --> 00:11:40.180
Where am I?

00:11:52.693 --> 00:11:57.364
Who parked their car like this?

00:11:57.447 --> 00:12:01.159
They're ruining my morning.

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:04.788
Honey, I'll need to go back and forth
a few times.

00:12:04.871 --> 00:12:05.998
Should I do it?

00:12:06.081 --> 00:12:07.499
That'll take forever.

00:12:07.582 --> 00:12:09.001
You can go and open the store.

00:12:09.084 --> 00:12:10.002
Min-seo, hop in.

00:12:10.085 --> 00:12:11.962
Just give me money. I'll take a cab.

00:12:12.754 --> 00:12:13.630
Just get in.

00:12:35.569 --> 00:12:36.612
- See you.
- Bye.

00:12:36.695 --> 00:12:37.779
Have a good day, Min-seo.

00:12:37.863 --> 00:12:40.073
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye!

00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:46.955
My Nam-yeon is totally pissed.

00:12:47.456 --> 00:12:49.583
All of you are screwed today.

00:12:51.293 --> 00:12:52.294
Mom,

00:12:52.377 --> 00:12:54.546
the fake bomb guy was an eighth-grader
at Kiyun Middle School.

00:12:55.505 --> 00:12:56.882
The police arrested him at his house.

00:12:56.965 --> 00:12:57.883
No way!

00:12:58.342 --> 00:12:59.343
And you?

00:13:00.177 --> 00:13:01.470
Are you okay?

00:13:01.928 --> 00:13:02.929
About what?

00:13:05.891 --> 00:13:06.933
Never mind.

00:13:07.476 --> 00:13:09.227
I'm glad you take after me.

00:13:17.736 --> 00:13:19.780
Get off your phone and get out.

00:13:21.156 --> 00:13:22.866
I'll be late today
because of my birthday party.

00:13:24.618 --> 00:13:26.536
Thank you for the birthday money.

00:13:28.372 --> 00:13:30.248
Call me at 9 p.m. I'll pick you up.

00:13:30.332 --> 00:13:32.542
- Okay, see you.
- Bye.

00:13:34.252 --> 00:13:36.421
Mom, you were so cool yesterday.

00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:40.175
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

00:13:40.258 --> 00:13:42.344
- Happy birthday!
- Happy birthday!

00:13:42.427 --> 00:13:43.553
Thanks!

00:13:46.223 --> 00:13:47.432
Gosh.

00:13:50.394 --> 00:13:52.646
That was an eventful day.

00:14:03.865 --> 00:14:05.784
Oh? Mr. Cellphone!

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:09.413
How's your injury?

00:14:10.998 --> 00:14:12.165
Just get in the back.

00:14:12.666 --> 00:14:14.584
- You're still sulking.
- What?

00:14:19.673 --> 00:14:22.426
Oh, my. You drive so well.

00:14:23.385 --> 00:14:26.346
VICE MINISTER OF NATIONAL DEFENSE
LEE GEUN-CHEOL

00:14:33.687 --> 00:14:34.896
That's some good photoshop.

00:14:37.899 --> 00:14:42.946
Did you spot anything peculiar
during the ATM explosion?

00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:44.781
Why are you asking me?

00:14:45.324 --> 00:14:47.284
There were soldiers
to clean up every explosion site.

00:14:48.744 --> 00:14:51.705
Does it have something to do with JDD?

00:14:52.539 --> 00:14:55.709
We're looking into it,
and I don't think so.

00:14:56.168 --> 00:14:59.046
Then why did you call me
instead of continuing the search?

00:15:00.130 --> 00:15:03.425
Surely you have the power
to mess with anyone over anything.

00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:08.305
It's not that simple,
which is why I've called you.

00:15:11.099 --> 00:15:13.435
If the Vice Minister of National Defense
is having trouble,

00:15:13.518 --> 00:15:15.729
is this related
to the Minister or something?

00:15:25.781 --> 00:15:28.033
My, my. This guy.

00:15:28.909 --> 00:15:30.661
Lee Yong-hui.

00:15:31.536 --> 00:15:32.704
A manager...

00:15:33.413 --> 00:15:35.040
A manager at a special martial arts gym?

00:15:37.668 --> 00:15:40.921
Kwak Byeong-nam. Runs a stationery shop.

00:15:41.505 --> 00:15:42.839
The HID Unit?

00:15:46.510 --> 00:15:49.221
Jung Nam-yeon, Mammoseu Mart.

00:15:49.596 --> 00:15:52.891
She's the one who made a scene
about defusing the bomb herself.

00:15:55.185 --> 00:15:58.563
She was the youngest drill instructor
of the 707th Unit?

00:15:59.731 --> 00:16:01.108
CERTIFIED COUNTER-TERRORISM EOD INSTRUCTOR

00:16:04.653 --> 00:16:06.154
A Hanguk University student?

00:16:07.656 --> 00:16:08.824
A mortar?

00:16:09.074 --> 00:16:10.951
What kind of a neighborhood is this?

00:16:13.996 --> 00:16:16.581
This guy was exempt from conscription.

00:16:17.082 --> 00:16:18.417
Nothing special.

00:16:20.669 --> 00:16:22.337
So, why did you call me?

00:16:23.088 --> 00:16:24.923
The bombs that went off in Kiyun-si

00:16:25.299 --> 00:16:28.969
were used in the Korean military
a few years back.

00:16:29.970 --> 00:16:32.347
We don't know
how they ended up in Kiyun-si yet.

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:38.812
So that's why the soldiers
were in such a hurry to clean up the site.

00:16:39.771 --> 00:16:42.482
But what was a foreigner doing with it?

00:16:42.899 --> 00:16:45.986
It was definitely a foreigner
who had the bomb at the ATM.

00:16:47.362 --> 00:16:49.740
That's what's odd,
which is why we're investigating it.

00:16:50.157 --> 00:16:51.408
If you could just help us--

00:16:51.491 --> 00:16:54.911
Oh, no, I'm just a civilian now.

00:16:55.996 --> 00:16:58.373
This isn't a mission.
I'm asking you a favor.

00:17:00.083 --> 00:17:02.169
Let me ask you one, too.

00:17:02.711 --> 00:17:05.505
Please stop calling me.

00:17:08.425 --> 00:17:11.845
Something's going on,
and Kiyun-si is at the center of it.

00:17:13.639 --> 00:17:16.391
That's something even
my six-year-old daughter knows.

00:17:16.475 --> 00:17:18.143
Talk about stating the obvious.

00:17:18.226 --> 00:17:21.146
We'd really appreciate your help,
Mr. Choi.

00:17:34.409 --> 00:17:36.620
Where am I?

00:17:37.746 --> 00:17:38.622
Hey!

00:17:46.004 --> 00:17:49.299
Taxi...

00:17:52.803 --> 00:17:54.304
TO VEOTIGO INSURANCE: 58,000 WON

00:17:56.181 --> 00:17:57.933
It costs 58,000 won?

00:18:04.231 --> 00:18:07.818
That man sure knows how to hold a grudge!

00:18:08.235 --> 00:18:09.486
Man!

00:18:11.029 --> 00:18:14.616
The next news is about
Kiyun-si's specialized IT zone plan.

00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:16.743
James Sullivan's representative
announced a change coming...

00:18:16.827 --> 00:18:18.829
- Sir, please turn up the volume.
- Sure.

00:18:18.912 --> 00:18:21.581
...including that for Kiyun-si.

00:18:21.748 --> 00:18:25.210
Sullivan's Joinus Company
has even purchased the land

00:18:25.294 --> 00:18:27.587
to build its Asian hub,

00:18:27.671 --> 00:18:30.048
yet it's announced a change
in its investment plans...

00:18:30.132 --> 00:18:33.969
Too bad for anyone who recently
bought property in Kiyun-si for this.

00:18:35.721 --> 00:18:37.139
That'd be me.

00:18:37.222 --> 00:18:38.932
...causing a rise in anxiety.

00:18:39.016 --> 00:18:41.810
In fact, no transactions were made
on properties in Kiyun-si today,

00:18:41.893 --> 00:18:45.147
reflecting people's quick reaction
to Sullivan's announcement.

00:18:45.647 --> 00:18:48.859
In response to this, Kiyun-si announced...

00:18:48.942 --> 00:18:50.485
Only under two conditions.

00:18:51.987 --> 00:18:53.030
First,

00:18:54.031 --> 00:18:56.074
you know that Producer Kim In-seop
of Magnifying Media

00:18:56.158 --> 00:18:57.951
was arrested by soldiers yesterday, right?

00:18:59.411 --> 00:19:02.164
The license plate number was H60 6789.

00:19:09.463 --> 00:19:11.381
Don't tell me you didn't know about this.

00:19:14.885 --> 00:19:18.513
They arrested a civilian journalist
without the Vice Minister's knowledge?

00:19:20.349 --> 00:19:21.808
I'll look into it as soon as possible.

00:19:22.684 --> 00:19:23.935
What's the second condition?

00:19:25.312 --> 00:19:27.981
To wipe out every record
regarding my past.

00:19:30.859 --> 00:19:32.819
If you can promise those two things,

00:19:33.737 --> 00:19:36.198
I'll consider it.

00:19:44.456 --> 00:19:46.667
I checked wherever I could, too.

00:19:47.417 --> 00:19:48.251
Yeah.

00:19:52.005 --> 00:19:53.298
You have no idea, either?

00:19:54.549 --> 00:19:57.427
They arrested a civilian,
and nobody knows where he went.

00:19:57.511 --> 00:19:59.304
He's not on the news, either. Gosh.

00:20:01.556 --> 00:20:03.266
Anyway, okay, then.

00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:04.935
Thanks, bye.

00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:19.866
I really don't want to ask her
for a favor.

00:20:22.619 --> 00:20:23.453
Ms. Na,

00:20:24.288 --> 00:20:27.040
you got a call from the head of
the Women's Association in Changri-dong.

00:20:27.124 --> 00:20:28.875
Who? The Women's Association?

00:20:28.959 --> 00:20:29.918
Oh, Nam-yeon?

00:20:30.377 --> 00:20:31.753
Why would she call me?

00:20:31.837 --> 00:20:33.797
She said she had a favor to ask you.

00:20:34.756 --> 00:20:35.882
Is that so?

00:20:37.259 --> 00:20:38.719
Guess she needs something.

00:20:39.636 --> 00:20:40.470
What's that?

00:20:40.554 --> 00:20:43.348
The bomb analysis you asked for
from the Kiyun-si explosions.

00:20:56.278 --> 00:21:01.325
MINISTRY OF NATIONAL DEFENSE

00:21:09.207 --> 00:21:12.419
Oh, man.

00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:25.432
NA EUN-JAE

00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:33.482
Hello. To what do I owe the pleasure?

00:21:33.565 --> 00:21:37.235
I wondered why you were rushing
to blame them on butane gas,

00:21:37.319 --> 00:21:39.029
but you've been
really doing your job, huh?

00:21:39.237 --> 00:21:41.615
What's this absolute nonsense?

00:21:42.658 --> 00:21:44.993
"HMX found."

00:21:45.953 --> 00:21:48.497
"A unique trait of C-4s
produced in Korea."

00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:51.333
"A unique recipe,

00:21:51.416 --> 00:21:53.710
only used at Korea's domestic
munitions factories."

00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:56.713
Want me to read you the whole thing?

00:21:57.923 --> 00:22:01.218
"Same boat," my foot.
Why did you go behind my back?

00:22:01.677 --> 00:22:05.681
I guess someone's been sneaking away
military supplies, huh?

00:22:06.098 --> 00:22:07.057
Ms. Na.

00:22:08.141 --> 00:22:09.434
I got this

00:22:10.268 --> 00:22:12.104
under control, all right?

00:22:12.771 --> 00:22:13.981
Just wait a bit.

00:22:14.064 --> 00:22:16.858
I don't care what you do
to get some extra money,

00:22:17.526 --> 00:22:20.821
but I won't let it slide
if this ruins the specialized zone plan.

00:22:20.904 --> 00:22:24.116
I'm telling you,
that's not going to happen!

00:22:24.199 --> 00:22:25.450
Minister Kim.

00:22:25.867 --> 00:22:27.160
Come on, Seok-jun.

00:22:27.619 --> 00:22:30.580
One wrong move, and you're done.

00:22:30.664 --> 00:22:31.790
Good luck, okay?

00:22:33.458 --> 00:22:34.543
Damn it.

00:22:35.335 --> 00:22:37.170
Why, that little...

00:22:38.130 --> 00:22:40.549
NA EUN-JAE

00:22:55.522 --> 00:22:56.565
Oh, my!

00:22:56.648 --> 00:22:59.568
My goodness. Did you come alone, Hui-ja?

00:23:00.235 --> 00:23:02.487
It's just a short walk.
Why would I need someone with me?

00:23:03.405 --> 00:23:04.489
Here.

00:23:05.365 --> 00:23:06.241
What's this?

00:23:07.868 --> 00:23:09.119
Seaweed soup?

00:23:09.536 --> 00:23:12.080
It's full of mussels, my favorite.

00:23:12.748 --> 00:23:15.834
What's the special occasion?

00:23:16.376 --> 00:23:18.128
It's Min-seo's birthday today.

00:23:18.211 --> 00:23:20.589
Did you forget
your own daughter's birthday?

00:23:21.048 --> 00:23:23.925
You remember Min-seo's birthday?

00:23:24.009 --> 00:23:25.552
You were crying your eyes out

00:23:25.636 --> 00:23:28.513
about your parents
not being near enough to help then.

00:23:28.597 --> 00:23:31.683
So I was the one
who made you seaweed soup.

00:23:31.767 --> 00:23:33.435
Why wouldn't I remember that?

00:23:35.062 --> 00:23:38.982
Oh, my, Hui-ja,
you remember everything now.

00:23:41.109 --> 00:23:42.819
Is that for your husband?

00:23:43.904 --> 00:23:45.364
No, for Myeong-o.

00:23:45.656 --> 00:23:47.866
I see. Myeong-o's mom?

00:23:48.575 --> 00:23:49.910
She came by yesterday

00:23:50.285 --> 00:23:53.747
and wouldn't stop talking about
how he got a perfect score.

00:23:54.831 --> 00:23:57.000
It's impressive
how well she's raising him by herself.

00:23:57.334 --> 00:23:59.711
Just wait and see.
He'll make it to Hanguk University.

00:24:03.674 --> 00:24:04.591
Right.

00:24:06.802 --> 00:24:09.805
I can take that to Myeong-o's mom for you.

00:24:09.888 --> 00:24:12.099
I'm seeing her later, anyway.

00:24:12.182 --> 00:24:13.934
- Will you do that for me?
- Yeah.

00:24:14.685 --> 00:24:15.727
And...

00:24:16.645 --> 00:24:17.771
Are you heading back?

00:24:17.854 --> 00:24:19.606
Let me tag along for some fresh air.

00:24:19.690 --> 00:24:21.650
You have to watch the store.
You can't leave.

00:24:21.733 --> 00:24:24.444
- It's a quick walk. Let's go.
- What?

00:24:24.528 --> 00:24:25.612
Hui-ja!

00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:28.115
Why'd you leave without telling me?

00:24:28.198 --> 00:24:29.950
I was looking for you everywhere!

00:24:30.617 --> 00:24:31.827
Why would you look for me?

00:24:35.706 --> 00:24:37.833
Because I missed you.

00:24:38.709 --> 00:24:39.584
Shall we?

00:24:40.043 --> 00:24:40.919
Okay.

00:24:41.712 --> 00:24:43.547
See you. Bye, Hui-ja.

00:24:46.049 --> 00:24:49.344
Hey, let's tell each other
where we're going

00:24:49.928 --> 00:24:51.221
before going anywhere.

00:25:03.734 --> 00:25:05.485
Hey, I'm here.

00:25:07.029 --> 00:25:09.323
I brought some side dishes for you.

00:25:10.115 --> 00:25:14.536
Hui-ja even made seaweed soup for you.

00:25:15.746 --> 00:25:17.122
Let's see.

00:25:18.749 --> 00:25:19.750
Gosh.

00:25:20.125 --> 00:25:22.044
I can tell who's dropped by

00:25:22.336 --> 00:25:25.631
just by looking at these containers.

00:25:27.090 --> 00:25:29.885
If you don't have an appetite,

00:25:30.010 --> 00:25:33.513
you should at least have some plain rice.

00:25:39.645 --> 00:25:41.188
You're kidding me.

00:25:45.525 --> 00:25:46.610
Hurry and eat.

00:25:46.944 --> 00:25:49.154
I'm not leaving until you eat it all.

00:26:09.549 --> 00:26:10.384
What?

00:26:10.968 --> 00:26:12.386
Is it too salty?

00:26:13.136 --> 00:26:14.179
Too hot?

00:26:18.266 --> 00:26:20.310
You can't.

00:26:20.394 --> 00:26:23.188
You have to eat,
even if it's just a little bit.

00:26:23.271 --> 00:26:24.731
Okay? Here.

00:26:31.947 --> 00:26:32.781
What's this?

00:26:32.864 --> 00:26:34.074
MAEUM LIFE INSURANCE
SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT

00:26:34.533 --> 00:26:36.034
The bus company brought it,

00:26:37.119 --> 00:26:39.121
asking me to sign it.

00:26:42.708 --> 00:26:44.668
I felt like

00:26:45.919 --> 00:26:48.630
once I sign that,
I'll never get to know...

00:26:50.674 --> 00:26:51.717
why...

00:26:53.552 --> 00:26:55.137
my Myeong-o died.

00:26:59.266 --> 00:27:00.434
Don't sign it.

00:27:01.310 --> 00:27:02.477
Don't do it.

00:27:02.561 --> 00:27:05.272
I can't let go
of Myeong-o like this, either.

00:27:07.274 --> 00:27:08.358
Don't sign it.

00:27:10.777 --> 00:27:12.279
Let's not do it, okay?

00:27:49.733 --> 00:27:54.154
MS. LEE, PLEASE DON'T SKIP YOUR MEALS
FROM JEONG-HWAN

00:27:56.406 --> 00:27:57.240
Come in.

00:27:57.324 --> 00:28:00.118
MINISTRY OF NATIONAL DEFENSE

00:28:05.666 --> 00:28:07.167
On the day Kim In-seop was kidnapped,

00:28:07.250 --> 00:28:09.544
the 707th Unit was out
on a counter-terrorism mission.

00:28:09.628 --> 00:28:11.213
Who was in charge of the mission?

00:28:11.296 --> 00:28:12.756
The battalion commander,

00:28:12.839 --> 00:28:15.550
but he was directly ordered
by Minister Kim.

00:28:17.302 --> 00:28:20.305
And where did they take Kim In-seop to?

00:28:20.389 --> 00:28:24.017
The thing is,
the unit returned to the base,

00:28:24.101 --> 00:28:25.560
but nobody was with them.

00:28:27.771 --> 00:28:30.107
He's using the military
like a private service.

00:28:30.190 --> 00:28:33.402
And about the vehicle, H60 6789,
that you asked me to look into.

00:28:33.902 --> 00:28:36.446
It belongs to Colonel Jang Jun-hui's unit
from the Logistic Support Group.

00:28:36.989 --> 00:28:39.241
Look into the route
that the 707th Unit took to return.

00:28:39.700 --> 00:28:43.328
They must've snuck Kim In-seop
into Jang's vehicle on the way back.

00:28:43.662 --> 00:28:45.122
Yes, sir.

00:29:01.972 --> 00:29:02.806
Sit here.

00:29:13.567 --> 00:29:14.526
This video.

00:29:15.611 --> 00:29:16.570
Where did you get it?

00:29:17.654 --> 00:29:19.448
Get me my lawyer.

00:29:19.823 --> 00:29:22.492
Let me ask you one more time.

00:29:23.327 --> 00:29:25.162
The vehicle in the accident disappeared,

00:29:25.746 --> 00:29:29.541
but we found its dashcam footage
on your computer.

00:29:30.292 --> 00:29:32.628
How did you know
that the vehicle disappeared?

00:29:33.670 --> 00:29:35.088
Did you guys take it?

00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:39.301
You uploaded an article,

00:29:39.384 --> 00:29:41.762
claiming that a bomb caused
the Kiyun Intersection accident, right?

00:29:42.346 --> 00:29:43.680
Who's behind it?

00:29:44.139 --> 00:29:45.223
A terrorist group?

00:29:46.183 --> 00:29:47.017
North Korea?

00:29:47.643 --> 00:29:48.810
A politician?

00:29:52.481 --> 00:29:55.651
What a huge stretch.

00:29:56.193 --> 00:30:00.322
So this is how you framed people
into being spies, huh?

00:30:00.656 --> 00:30:03.617
I'm a journalist,

00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:05.285
and all I did was do my job.

00:30:05.535 --> 00:30:07.454
I wasn't hired by anyone.

00:30:07.871 --> 00:30:09.665
I was just covering the news!

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:13.335
How passionate.

00:30:13.627 --> 00:30:16.755
We have plenty of time,
so let's take it slow.

00:30:23.762 --> 00:30:25.931
- Nobody's here?
- No.

00:30:26.014 --> 00:30:28.433
I think we'll find Producer Kim soon.

00:30:28.934 --> 00:30:29.810
How?

00:30:31.603 --> 00:30:33.480
I'll be getting information from JDD.

00:30:34.398 --> 00:30:36.024
- JDD?
- Oh, gosh.

00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:37.234
Why are you here?

00:30:37.317 --> 00:30:40.487
- He asked me to fix his computer.
- Yeah.

00:30:40.779 --> 00:30:43.490
Anyway, they're looking for him,
and they'll call me soon.

00:30:43.573 --> 00:30:44.950
Then I'll go and get him.

00:30:45.033 --> 00:30:47.744
- Let's go together.
- I'll go with you, too.

00:30:47.828 --> 00:30:50.038
Calm down. I'll go alone.

00:30:50.122 --> 00:30:51.873
Why? Are we embarrassing?

00:30:51.957 --> 00:30:54.501
No, it's dangerous.
I'll go alone this time.

00:30:54.584 --> 00:30:55.460
Come on...

00:31:01.383 --> 00:31:03.093
Why is nobody talking now that I'm here?

00:31:03.844 --> 00:31:05.178
We've been quiet the whole time.

00:31:05.429 --> 00:31:06.930
- Right?
- Yeah.

00:31:08.974 --> 00:31:10.475
Sorry for being late.

00:31:10.559 --> 00:31:12.394
- What took you so long?
- Why are you so late?

00:31:12.477 --> 00:31:14.980
- You have to be on time!
- That's right!

00:31:15.063 --> 00:31:17.024
You kept the grown-ups waiting.
You can't do that.

00:31:17.107 --> 00:31:18.734
- That's right.
- For goodness' sake.

00:31:18.817 --> 00:31:19.776
Sorry.

00:31:20.944 --> 00:31:21.778
It's fine.

00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:24.615
I checked the footage all night,

00:31:24.698 --> 00:31:27.034
and nothing peculiar
was caught on the cameras.

00:31:27.117 --> 00:31:28.368
Hey, go.

00:31:28.452 --> 00:31:29.578
Yes.

00:31:29.661 --> 00:31:31.913
I've spoken to a lawyer,

00:31:31.997 --> 00:31:33.707
and he says it's best
not to mess with the military.

00:31:33.790 --> 00:31:35.959
Even Officer Park patrols other towns,

00:31:36.043 --> 00:31:37.377
saying our town is safe.

00:31:37.461 --> 00:31:39.046
There haven't been any reports.

00:31:40.505 --> 00:31:44.301
I also made some calls,
but didn't find anything useful.

00:31:44.635 --> 00:31:46.303
They would have been smart.

00:31:47.638 --> 00:31:51.433
Then shouldn't we
find a way to outsmart them?

00:31:54.478 --> 00:31:55.562
Yes, we should.

00:31:56.438 --> 00:31:58.523
- Don't worry too much.
- That's right.

00:31:58.607 --> 00:32:00.275
We have Kang here...

00:32:06.114 --> 00:32:08.116
who works for an insurance company.

00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:11.411
Everyone has
proper health insurance, right?

00:32:11.495 --> 00:32:13.830
We have nothing to worry about, then.

00:32:17.626 --> 00:32:22.506
HARDWARE DREAM TREE STATIONERY

00:32:22.589 --> 00:32:24.800
Why is everyone so reckless?

00:32:24.883 --> 00:32:26.385
How can you suggest uploading the video

00:32:26.468 --> 00:32:28.345
after seeing Producer Kim get kidnapped?

00:32:28.428 --> 00:32:30.973
What if something happens
to you guys, too?

00:32:31.390 --> 00:32:33.558
What do you think, huh?

00:32:34.351 --> 00:32:37.854
Are you going to stay still
if I get kidnapped?

00:32:38.105 --> 00:32:39.106
Yes.

00:32:40.399 --> 00:32:42.317
I'd go save you, you jerk.

00:32:44.444 --> 00:32:45.570
You? Saving me?

00:32:46.154 --> 00:32:47.406
That'd never happen.

00:32:50.826 --> 00:32:51.785
Goodnight, then.

00:32:53.453 --> 00:32:54.579
Hey.

00:32:55.372 --> 00:32:56.290
Are you sulking?

00:32:59.584 --> 00:33:01.920
You are. My goodness.

00:33:10.012 --> 00:33:11.847
Make sure to drop by before work tomorrow.

00:33:46.673 --> 00:33:49.926
With this, you'll become Thor himself.

00:33:53.930 --> 00:33:56.016
Honey! Hurry up.

00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:07.945
Honey, where's Do-yeon's backpack?

00:34:08.779 --> 00:34:11.657
Is this the backpack
you're speaking of, ma'am?

00:34:13.617 --> 00:34:14.743
Yes, it is.

00:34:15.577 --> 00:34:17.329
Do-yeon, get up. Let's go.

00:34:17.412 --> 00:34:18.413
Come here.

00:34:20.832 --> 00:34:23.919
After the Supreme Court's final verdict
on Charlotte Sullivan's death,

00:34:24.002 --> 00:34:25.671
James Sullivan has announced...

00:34:25.754 --> 00:34:27.297
It's the ice cream man.

00:34:27.381 --> 00:34:28.715
What ice cream?

00:34:29.341 --> 00:34:31.927
That man gave me ice cream.

00:34:32.010 --> 00:34:35.013
The legal process
for Charlotte Sullivan's death is over,

00:34:35.097 --> 00:34:37.724
- but as for the investment,
- Goodness, Do-yeon.

00:34:37.808 --> 00:34:40.852
Sullivan is reluctant to go ahead
without rebuilding the trust.

00:34:41.478 --> 00:34:45.023
Experts see this announcement as a sign

00:34:45.107 --> 00:34:47.859
that Sullivan is pulling out
of the special IT zone development plan.

00:34:48.527 --> 00:34:49.861
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:34:49.945 --> 00:34:52.197
- Good morning.
- Your hair looks great.

00:34:52.281 --> 00:34:53.490
- Do-yeon.
- Yeah?

00:34:54.157 --> 00:34:58.829
Are you sure it was the man on TV
who gave you the ice cream?

00:34:58.912 --> 00:35:00.539
- Yes.
- Have a great day.

00:35:01.331 --> 00:35:03.375
It wasn't someone
who just looked like him?

00:35:03.458 --> 00:35:06.044
No, it was him.
He looked exactly the same.

00:35:06.128 --> 00:35:07.462
Hi.

00:35:08.338 --> 00:35:09.548
Okay, then.

00:35:11.133 --> 00:35:13.802
Did he only give you the ice cream,

00:35:13.885 --> 00:35:16.013
or did he give some to other kids, too?

00:35:16.096 --> 00:35:19.182
I don't know. He said it was from you.

00:35:20.267 --> 00:35:21.810
Is that so?

00:35:24.938 --> 00:35:26.440
It's Ms. Olivia!

00:35:38.577 --> 00:35:40.621
Dad, you're awesome at English!

00:35:41.079 --> 00:35:42.331
This is nothing.

00:35:43.248 --> 00:35:44.625
I'm heading to work. See you later.

00:35:44.708 --> 00:35:45.667
Bye!

00:35:53.550 --> 00:35:55.802
WATER CELERY HERBAL PRODUCT
HURRY UP TO GET IT!

00:36:26.875 --> 00:36:27.876
Make sure to drop by.

00:36:36.510 --> 00:36:38.387
- Hey, good morning.
- Hey.

00:36:38.637 --> 00:36:40.013
I got Producer Kim's location.

00:36:40.097 --> 00:36:41.515
I'll go get him right now.

00:36:41.598 --> 00:36:43.725
Are you sure you'll be fine alone?

00:36:47.729 --> 00:36:50.190
Take this with you.

00:36:50.565 --> 00:36:53.068
It's a miniature camera with GPS.

00:36:58.365 --> 00:36:59.491
You called me over for this?

00:37:00.617 --> 00:37:01.618
Just wait.

00:37:18.927 --> 00:37:19.928
Get in.

00:37:31.982 --> 00:37:33.442
You're here early.

00:37:34.318 --> 00:37:36.695
Yes, I've got a lot of work to do.

00:37:37.070 --> 00:37:40.032
Anything I should know about?

00:37:41.617 --> 00:37:42.451
No.

00:37:43.452 --> 00:37:45.120
Just something personal.

00:37:46.455 --> 00:37:47.372
I see.

00:37:58.634 --> 00:37:59.635
See you around.

00:37:59.718 --> 00:38:00.552
Yes, sir.

00:38:05.432 --> 00:38:06.391
Sir.

00:38:13.482 --> 00:38:17.569
What are those little rats
whispering about?

00:38:18.236 --> 00:38:20.072
MINISTRY OF NATIONAL DEFENSE

00:38:40.926 --> 00:38:41.843
Hey.

00:38:42.594 --> 00:38:44.388
Something smells fishy around here.

00:38:45.263 --> 00:38:46.348
Clean up the site.

00:38:54.314 --> 00:38:56.942
Damn it, this sucks.

00:38:57.276 --> 00:38:58.402
Man...

00:39:01.238 --> 00:39:02.656
This is total bullshit.

00:39:02.906 --> 00:39:04.116
Damn it.

00:39:05.534 --> 00:39:08.328
That crazy bastard!

00:39:13.125 --> 00:39:14.793
INSURANCE BASTARD

00:39:15.210 --> 00:39:17.504
Damn it! You've got to be kidding me!

00:39:17.587 --> 00:39:19.631
Just let me eat, okay?

00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:26.221
How are you, sir?

00:39:26.596 --> 00:39:28.932
I'm always busy working hard, you know?

00:39:29.099 --> 00:39:30.475
How are you feeling?

00:39:32.227 --> 00:39:34.896
You know, all thanks to you,

00:39:34.980 --> 00:39:36.189
I'm still in pain.

00:39:37.858 --> 00:39:41.862
Don't tell me you resent me
or want to curse me.

00:39:43.655 --> 00:39:47.034
Curse you? I hate cursing.

00:39:47.367 --> 00:39:49.494
That's why I don't even go to the
beach in the summer.

00:39:49.578 --> 00:39:50.871
Can't let the heat make me curse.

00:39:52.456 --> 00:39:54.875
I don't even go to saunas
because I don't want to curse, you know?

00:39:54.958 --> 00:39:57.586
Good, as you should.

00:39:58.378 --> 00:39:59.546
Anyway, Sang-ho,

00:39:59.838 --> 00:40:03.258
I've got a task that's very hard for me
but very easy for you.

00:40:03.342 --> 00:40:04.509
Could you help me?

00:40:04.926 --> 00:40:07.554
Feel free to say no.
I'll visit you in person, then.

00:40:07.888 --> 00:40:09.931
Oh, not at all.

00:40:10.015 --> 00:40:11.808
Of course I'll help you.

00:40:12.059 --> 00:40:13.644
Thanks, Sang-ho.

00:40:48.303 --> 00:40:49.137
Ta-da.

00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:52.683
What's this? A gun?

00:40:52.766 --> 00:40:54.810
Come on. It's a taser gun.

00:40:54.893 --> 00:40:56.311
I modified it,

00:40:56.395 --> 00:40:58.981
so it's much more powerful
than store-bought ones.

00:40:59.356 --> 00:41:01.275
It's stronger than what the police use,
so be careful.

00:41:01.358 --> 00:41:03.568
If you get hit by this, you're finished.

00:41:04.027 --> 00:41:05.028
One more thing.

00:41:06.363 --> 00:41:07.489
This is the real deal.

00:41:13.870 --> 00:41:16.707
You can shoot three times
after loading it just once,

00:41:16.790 --> 00:41:18.208
like a gun.

00:41:18.458 --> 00:41:19.459
Sick, right?

00:41:22.546 --> 00:41:24.006
You want me to guard myself with this?

00:41:24.089 --> 00:41:26.466
No, it's for the bad guys.

00:41:27.342 --> 00:41:28.593
Don't kill them.

00:41:28.677 --> 00:41:30.137
Just incapacitate them with this.

00:41:30.429 --> 00:41:31.972
You're not in JDD anymore.

00:41:32.055 --> 00:41:33.598
You have to think about your family, too.

00:41:34.349 --> 00:41:35.726
Don't cause too much trouble.

00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:10.260
Seriously...

00:42:43.877 --> 00:42:44.920
Where is he going?

00:42:45.003 --> 00:42:47.839
Hold on. Where is this?

00:42:49.883 --> 00:42:52.844
- He's not on the highway.
- No.

00:42:52.928 --> 00:42:54.012
What are you looking at?

00:43:02.312 --> 00:43:04.106
Just my phone, why?

00:43:04.439 --> 00:43:05.691
Yeah, I know.

00:43:05.774 --> 00:43:07.067
What are you looking at?

00:43:07.442 --> 00:43:10.570
Just a bunch of things.
Some reels, you know?

00:43:12.322 --> 00:43:13.448
Why are you here?

00:43:13.740 --> 00:43:15.200
Me?

00:43:15.284 --> 00:43:16.243
I called him here.

00:43:16.326 --> 00:43:19.496
I needed him to reinstall
the cameras from yesterday.

00:43:19.579 --> 00:43:21.832
Yeah, I'm here to pick them up.

00:43:24.501 --> 00:43:25.877
You know what I think?

00:43:27.004 --> 00:43:28.547
You two

00:43:28.630 --> 00:43:32.634
and Mr. Choi are up to something.

00:43:40.475 --> 00:43:41.601
Are you on your way?

00:43:42.811 --> 00:43:45.105
I'll be back after I drive Min-seo home.

00:43:45.439 --> 00:43:46.857
Wait right here.

00:43:46.940 --> 00:43:47.816
Yes, ma'am.

00:43:55.449 --> 00:43:58.160
Man, what do we do now? She's so scary.

00:43:58.243 --> 00:44:00.495
Why are you so scared?

00:44:00.579 --> 00:44:02.581
Just go and reinstall the cameras.

00:44:02.664 --> 00:44:03.707
A perfect alibi.

00:44:06.501 --> 00:44:07.711
Get going, will you?

00:44:07.794 --> 00:44:09.463
She told us to wait here!

00:44:09.546 --> 00:44:10.756
Oh, right.

00:44:17.596 --> 00:44:19.139
All right. Look at this.

00:44:20.057 --> 00:44:20.891
Right here.

00:44:52.798 --> 00:44:53.840
Hey, honey.

00:44:54.216 --> 00:44:55.634
Can you take a cab and pick up Min-seo?

00:44:55.717 --> 00:44:57.094
I have something to do.

00:44:57.844 --> 00:44:58.679
Okay.

00:45:39.803 --> 00:45:41.847
MAGNIFYING MEDIA

00:46:08.665 --> 00:46:09.541
Ms. Jung!

00:46:16.923 --> 00:46:17.758
Are you okay?

00:46:17.841 --> 00:46:19.092
Yeah, go after him.

00:46:44.368 --> 00:46:45.369
Yes?

00:46:46.078 --> 00:46:47.037
We failed

00:46:48.080 --> 00:46:49.289
to clean up the site.

00:46:53.627 --> 00:46:56.505
You piece of trash, you had one job!

00:47:01.969 --> 00:47:02.928
Hey.

00:47:04.179 --> 00:47:06.515
Get rid of Kim In-seop.

00:47:08.558 --> 00:47:10.102
Get rid of him. Get...

00:47:11.353 --> 00:47:13.230
Kill him, you moron.

00:47:13.313 --> 00:47:15.774
Yes, for real, you idiot!

00:47:16.733 --> 00:47:19.319
You better not leave any traces,
all right?

00:47:20.445 --> 00:47:21.571
Don't mess this up.

00:49:24.903 --> 00:49:27.823
Wow, I didn't think it'd actually work!

00:49:42.462 --> 00:49:43.422
Drag him out.

00:49:44.089 --> 00:49:46.550
Wait. Where are we going?

00:49:46.633 --> 00:49:48.343
Where are you taking me?

00:49:48.427 --> 00:49:49.803
Hey, where are you taking me?

00:49:50.470 --> 00:49:51.555
Where are you taking me?

00:49:51.888 --> 00:49:53.557
Just tell me where we're going.

00:49:53.640 --> 00:49:55.642
Why won't you tell me?

00:50:05.694 --> 00:50:07.029
Fine.

00:50:07.112 --> 00:50:08.322
I get it!

00:50:08.405 --> 00:50:10.616
Hey, do you know how wrong this is?

00:50:23.045 --> 00:50:24.254
Where is this?

00:50:25.339 --> 00:50:27.049
Where the hell is this?

00:50:28.133 --> 00:50:28.967
Quiet.

00:51:18.725 --> 00:51:20.769
No! Please, no!

00:51:20.852 --> 00:51:23.355
Producer Kim, it's me.

00:51:28.610 --> 00:51:29.945
Mr. Choi...

00:51:33.407 --> 00:51:35.784
Mr. Choi...

00:51:37.411 --> 00:51:38.495
I got him out.

00:51:39.955 --> 00:51:41.915
I'll send you the coordinates. Head there.

00:51:42.708 --> 00:51:44.710
That's the safest place for now.

00:51:45.836 --> 00:51:46.670
Understood.

00:51:47.546 --> 00:51:48.505
Okay.

00:51:53.677 --> 00:51:55.304
No one's following us.

00:51:56.513 --> 00:51:59.057
Won't they find us
once they run the license plate?

00:51:59.641 --> 00:52:01.268
It's okay. This isn't my car.

00:52:02.185 --> 00:52:03.353
Are you hurt anywhere?

00:52:07.316 --> 00:52:08.317
No.

00:52:10.402 --> 00:52:11.862
Where were we, by the way?

00:52:12.946 --> 00:52:16.491
Seemed like an abandoned
military intelligence facility.

00:52:17.242 --> 00:52:18.243
I see.

00:52:23.457 --> 00:52:25.208
Who are you, really?

00:52:26.084 --> 00:52:28.128
- Me?
- Yes.

00:52:28.211 --> 00:52:29.463
Didn't I tell you?

00:52:29.546 --> 00:52:31.048
I work for Veotigo Insurance.

00:52:31.131 --> 00:52:32.716
Not in sales.

00:52:32.799 --> 00:52:36.470
I'm in the SIU Team.
I investigate insurance fraud attempts.

00:52:37.220 --> 00:52:39.181
No, that's not what I'm asking.

00:52:39.264 --> 00:52:40.641
Who are you, really?

00:52:45.854 --> 00:52:46.939
A friendly neighbor?

00:52:48.023 --> 00:52:48.857
What?

00:53:08.752 --> 00:53:10.337
Welcome back, sir!

00:53:11.129 --> 00:53:12.381
Sorry, I took too long.

00:53:14.216 --> 00:53:15.258
It's fine.

00:53:15.342 --> 00:53:16.760
It wasn't long at all.

00:53:19.346 --> 00:53:20.973
You know, your face...

00:53:22.808 --> 00:53:23.934
is pretty cute.

00:53:28.397 --> 00:53:29.439
Thanks for today.

00:53:31.233 --> 00:53:32.359
Oh, sorry.

00:53:33.318 --> 00:53:34.611
Hop in.

00:53:36.989 --> 00:53:38.699
- Okay.
- The key is inside, right?

00:53:38.782 --> 00:53:40.200
Yes, it's inside, sir.

00:53:42.661 --> 00:53:44.037
Goodbye, sir.

00:53:51.253 --> 00:53:53.547
Why isn't the GPS tracker returning here?

00:53:54.214 --> 00:53:55.674
Why is it going to Seoul?

00:53:55.757 --> 00:53:58.093
Do you think something went wrong?

00:53:58.176 --> 00:53:59.344
What happened?

00:54:00.929 --> 00:54:02.472
Stop it, will you?

00:54:02.556 --> 00:54:04.850
Why do you keep scaring us?

00:54:04.933 --> 00:54:06.143
What now?

00:54:06.226 --> 00:54:08.645
You said something about a GPS tracker.

00:54:08.729 --> 00:54:09.938
I did?

00:54:10.022 --> 00:54:11.440
- Did I?
- No!

00:54:12.149 --> 00:54:14.526
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

00:54:15.611 --> 00:54:16.862
CHOI KANG

00:54:17.195 --> 00:54:18.238
Answer it.

00:54:18.905 --> 00:54:20.949
- I will.
- Answer it.

00:54:21.408 --> 00:54:22.909
I was going to, okay?

00:54:27.039 --> 00:54:28.749
Hey, why are you calling so late?

00:54:28.832 --> 00:54:30.125
Why else?

00:54:30.208 --> 00:54:32.753
The mission was a success.
I'm on my way back.

00:54:33.170 --> 00:54:34.880
Oh, you're heading home from work?

00:54:36.048 --> 00:54:38.300
I thought you just had bad knees.
Is your hearing bad too?

00:54:38.634 --> 00:54:39.968
Yeah, I should kneel and pray.

00:54:40.052 --> 00:54:43.889
We should all pray
for Producer Kim's safe return.

00:54:45.223 --> 00:54:47.225
I'll send you the address. Meet me there.

00:54:47.309 --> 00:54:48.393
Okay, got it.

00:54:48.477 --> 00:54:49.978
Drive home safe.

00:54:52.397 --> 00:54:53.857
What is he saying?

00:54:56.735 --> 00:54:57.903
See?

00:54:57.986 --> 00:54:59.404
He's heading home from work.

00:54:59.738 --> 00:55:01.365
I heard everything.

00:55:03.450 --> 00:55:04.701
Stop lying!

00:55:05.452 --> 00:55:08.372
Who are you, the Bionic Woman? Gosh.

00:55:11.917 --> 00:55:13.043
We could hear everything.

00:55:15.170 --> 00:55:18.340
SAFE GAS STATION

00:55:37.734 --> 00:55:39.945
Nobody knows about this place,

00:55:40.028 --> 00:55:41.822
which should earn you some time.

00:55:53.542 --> 00:55:55.043
There are two storage units.

00:55:55.127 --> 00:55:58.171
Enter the unit on the right,
and push the barrels to the side.

00:55:58.547 --> 00:55:59.840
You'll see a door.

00:56:42.883 --> 00:56:44.134
What's all this?

00:56:57.230 --> 00:56:58.565
Good work.

00:56:59.483 --> 00:57:00.734
It may be inconvenient,

00:57:01.610 --> 00:57:03.153
but stay here for the time being.

00:57:03.236 --> 00:57:04.279
You'll be safe here.

00:57:15.624 --> 00:57:18.126
- How far are we going?
- Can you be quiet?

00:57:18.210 --> 00:57:19.169
Come on.

00:57:20.128 --> 00:57:22.756
- Walk faster, all right?
- Are you sure this is the right place?

00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:25.175
You sure this place is safe?

00:57:25.801 --> 00:57:27.511
Oh, gosh, Producer Kim!

00:57:38.438 --> 00:57:41.900
Well, I was going to come alone, but...

00:57:43.318 --> 00:57:44.611
- But what?
- What?

00:57:44.695 --> 00:57:46.029
What's your problem?

00:57:46.113 --> 00:57:47.155
Are we just strangers to you?

00:57:47.447 --> 00:57:49.199
No, we're much closer than that.

00:57:49.283 --> 00:57:50.534
Right, Byeong-nam?

00:57:50.617 --> 00:57:53.161
Of course. We're...

00:57:53.578 --> 00:57:56.748
We're close neighbors, like family.

00:58:00.711 --> 00:58:01.795
You heard that, right?

00:58:02.462 --> 00:58:05.257
They're my close neighbors, like family.

00:58:08.510 --> 00:58:09.469
Yes.

00:59:16.828 --> 00:59:19.748
HEROES NEXT DOOR

00:59:22.084 --> 00:59:23.585
It's here.

00:59:23.669 --> 00:59:24.503
Turn left.

00:59:25.253 --> 00:59:26.380
This way.

00:59:28.632 --> 00:59:29.967
Let me see that.

00:59:30.050 --> 00:59:31.426
No, I'm right.

00:59:31.510 --> 00:59:33.929
- Where are we going?
- Just follow me.

00:59:34.972 --> 00:59:36.098
This way.

00:59:45.065 --> 00:59:47.109
I knew it. You're all busted.

00:59:47.567 --> 00:59:50.237
I knew it when you left me alone
to watch the store.

00:59:50.320 --> 00:59:51.655
You're all busted!

00:59:59.746 --> 01:00:02.082
They definitely came this way.

01:00:06.336 --> 01:00:07.212
That's odd.

01:00:08.171 --> 01:00:09.131
Where did they go?

01:00:17.764 --> 01:00:19.057
Nam-yeon!

01:00:20.309 --> 01:00:21.435
Honey?

01:00:22.602 --> 01:00:23.729
Byeong-nam?

01:00:25.188 --> 01:00:28.650
You guys are so funny. This is hilarious!

01:00:28.734 --> 01:00:29.860
That's enough now.

01:00:29.943 --> 01:00:32.029
You can stop hiding and come out.

01:00:32.112 --> 01:00:33.572
I won't get mad.

01:00:34.239 --> 01:00:35.616
Yeah, this is hilarious.

01:00:36.366 --> 01:00:38.160
I can't go to sleep like this.

01:00:38.243 --> 01:00:41.955
Come on. Come out and talk.

01:00:42.789 --> 01:00:44.082
Where are you?

01:00:48.545 --> 01:00:50.631
Man, this sucks.

01:00:54.760 --> 01:00:56.511
Who snuck away the bombs?

01:00:56.595 --> 01:00:58.180
I guess some big names are involved.

01:00:58.263 --> 01:01:01.224
I hear you've been nosing around
here and there.

01:01:01.308 --> 01:01:04.436
How can we find that tiny button
in such a big area?

01:01:04.519 --> 01:01:05.354
Shall we begin?

01:01:05.437 --> 01:01:07.064
Are we going in immediately
once we find the location?

01:01:07.147 --> 01:01:09.691
- I have plans tomorrow evening.
- Cancel it.

01:01:09.775 --> 01:01:11.985
You've been acting weird
since moving here.

01:01:12.069 --> 01:01:13.695
So what's the plan?

01:01:13.779 --> 01:01:15.822
- They seem connected to Kim In-seop.
- Bring it on!

01:01:15.906 --> 01:01:17.199
Get your guys to look into them.

01:01:17.282 --> 01:01:19.868
Byeong-nam and Nam-yeon won't answer!

01:01:20.827 --> 01:01:21.995
You're dead.

01:01:24.498 --> 01:01:26.500
