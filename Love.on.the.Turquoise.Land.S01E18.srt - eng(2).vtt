00:01:59.184 --> 00:02:00.624
(Unknown Caller)

00:02:09.096 --> 00:02:10.376
We can cooperate.

00:02:10.935 --> 00:02:11.696
How?

00:02:11.895 --> 00:02:13.536
I've had people verify

00:02:14.175 --> 00:02:15.976
the Earth Fiend info you gave me.

00:02:17.376 --> 00:02:19.215
Once we gather sufficient intel,

00:02:20.935 --> 00:02:22.416
we'll make concrete plans.

00:02:22.856 --> 00:02:24.335
What else do I need to do?

00:02:25.296 --> 00:02:26.055
To wait

00:02:27.096 --> 00:02:27.856
and cooperate.

00:02:28.895 --> 00:02:30.335
Don't cause further trouble.

00:02:30.895 --> 00:02:32.296
After each call ends,

00:02:32.296 --> 00:02:34.055
I'll give you a new number.

00:02:34.655 --> 00:02:36.215
For any emergencies,

00:02:37.576 --> 00:02:38.976
inform me immediately.

00:02:52.144 --> 00:02:53.838
(Yan Tuo)

00:02:58.416 --> 00:02:59.016
Hello.

00:02:59.136 --> 00:03:00.055
Xing Shen agreed.

00:03:03.256 --> 00:03:04.096
That's great.

00:03:05.136 --> 00:03:05.856
Thanks.

00:03:06.615 --> 00:03:08.655
Why do you thank me?

00:03:09.895 --> 00:03:11.096
Without you,

00:03:11.215 --> 00:03:12.455
they'd never have trusted me.

00:03:15.016 --> 00:03:16.335
Let me ask you.

00:03:17.055 --> 00:03:18.455
If one day,

00:03:18.655 --> 00:03:20.376
all these issues get properly resolved,

00:03:21.215 --> 00:03:22.615
what would you do?

00:03:24.976 --> 00:03:26.136
What a tough question.

00:03:26.735 --> 00:03:27.935
I never thought about it.

00:03:28.615 --> 00:03:29.935
Or,

00:03:30.856 --> 00:03:31.615
I never dared.

00:03:31.976 --> 00:03:33.136
Then think about it now.

00:03:39.495 --> 00:03:40.816
I think

00:03:41.935 --> 00:03:43.175
being like you would be nice.

00:03:44.296 --> 00:03:45.096
How am I?

00:03:45.576 --> 00:03:47.655
Having your own small world,

00:03:48.136 --> 00:03:50.536
and doing what you love peacefully.

00:03:50.775 --> 00:03:52.576
To grow some plants

00:03:52.696 --> 00:03:53.495
and pet cats.

00:03:54.175 --> 00:03:56.536
So your inner world is so peaceful.

00:03:57.136 --> 00:03:57.856
Exactly.

00:03:58.615 --> 00:04:00.935
Actually, you get bored
living in a big villa,

00:04:01.416 --> 00:04:02.775
and now covet my small courtyard.

00:04:03.615 --> 00:04:04.615
I'll get you one.

00:04:06.335 --> 00:04:07.495
You are so generous.

00:04:08.935 --> 00:04:10.136
I'll mold you a clay version.

00:04:10.215 --> 00:04:11.615
Just look at it when you crave one.

00:04:12.536 --> 00:04:13.256
Fine.

00:04:13.495 --> 00:04:14.895
At least it's an artwork.

00:04:15.016 --> 00:04:15.935
Not a bad deal.

00:04:22.415 --> 00:04:23.095
Alright.

00:04:24.056 --> 00:04:25.855
Talk later. Bye then.

00:04:34.176 --> 00:04:35.576
Ms. Lin. You startled me.

00:04:35.736 --> 00:04:36.855
When did you get here?

00:04:42.295 --> 00:04:43.016
What's wrong?

00:04:43.016 --> 00:04:44.256
Do you need something?

00:04:44.855 --> 00:04:46.295
Same girl as last time?

00:04:49.056 --> 00:04:50.016
Net friend.

00:04:50.095 --> 00:04:51.056
Just chatting.

00:04:52.095 --> 00:04:53.335
Never realized

00:04:53.335 --> 00:04:54.816
you were so attractive to girls.

00:04:56.215 --> 00:04:57.295
What's wrong?

00:04:58.136 --> 00:04:59.136
Feeling guilty

00:04:59.376 --> 00:05:01.215
for only worrying
about Lin Ling's marriage,

00:05:01.215 --> 00:05:01.936
and now,

00:05:01.936 --> 00:05:03.056
you're anxious about me?

00:05:03.775 --> 00:05:04.576
No need.

00:05:05.376 --> 00:05:06.696
You meet important people.

00:05:07.295 --> 00:05:08.895
You must know many quality girls.

00:05:09.016 --> 00:05:10.095
Just make a match.

00:05:10.095 --> 00:05:11.660
I'll be more cooperative than Lin Ling.

00:05:15.095 --> 00:05:16.736
A beautiful,

00:05:17.736 --> 00:05:19.176
cultured

00:05:20.455 --> 00:05:23.335
and independent artist.

00:05:23.936 --> 00:05:25.335
I don't know

00:05:25.335 --> 00:05:27.376
any better girls than this.

00:05:29.256 --> 00:05:31.455
This girl is perfect

00:05:31.975 --> 00:05:33.496
and pleasing in every way.

00:05:34.415 --> 00:05:35.775
Except one thing

00:05:36.016 --> 00:05:37.415
I'm not assuring.

00:05:38.895 --> 00:05:40.256
Her background.

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:46.627
(Nie Jiuluo's Island)

00:05:52.376 --> 00:05:52.975
Hey, you.

00:05:54.095 --> 00:05:54.895
Did it on purpose?

00:05:55.655 --> 00:05:56.535
What do you mean?

00:05:57.455 --> 00:05:58.056
Come on.

00:05:58.975 --> 00:05:59.655
Stop pretending.

00:06:00.855 --> 00:06:02.176
Roadsound Group

00:06:02.295 --> 00:06:03.576
called me today,

00:06:04.576 --> 00:06:05.975
and requested you

00:06:07.016 --> 00:06:09.335
to create large sculptures

00:06:09.895 --> 00:06:11.295
for display in their compound.

00:06:12.256 --> 00:06:13.215
Roadsound Group?

00:06:13.936 --> 00:06:15.256
Ms. Lin, to be honest,

00:06:16.176 --> 00:06:17.576
many girls

00:06:17.655 --> 00:06:18.616
pursue me.

00:06:18.855 --> 00:06:20.415
But this artist girl

00:06:20.496 --> 00:06:22.136
plays hard-to-get

00:06:22.335 --> 00:06:23.455
and catches my attention.

00:06:24.376 --> 00:06:25.895
Thought I could've won her over

00:06:25.895 --> 00:06:27.616
after one night together.

00:06:27.895 --> 00:06:29.264
But I got too drunk that night

00:06:29.264 --> 00:06:30.264
and said something wrong.

00:06:30.264 --> 00:06:32.335
The next day, she just blocked me.

00:06:32.696 --> 00:06:34.256
Now I can't even reach out to her.

00:06:34.895 --> 00:06:35.975
Forget it. Doesn't matter.

00:06:36.496 --> 00:06:37.616
Since childhood,

00:06:38.095 --> 00:06:39.816
you can always get

00:06:40.016 --> 00:06:41.215
whatever you want.

00:06:41.775 --> 00:06:43.895
I can't stand seeing you
wronged like this.

00:06:44.176 --> 00:06:45.936
Don't worry. There are plenty of girls.

00:06:45.936 --> 00:06:46.816
You can make a match.

00:06:47.535 --> 00:06:48.455
All set.

00:06:49.415 --> 00:06:50.256
Her then.

00:06:52.016 --> 00:06:53.215
Lin Xirou, CEO of the group,

00:06:53.696 --> 00:06:54.895
invited you

00:06:55.455 --> 00:06:57.256
to their family dinner.

00:06:57.975 --> 00:06:59.455
Remember, it's a family dinner.

00:07:00.376 --> 00:07:01.576
I've already invited her.

00:07:01.855 --> 00:07:02.535
What do you mean?

00:07:02.535 --> 00:07:03.616
Invited her?

00:07:03.696 --> 00:07:04.855
Lin Xirou

00:07:06.176 --> 00:07:07.295
invited me to dinner?

00:07:08.056 --> 00:07:09.256
I'll meet her.

00:07:10.496 --> 00:07:11.215
Mad Hound.

00:07:11.576 --> 00:07:12.655
Mad Hound, right.

00:07:13.056 --> 00:07:14.535
Curator of the Mad Hound Art Gallery.

00:07:15.376 --> 00:07:16.215
Did it on purpose?

00:07:17.215 --> 00:07:18.576
Before, I connected you

00:07:18.576 --> 00:07:19.895
with Mr. Yan, the heir.

00:07:20.095 --> 00:07:22.176
And he connected you
with Lin Xirou, his mother.

00:07:22.576 --> 00:07:24.616
You have to one-up me, right?

00:07:24.975 --> 00:07:25.816
If it works,

00:07:26.176 --> 00:07:27.376
I'll play matchmaker.

00:07:27.936 --> 00:07:28.936
If it doesn't work,

00:07:29.576 --> 00:07:31.736
I will definitely vent your anger

00:07:33.376 --> 00:07:34.576
for you.

00:07:38.535 --> 00:07:39.335
Great!

00:07:39.616 --> 00:07:40.295
Thanks, Ms. Lin.

00:07:41.016 --> 00:07:41.576
Go.

00:07:42.215 --> 00:07:43.016
You must go.

00:07:43.775 --> 00:07:46.056
I want to see whether that Mad Hound

00:07:46.095 --> 00:07:48.736
can seal the deal
for you without my help.

00:08:09.496 --> 00:08:11.736
The dumplings and wontons
are frozen in the fridge.

00:08:12.095 --> 00:08:13.535
And a marinated beef

00:08:13.535 --> 00:08:14.936
is in the chiller.

00:08:14.975 --> 00:08:16.736
Slice it when you want to eat.

00:08:17.256 --> 00:08:18.936
I've cleaned the two fish Mr. Lu brought

00:08:18.936 --> 00:08:20.256
last time.

00:08:20.496 --> 00:08:22.056
You might feel troublesome to cook,

00:08:22.056 --> 00:08:23.095
so just keep them frozen.

00:08:23.496 --> 00:08:24.655
There are eggs.

00:08:24.936 --> 00:08:26.655
But I didn't stock many vegetables.

00:08:26.855 --> 00:08:28.496
Fresh ones are better.

00:08:28.696 --> 00:08:30.295
Mark my words.

00:08:31.136 --> 00:08:33.175
Eat less takeout

00:08:33.175 --> 00:08:34.575
and instant noodles.

00:08:35.815 --> 00:08:37.895
I'll wash the clothes,
bedsheets, and towels

00:08:38.336 --> 00:08:39.655
when I'm back.

00:08:42.096 --> 00:08:42.856
Miss Nie.

00:08:43.616 --> 00:08:44.496
Happy New Year.

00:08:46.535 --> 00:08:47.775
Happy New Year, Ms. Lu.

00:08:48.175 --> 00:08:49.456
Enjoy the time with your family.

00:08:50.055 --> 00:08:50.655
Leaving.

00:09:20.775 --> 00:09:22.216
They got the hotel

00:09:22.695 --> 00:09:23.895
surveillance footage

00:09:23.895 --> 00:09:25.016
when we were in Heyang.

00:09:25.695 --> 00:09:27.775
Then she knew about me

00:09:29.535 --> 00:09:31.496
and invited me through Lu for dinner.

00:09:32.136 --> 00:09:32.895
My bad.

00:09:33.895 --> 00:09:35.775
I was careless. Sorry.

00:09:39.096 --> 00:09:41.096
Who could've known
Lin Xirou would check there?

00:09:42.736 --> 00:09:44.016
Now we need to figure out

00:09:44.136 --> 00:09:45.456
how much she knows

00:09:45.695 --> 00:09:46.736
and what she suspects.

00:09:51.695 --> 00:09:53.415
If I don't go meet her,

00:09:55.895 --> 00:09:57.096
how can I figure it out?

00:09:59.055 --> 00:09:59.935
You would go?

00:10:01.256 --> 00:10:02.976
Since she found out about me,

00:10:03.136 --> 00:10:04.376
then she could come to my place

00:10:04.376 --> 00:10:05.376
any time.

00:10:06.376 --> 00:10:07.096
If I go,

00:10:07.456 --> 00:10:09.096
we don't know what'd happen.

00:10:10.256 --> 00:10:11.295
But if I don't go,

00:10:11.336 --> 00:10:12.895
it shows we're guilty

00:10:13.655 --> 00:10:14.616
and suspicious.

00:10:16.736 --> 00:10:18.496
I'll choose the better option.

00:10:19.295 --> 00:10:19.976
If I go,

00:10:21.336 --> 00:10:22.616
at least there's a chance.

00:10:23.616 --> 00:10:24.175
No.

00:10:24.415 --> 00:10:25.175
Absolutely not.

00:10:26.256 --> 00:10:27.496
You find somewhere to hide.

00:10:29.295 --> 00:10:31.216
Join the South Mountain Hunters.

00:10:32.935 --> 00:10:34.096
I can hide,

00:10:34.695 --> 00:10:36.136
but what about you?

00:10:36.895 --> 00:10:38.575
That'd make all our previous efforts

00:10:38.575 --> 00:10:40.415
and risks go in vain.

00:10:52.336 --> 00:10:53.535
Are you sure?

00:10:54.216 --> 00:10:55.655
If you take this step,

00:10:56.096 --> 00:10:57.535
there's no turning back.

00:10:58.456 --> 00:10:59.856
For Lin Xirou,

00:11:00.616 --> 00:11:02.376
this is also a risky move.

00:11:03.055 --> 00:11:05.256
Isn't she worried we'll just

00:11:05.736 --> 00:11:06.815
take her life?

00:11:15.456 --> 00:11:16.856
I don't want you to go,

00:11:17.895 --> 00:11:18.935
but if you insist,

00:11:20.775 --> 00:11:21.895
I'll go with you.

00:11:29.496 --> 00:11:30.895
I'll tell Xing Shen

00:11:31.415 --> 00:11:33.016
that if anything happens to us,

00:11:34.775 --> 00:11:35.695
he should immediately

00:11:35.695 --> 00:11:37.415
start to capture
those four Earth Fiends.

00:11:38.336 --> 00:11:39.016
Alright.

00:11:43.376 --> 00:11:44.336
Coming back from Heyang,

00:11:44.815 --> 00:11:46.336
we've always been separate.

00:11:47.575 --> 00:11:48.496
Anyway,

00:11:49.655 --> 00:11:51.175
we can fight side by side again.

00:11:57.655 --> 00:11:59.456
How did you tell Lin Xirou

00:11:59.456 --> 00:12:00.695
about our relationship?

00:12:02.136 --> 00:12:03.216
We're lovers.

00:12:05.055 --> 00:12:06.096
But I hurt you,

00:12:06.655 --> 00:12:07.695
so you ignored me.

00:12:10.415 --> 00:12:11.256
Lovers?

00:12:12.295 --> 00:12:12.895
Exactly.

00:12:14.016 --> 00:12:14.976
I thought

00:12:15.216 --> 00:12:16.655
I should tell a lie

00:12:16.655 --> 00:12:18.016
that has room for any excuses.

00:12:20.976 --> 00:12:22.616
A lie?

00:12:23.935 --> 00:12:25.256
So we aren't lovers?

00:12:25.496 --> 00:12:26.136
Right.

00:12:35.256 --> 00:12:37.415
Do you mean it's not a lie,

00:12:38.415 --> 00:12:39.535
but a truth?

00:13:18.610 --> 00:13:19.535
I wish it were a truth.

00:13:45.815 --> 00:13:46.815
Miss Nie, please.

00:14:11.856 --> 00:14:13.976
No, thanks. It's a bit cold.

00:14:15.295 --> 00:14:15.976
Then...

00:14:19.376 --> 00:14:20.175
Thank you.

00:14:33.575 --> 00:14:34.616
Welcome, Miss Nie.

00:14:35.456 --> 00:14:36.575
Hello, Ms. Lin.

00:14:38.895 --> 00:14:39.815
Hi.

00:14:41.496 --> 00:14:43.815
Ms. Lin, may I ask

00:14:44.295 --> 00:14:45.856
you invited me here today

00:14:45.895 --> 00:14:47.655
for my artwork

00:14:48.415 --> 00:14:50.575
or as a front for someone?

00:14:51.295 --> 00:14:52.136
Don't misunderstand.

00:14:52.736 --> 00:14:54.736
It's my mother who invited you here.

00:14:54.815 --> 00:14:56.096
I wasn't informed beforehand.

00:14:56.815 --> 00:14:58.016
If my presence

00:14:58.175 --> 00:14:59.376
will ruin your appetite

00:14:59.376 --> 00:15:01.216
or even jeopardize your collaboration,

00:15:01.216 --> 00:15:02.256
I can excuse myself.

00:15:04.295 --> 00:15:05.175
Go inside.

00:15:05.736 --> 00:15:06.655
We'll talk over dinner.

00:15:33.415 --> 00:15:34.376
Let me introduce you.

00:15:35.256 --> 00:15:37.655
Feng Mi,
a toxicology researcher from R&D.

00:15:37.695 --> 00:15:39.175
Xiong Hei, quality control manager.

00:15:39.695 --> 00:15:41.415
We were in a meeting this afternoon.

00:15:41.815 --> 00:15:44.175
They heard you'd come

00:15:44.175 --> 00:15:45.456
and wanted to meet you.

00:15:46.295 --> 00:15:48.136
Such a beautiful artist.

00:15:48.336 --> 00:15:50.216
You must sell works very well.

00:15:51.815 --> 00:15:53.016
In that case,

00:15:53.175 --> 00:15:54.775
Roadsound Group's success

00:15:54.775 --> 00:15:56.136
was due to Ms. Lin's beauty?

00:15:57.216 --> 00:15:59.055
Miss Nie, you look familiar.

00:15:59.935 --> 00:16:01.655
Have we met before?

00:16:02.336 --> 00:16:02.976
Have we?

00:16:05.456 --> 00:16:07.336
I don't socialize much.

00:16:07.575 --> 00:16:08.655
Especially

00:16:08.655 --> 00:16:09.775
medical big shots like you,

00:16:09.775 --> 00:16:11.096
I have no chance to interact.

00:16:15.616 --> 00:16:16.256
Glad to see you.

00:16:19.695 --> 00:16:20.376
Likewise.

00:16:22.336 --> 00:16:24.256
Shall we take a seat
before the flattery?

00:16:25.775 --> 00:16:26.415
Please.

00:16:44.055 --> 00:16:44.976
A toast

00:16:45.736 --> 00:16:46.736
to today's meeting.

00:16:47.695 --> 00:16:48.856
Thanks for your invitation.

00:17:04.135 --> 00:17:04.815
How is it?

00:17:08.095 --> 00:17:09.855
I'm no wine expert,

00:17:10.456 --> 00:17:13.575
but I detect floral notes.

00:17:14.095 --> 00:17:14.775
Rose?

00:17:16.456 --> 00:17:17.575
What a wine expert.

00:17:17.976 --> 00:17:19.696
We put carefully chosen oak barrels

00:17:19.855 --> 00:17:21.535
in the climate-controlled cellars

00:17:21.736 --> 00:17:23.335
for over a decade

00:17:23.496 --> 00:17:25.575
just to refine that hint of rose.

00:17:26.375 --> 00:17:28.815
Makes this vintage
worth tenfold of new wine.

00:17:30.256 --> 00:17:31.416
Worth it.

00:17:32.256 --> 00:17:33.896
Between artwork and commodity,

00:17:34.256 --> 00:17:36.736
sometimes there's only
a thin line apart.

00:17:37.696 --> 00:17:38.976
Yet that very line

00:17:39.135 --> 00:17:41.615
is what artists
spend lifetimes pursuing.

00:17:43.416 --> 00:17:44.375
Well said.

00:17:45.416 --> 00:17:46.896
Between a wine taster and a drunkard,

00:17:47.896 --> 00:17:50.016
reason and nonsense,

00:17:50.456 --> 00:17:51.696
there's also a thin line apart.

00:17:58.696 --> 00:18:00.216
Miss Nie, you're too refined

00:18:00.335 --> 00:18:02.256
for a sculptor.

00:18:04.615 --> 00:18:06.216
When I was moving clay alone,

00:18:06.216 --> 00:18:07.135
I did regret

00:18:07.375 --> 00:18:08.815
why I didn't choose painting.

00:18:08.936 --> 00:18:10.855
I could've traveled the world sketching.

00:18:11.615 --> 00:18:13.416
Why bother confining myself
to the studio

00:18:13.416 --> 00:18:14.696
covered in dust and grime?

00:18:16.976 --> 00:18:18.375
Sculpting

00:18:20.016 --> 00:18:21.135
requires knives, right?

00:18:25.775 --> 00:18:26.456
Yes.

00:18:26.936 --> 00:18:28.496
Sculpting knives are the primary tools,

00:18:28.775 --> 00:18:31.855
but we also use
hammers, chisels, shovels,

00:18:32.055 --> 00:18:34.135
chainsaws, drills,
and polishing machines.

00:18:34.295 --> 00:18:36.736
Like construction workers.

00:18:38.216 --> 00:18:39.416
Such hard work.

00:18:39.575 --> 00:18:40.736
You need proper nourishment.

00:18:41.855 --> 00:18:44.295
Have some giant grouper soup.

00:18:45.095 --> 00:18:46.335
It's okay. I'll serve myself.

00:19:02.936 --> 00:19:03.855
No cilantro.

00:19:12.216 --> 00:19:12.976
Doesn't matter.

00:19:13.615 --> 00:19:15.456
Certain ingredients must be combined

00:19:15.456 --> 00:19:16.696
to enhance the aroma.

00:19:17.496 --> 00:19:18.295
While some are

00:19:19.375 --> 00:19:20.375
clearly incompatible,

00:19:20.696 --> 00:19:21.736
if forced together,

00:19:22.016 --> 00:19:23.216
it'd only ruin the soup.

00:19:31.335 --> 00:19:32.216
Miss Nie,

00:19:33.335 --> 00:19:35.375
if I claim this invitation

00:19:35.615 --> 00:19:37.656
has nothing to do with Tuo,

00:19:37.896 --> 00:19:38.936
that would be a lie.

00:19:39.736 --> 00:19:41.256
You must've

00:19:41.335 --> 00:19:43.055
anticipated this before coming.

00:19:43.896 --> 00:19:44.575
Ms. Lin,

00:19:45.656 --> 00:19:47.775
no matter what your purpose is
for inviting me,

00:19:47.936 --> 00:19:49.535
I only came

00:19:49.855 --> 00:19:50.936
for the collaboration

00:19:50.936 --> 00:19:52.615
with you.

00:19:53.016 --> 00:19:53.936
Not just today,

00:19:54.095 --> 00:19:55.016
so will the future.

00:19:59.936 --> 00:20:01.095
Let's end here today.

00:20:01.696 --> 00:20:02.775
Come on, bottoms up.

00:20:07.896 --> 00:20:09.976
Business discussions
seem inappropriate now.

00:20:11.095 --> 00:20:12.055
How about this?

00:20:12.615 --> 00:20:13.896
I'll arrange another venue

00:20:13.936 --> 00:20:15.216
to host you privately.

00:20:17.335 --> 00:20:18.615
You even rejected a toast.

00:20:19.095 --> 00:20:20.176
Forget about it.

00:20:20.775 --> 00:20:22.736
Ms. Lin invited me today.

00:20:23.055 --> 00:20:24.216
Everyone present

00:20:24.575 --> 00:20:25.936
are Roadsound's leadership,

00:20:27.095 --> 00:20:27.815
including you,

00:20:28.176 --> 00:20:29.575
the distinguished Mr. Yan.

00:20:30.976 --> 00:20:32.335
I'm just a sculptor.

00:20:32.736 --> 00:20:33.896
I can't offend anyone.

00:20:34.775 --> 00:20:36.976
Let me toast Ms. Lin,
Ms. Feng, and Mr. Xiong.

00:20:37.256 --> 00:20:38.135
I'll take my leave.

00:20:38.375 --> 00:20:39.256
You enjoy the meal.

00:20:41.095 --> 00:20:41.936
Miss Nie,

00:20:42.896 --> 00:20:44.135
I'm sorry

00:20:44.575 --> 00:20:46.295
to invite you suddenly,

00:20:46.815 --> 00:20:48.335
offending you.

00:20:49.896 --> 00:20:51.016
As you wish,

00:20:51.615 --> 00:20:53.176
we'll talk about the collaboration.

00:21:00.176 --> 00:21:00.855
Tuo,

00:21:01.896 --> 00:21:03.216
finalize the afternoon's project

00:21:03.216 --> 00:21:05.176
with Xiong Hei and Feng Mi.

00:21:05.775 --> 00:21:06.775
I want to see

00:21:06.775 --> 00:21:10.016
the Shanjiang Institute
ribbon-cutting news this month.

00:21:11.256 --> 00:21:13.295
B-But I haven't eaten yet.

00:21:14.896 --> 00:21:16.295
Take this with you.

00:21:16.535 --> 00:21:17.815
Let's discuss while eating.

00:21:18.855 --> 00:21:20.016
Such a feast, and you...

00:21:20.016 --> 00:21:20.855
Let's go, Mr. Yan.

00:21:21.335 --> 00:21:22.055
Go work overtime.

00:21:26.375 --> 00:21:27.375
Okay, let's go.

00:21:39.936 --> 00:21:40.736
Where to?

00:21:41.416 --> 00:21:42.016
Come here.

00:21:43.216 --> 00:21:44.375
My apologies, Ms. Lin.

00:21:46.135 --> 00:21:47.256
I...

00:21:49.216 --> 00:21:51.135
A female artist commanding respect

00:21:51.456 --> 00:21:53.496
isn't easily established.

00:21:54.216 --> 00:21:57.095
It's tough for a woman
pursuing achievements

00:21:57.696 --> 00:21:58.615
independently.

00:22:01.976 --> 00:22:03.496
It's the voice of experience.

00:22:05.216 --> 00:22:06.456
Let me be frank.

00:22:07.016 --> 00:22:08.216
Collaborating with Roadsound

00:22:08.815 --> 00:22:09.775
worries me.

00:22:10.656 --> 00:22:11.256
How so?

00:22:11.335 --> 00:22:12.976
Though I loved art since childhood,

00:22:13.896 --> 00:22:15.295
I lack true talent,

00:22:15.496 --> 00:22:16.416
never reaching mastery.

00:22:17.375 --> 00:22:18.896
Thus, sculpture became

00:22:19.335 --> 00:22:20.295
my safe harbor.

00:22:21.055 --> 00:22:23.256
I'm content to find peace
on this harbor.

00:22:24.055 --> 00:22:25.176
I have no

00:22:26.696 --> 00:22:27.335
grand ambitions.

00:22:28.135 --> 00:22:30.615
Hence, what worries you
does not come from Roadsound,

00:22:30.775 --> 00:22:32.335
but your limitations to yourself.

00:22:36.736 --> 00:22:37.936
And Mr. Yan's affection.

00:22:42.575 --> 00:22:43.295
What now?

00:22:43.535 --> 00:22:44.456
I won't drink.

00:22:45.216 --> 00:22:46.176
If you don't mind,

00:22:46.176 --> 00:22:47.135
I'll check on Lin Ling.

00:22:47.135 --> 00:22:48.375
Tell me when Ms. Lin's done.

00:22:51.016 --> 00:22:52.696
You don't have to drink.

00:22:53.815 --> 00:22:54.696
Let's chat.

00:22:56.095 --> 00:22:56.936
About what?

00:22:58.696 --> 00:22:59.456
Girls.

00:23:03.535 --> 00:23:04.295
Alright.

00:23:05.696 --> 00:23:06.416
I've

00:23:07.416 --> 00:23:09.256
never felt timid

00:23:10.256 --> 00:23:11.615
when facing a girl.

00:23:12.216 --> 00:23:13.496
My heart raced.

00:23:14.256 --> 00:23:15.256
I couldn't meet her gaze.

00:23:17.496 --> 00:23:18.896
The first time I saw her,

00:23:19.936 --> 00:23:22.016
I didn't even clearly see her face.

00:23:22.615 --> 00:23:24.615
In our first encounter,

00:23:25.896 --> 00:23:27.535
we got a violent collision.

00:23:28.335 --> 00:23:29.335
(It's not his fault,)

00:23:30.095 --> 00:23:31.256
(but mine.)

00:23:32.256 --> 00:23:33.216
From then on,

00:23:34.335 --> 00:23:35.815
I completely captivated her.

00:23:37.016 --> 00:23:37.775
What?

00:23:38.295 --> 00:23:39.016
Let me go.

00:23:39.575 --> 00:23:40.575
In his eyes,

00:23:41.456 --> 00:23:42.896
perhaps I betrayed him.

00:23:45.375 --> 00:23:47.335
This man works for the Earth Fiend.

00:23:47.456 --> 00:23:49.456
But I only wanted to escape his control.

00:23:50.095 --> 00:23:51.896
I stormed into her studio out of anger.

00:23:52.135 --> 00:23:52.896
Yet she

00:23:53.016 --> 00:23:54.135
dared to lay hands on me.

00:23:58.535 --> 00:24:00.696
He shattered
what I cherished most in my heart.

00:24:05.295 --> 00:24:05.855
I...

00:24:06.936 --> 00:24:08.535
I had no choice but to let go.

00:24:09.976 --> 00:24:10.775
For her,

00:24:11.615 --> 00:24:12.976
I completely reinvented myself,

00:24:13.775 --> 00:24:14.896
and even considered

00:24:15.775 --> 00:24:16.896
running away with her.

00:24:20.696 --> 00:24:22.295
He completely lost his mind,

00:24:24.256 --> 00:24:25.775
dragging me into an abyss.

00:24:29.216 --> 00:24:30.295
But women...

00:24:30.855 --> 00:24:32.135
I genuinely admire your work.

00:24:32.135 --> 00:24:33.575
Just cater to their preferences

00:24:33.815 --> 00:24:35.176
and sweet-talk them,

00:24:35.176 --> 00:24:36.456
there is room to maneuver.

00:24:36.575 --> 00:24:37.375
Later,

00:24:39.176 --> 00:24:40.936
we did have several meals together.

00:24:43.855 --> 00:24:45.295
(We dated for a few times.)

00:24:46.896 --> 00:24:48.775
We did some crazy foolish things.

00:24:48.775 --> 00:24:50.496
You don't know what's in your own bag?

00:24:51.416 --> 00:24:52.656
No.

00:24:56.335 --> 00:24:57.936
We both made sacrifices for each other.

00:25:09.135 --> 00:25:11.496
But we can't forget the pain we endured.

00:25:12.135 --> 00:25:13.095
The pain is too deep...

00:25:17.216 --> 00:25:18.416
to ignore.

00:25:23.535 --> 00:25:25.295
I completely understand your stance

00:25:26.615 --> 00:25:27.896
and good intentions.

00:25:32.176 --> 00:25:33.016
But we

00:25:34.615 --> 00:25:35.775
can't truly go back.

00:25:36.656 --> 00:25:37.896
She would remain

00:25:39.416 --> 00:25:40.696
in my memory.

00:25:41.135 --> 00:25:42.456
Yet I hope

00:25:42.815 --> 00:25:44.256
that with time's passage,

00:25:45.936 --> 00:25:46.976
it could fade away.

00:25:59.176 --> 00:26:00.375
Ms. Lin wants you to see

00:26:01.295 --> 00:26:02.016
the guest out.

00:26:20.775 --> 00:26:22.256
The past is set in stone.

00:26:22.456 --> 00:26:23.775
While the future is yet to come.

00:26:24.456 --> 00:26:25.416
Regarding collaboration,

00:26:26.016 --> 00:26:27.775
we'll respect your opinion.

00:26:28.736 --> 00:26:31.135
But please let Tuo escort you home.

00:26:31.615 --> 00:26:32.775
Or I won't rest easy.

00:26:33.216 --> 00:26:33.815
Alright.

00:26:34.055 --> 00:26:34.736
Go ahead.

00:27:04.896 --> 00:27:05.535
Are you okay?

00:27:12.575 --> 00:27:13.976
Ms. Lin, go back.

00:27:14.135 --> 00:27:14.896
We're leaving.

00:27:25.216 --> 00:27:26.176
Verified?

00:27:26.575 --> 00:27:27.416
Kind of.

00:27:28.736 --> 00:27:30.736
You really think she's clean?

00:27:33.055 --> 00:27:34.135
Her figure from behind

00:27:34.416 --> 00:27:36.855
resembles the one who burned the farm.

00:27:37.656 --> 00:27:38.815
Then why let her leave?

00:27:39.016 --> 00:27:40.295
The New Year's coming.

00:27:40.696 --> 00:27:42.575
Let's settle all outstanding matters.

00:27:43.095 --> 00:27:45.656
So they won't plague the coming year.

00:27:47.095 --> 00:27:49.936
You're deliberately
sending Yan Tuo away?

00:27:51.375 --> 00:27:52.656
Summon Xiong Hei and Yang Zheng.

00:27:52.656 --> 00:27:54.256
I need you three to do something for me.

00:27:54.575 --> 00:27:55.176
Okay.

00:28:02.176 --> 00:28:03.176
Ms. Lin.

00:28:03.216 --> 00:28:05.535
Happy New Year!
May you grow ever younger.

00:28:06.055 --> 00:28:08.095
May you

00:28:08.295 --> 00:28:10.016
be free from others' envy,

00:28:10.535 --> 00:28:12.055
schemes from petty minds,

00:28:12.135 --> 00:28:13.295
worries about children,

00:28:13.416 --> 00:28:14.616
and anger toward subordinates.

00:28:15.295 --> 00:28:16.896
Coming here today

00:28:16.976 --> 00:28:18.855
not just to flatter me, right?

00:28:22.855 --> 00:28:23.456
Right.

00:28:24.055 --> 00:28:25.775
I also wanted to ask if Lin Ling

00:28:26.216 --> 00:28:28.095
wants to join me
for the New Year's countdown.

00:28:32.976 --> 00:28:33.775
Ms. Lin,

00:28:34.815 --> 00:28:35.855
I think

00:28:36.016 --> 00:28:37.176
this is a good opportunity.

00:28:38.095 --> 00:28:40.936
There are some things
I need to say to her privately.

00:28:42.216 --> 00:28:44.535
Don't let Sis and the others follow us.

00:28:46.496 --> 00:28:47.295
Don't worry.

00:28:48.095 --> 00:28:49.936
I'll keep sharing my location with you.

00:28:50.496 --> 00:28:53.016
I'll bring her back
safe and sound before dawn.

00:28:56.256 --> 00:28:56.896
Go ahead.

00:28:58.815 --> 00:28:59.815
Stay safe.

00:29:01.456 --> 00:29:02.295
Thank you, Ms. Lin.

00:29:02.815 --> 00:29:04.176
Happy New Year!

00:29:20.335 --> 00:29:21.256
Go to the hospital?

00:29:22.575 --> 00:29:23.335
No need.

00:29:24.295 --> 00:29:25.936
Fortunately, Lin Xirou didn't know it.

00:29:35.936 --> 00:29:37.135
What did you talk about?

00:29:40.736 --> 00:29:42.496
Just as what we thought.

00:29:43.936 --> 00:29:44.615
What about you?

00:29:47.095 --> 00:29:49.016
Kind of fooled Xiong Hei and Feng Mi.

00:29:53.176 --> 00:29:54.176
But I think

00:29:55.976 --> 00:29:57.375
Lin Xirou wasn't fooled.

00:29:59.256 --> 00:29:59.936
Of course.

00:30:01.335 --> 00:30:02.936
But since she let us leave,

00:30:03.936 --> 00:30:05.456
we should be safe for now.

00:30:07.016 --> 00:30:08.535
I've been watching our backs.

00:30:08.535 --> 00:30:09.335
No one's tailing us.

00:30:12.055 --> 00:30:12.896
Let's hope so.

00:30:14.295 --> 00:30:16.375
Hope this isn't the calm
before the storm.

00:30:23.696 --> 00:30:24.936
Why do doors in dramas

00:30:24.936 --> 00:30:26.176
always open so smoothly?

00:30:29.896 --> 00:30:31.055
Where are we going?

00:30:32.295 --> 00:30:34.615
Taking you to see New Year's Eve stuff.

00:30:35.615 --> 00:30:36.456
What's it?

00:30:49.976 --> 00:30:51.375
It's okay, not that severe.

00:31:00.496 --> 00:31:01.335
I'm hungry too.

00:31:01.496 --> 00:31:03.256
Didn't get to eat anything.

00:31:03.976 --> 00:31:04.575
Right.

00:31:04.815 --> 00:31:06.375
Who could eat in that situation?

00:31:08.615 --> 00:31:09.575
What do you want to eat?

00:31:14.456 --> 00:31:15.335
I'll make noodles.

00:31:16.335 --> 00:31:17.216
With two poached eggs.

00:31:17.976 --> 00:31:18.575
Okay.

00:31:38.575 --> 00:31:39.375
Nie Jiuluo!

00:31:39.976 --> 00:31:40.775
Nie Jiuluo!

00:31:42.256 --> 00:31:43.216
What's happening?

00:31:43.216 --> 00:31:44.575
Shut the water valve! Shut it!

00:31:44.575 --> 00:31:45.456
Where is it?

00:31:45.456 --> 00:31:46.456
This is your house.

00:31:46.456 --> 00:31:47.496
How would I know?

00:31:47.496 --> 00:31:49.135
I-I never handle these things.

00:31:49.135 --> 00:31:50.295
Ms. Lu handled them.

00:31:52.176 --> 00:31:53.135
Down there!

00:31:53.855 --> 00:31:54.815
Everything's soaked.

00:31:54.815 --> 00:31:55.736
Which one?

00:31:56.095 --> 00:31:57.216
Shut them all off!

00:31:59.936 --> 00:32:01.535
It's not working. None of these work.

00:32:01.615 --> 00:32:02.416
Can't shut it off.

00:32:02.416 --> 00:32:03.416
Here, hold this.

00:32:03.416 --> 00:32:04.416
I'll do it.

00:32:31.696 --> 00:32:32.976
Looks like it stopped.

00:32:33.496 --> 00:32:34.496
Yes.

00:32:37.016 --> 00:32:38.775
The bandage got wet. Needs redressing.

00:32:38.775 --> 00:32:39.736
It's fine. I'll...

00:32:39.736 --> 00:32:40.815
I'll handle it myself.

00:32:41.696 --> 00:32:43.095
Go take a shower.

00:32:43.095 --> 00:32:43.855
Don't catch a cold.

00:32:46.416 --> 00:32:47.016
Okay.

00:33:24.016 --> 00:33:24.656
This...

00:33:31.575 --> 00:33:32.416
Ms. Lu's not here,

00:33:32.416 --> 00:33:33.976
so we'll have to make do.

00:33:34.976 --> 00:33:36.775
Make do?

00:33:37.016 --> 00:33:38.216
This is the good stuff.

00:33:38.736 --> 00:33:40.295
A New Year's Eve feast.

00:33:40.416 --> 00:33:41.095
Of course.

00:33:41.095 --> 00:33:42.896
I even got you dessert.

00:33:44.496 --> 00:33:46.135
Have a tangerine. Wish for good fortune.

00:33:48.176 --> 00:33:49.936
Thank you then.

00:33:54.216 --> 00:33:56.535
Past midnight and no fireworks?

00:33:56.656 --> 00:33:57.696
Not lively at all.

00:34:07.736 --> 00:34:09.255
How did you light these candles?

00:34:10.255 --> 00:34:11.095
With a lighter.

00:34:11.496 --> 00:34:12.856
Where is it? Let me see.

00:34:15.055 --> 00:34:15.655
What for?

00:34:30.095 --> 00:34:31.095
What are you doing?

00:34:31.896 --> 00:34:32.776
You'll know then.

00:34:35.535 --> 00:34:36.615
Don't break it.

00:34:36.615 --> 00:34:38.416
I need it for incense and candles.

00:34:38.976 --> 00:34:40.376
Don't worry.

00:34:41.290 --> 00:34:46.544
(Do Not Imitate)

00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:53.000
(Do Not Imitate)

00:34:53.776 --> 00:34:54.575
Ready?

00:34:55.135 --> 00:34:56.215
For what?

00:34:57.095 --> 00:34:57.776
Nie Jiuluo.

00:34:58.936 --> 00:34:59.655
Happy New Year.

00:35:15.215 --> 00:35:15.856
How is it?

00:35:16.896 --> 00:35:18.296
This is your fireworks?

00:35:21.336 --> 00:35:22.135
Too short?

00:35:22.135 --> 00:35:23.456
Then I'll do it again.

00:35:23.856 --> 00:35:24.496
Wait...

00:35:40.856 --> 00:35:41.655
Thank you.

00:35:42.016 --> 00:35:43.336
It's nothing.

00:35:44.135 --> 00:35:46.095
Still a bit of a pity that we missed it.

00:35:46.376 --> 00:35:47.055
What's wrong?

00:35:48.215 --> 00:35:49.416
We missed the countdown.

00:35:50.175 --> 00:35:51.016
Doesn't matter.

00:35:51.615 --> 00:35:53.135
At least we didn't miss the fireworks.

00:35:54.336 --> 00:35:55.296
What?

00:35:55.735 --> 00:35:57.976
Who'd miss fireworks
they set off themselves?

00:35:59.615 --> 00:36:00.496
Make a wish.

00:36:09.215 --> 00:36:10.055
Tell me.

00:36:11.655 --> 00:36:13.016
Why do people always make wishes

00:36:13.055 --> 00:36:15.016
before fleeting things?

00:36:16.936 --> 00:36:19.175
Like shooting stars, fireworks,

00:36:19.535 --> 00:36:21.976
and birthday candles.

00:36:24.336 --> 00:36:26.735
Even if a wish comes true,

00:36:27.776 --> 00:36:29.135
would it also be fleeting?

00:36:34.095 --> 00:36:34.776
No way.

00:36:35.856 --> 00:36:36.776
Just think like this.

00:36:37.535 --> 00:36:39.856
When you pray to deities in temples,

00:36:40.496 --> 00:36:42.135
the Taoist statues just stand there.

00:36:42.496 --> 00:36:44.175
Make wishes or not, they'll be there.

00:36:47.936 --> 00:36:48.936
And I'll be here for you.

00:36:50.456 --> 00:36:51.016
Make a wish.

00:38:46.416 --> 00:38:47.095
Downstairs.

00:40:07.496 --> 00:40:08.496
Found anything?

00:40:10.496 --> 00:40:12.255
Nothing.

00:40:20.976 --> 00:40:22.496
Told you to search,

00:40:22.535 --> 00:40:24.215
not to wreck the place.

00:40:38.016 --> 00:40:39.896
He's always so tightly wound.

00:40:40.016 --> 00:40:41.095
I thought his house

00:40:41.095 --> 00:40:42.856
must have violent comics

00:40:42.856 --> 00:40:44.175
or dirty movies.

00:40:44.535 --> 00:40:45.936
Turns out we found nothing.

00:40:46.055 --> 00:40:47.816
Boring.

00:40:48.215 --> 00:40:49.016
Meaningless.
