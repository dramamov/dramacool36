[Legend of the Magnate]

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.940
[Episode 15]

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:39.710
Yimei.

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:42.509
Come on, sit down.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.180
You're a grown-up now.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.640
You need to mind your words.

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.479
Although our two families live close by,

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:58.350
once you're married,

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.350
don't run back home too frequently.

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.420
Your mother-in-law is a reasonable person.

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:03.280
Even I admire her when I

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.210
hear about how she handles things.

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:06.680
Besides, Pingyuan

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.210
wouldn't dare to upset you.

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:10.050
If there's really

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.610
something you can't get over,

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.460
you can always talk to your mother-in-law.

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:14.320
Remember that?

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.800
Father.

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:26.840
Finally, this day has come.

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:29.460
That day, when he told me

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:30.650
that he'd marry you very soon,

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.030
I felt I could die happy right then.

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:37.590
Good.

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:42.820
Do you think I'm not a good daughter?

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.180
Why are you rushing to send me away?

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:52.079
Sweetheart,

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:55.000
what did you just say?

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.340
I haven't thought about marriage.

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.970
Keeping you waiting for so many years,

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.520
that boy owes you a lot.

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.970
He knows it.

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:12.240
He'll treat you well.

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:15.030
Father,

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.030
he doesn't owe me anything.

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.020
And I don't need him to treat me well.

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.090
No one owes anyone anything in this world.

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:22.840
Please don't talk like this anymore.

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.550
If you want me to get married now

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:26.000
so that you can drive me out,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.000
then I'll do it.

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.190
Did you hear something from others?

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.590
Is that why you're
in a hurry to push me away?

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:35.310
You...

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:38.430
You...

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.520
W-What are you saying?

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.210
W-What do you think you're saying?

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.160
You're my own daughter!

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.230
How could I believe what others say?

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:57.810
Pingyuan risked his life,

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.190
rushing back and forth
to the military camp.

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:01.840
We all care so much about you!

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:03.150
You are really

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:04.360
pissing me off.

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:05.760
Hey, you...

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:07.630
Why are you being so difficult?

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:10.600
Look at these things.

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:13.190
Father!

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:14.150
Father!

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:15.500
Check them out!

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:17.240
Look at them!

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:18.360
Father, please come down.

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:19.620
I don't need your help.

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:20.350
Father.

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:22.000
Father!

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:24.270
Girl,

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:27.360
w-why are you being so stubborn?

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.950
Father,

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:40.360
I'm sorry, okay?

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.190
Girl.

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:58.870
Look at them.

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:00.960
Look at these things.

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:02.680
I've been saving every penny

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.320
from daily expenses
year after year to buy them.

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:04.970
How could you say

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:06.430
that I'm driving you out?

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:07.510
How could you say

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:08.710
something like that?

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:21.970
It's so infuriating.

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:26.080
I never said I wouldn't marry him, Father.

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:28.640
Why are you yelling at me?

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.630
The imperial court's troops are here!

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:54.870
[Battalion Commander of the Qing Army]

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:56.240
Where's your village head?

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:57.700
Here! I'm here!

00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:58.610
Commander!

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:00.360
I'll go over there. I'm going.

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:01.580
Let me go over there.

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:06.560
[Village Head of Shanjian Village]

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:07.360
C-Commander,

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:08.530
at your service.

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:10.350
Listen up.

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:12.800
Send 50 men each day

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:15.020
to mend the trenches outside the camp.

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:16.400
And get 50 more porters

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:18.030
to gather horse feed.

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:20.630
The General said
the troops won't enter the village

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:21.890
and won't disturb you.

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:25.720
The imperial court's troops are
truly honorable.

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:29.030
We'll get everything ready right away.

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:31.690
Here's the case.

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:34.040
We have marched thousands of miles,

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:35.480
risking our lives to get here,

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:37.010
and we're getting nothing?

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:40.420
How could we leave you empty-handed?

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:42.000
I need to go back to the village

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.730
to discuss with the villagers.

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:45.920
You know, over these years in this area,

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:48.240
there's been endless fighting
like a tug of war,

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:49.800
and all the tea plantations
have been burned down.

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.450
I also want to offer your soldiers

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:52.450
something.

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:55.480
But there isn't much we can provide.

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:56.920
Come closer.

00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:58.580
Commander...

00:06:58.580 --> 00:06:59.159
Commander...

00:06:59.159 --> 00:06:59.490
Well.

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:01.450
Sir...

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:03.420
Sir, please give me a hint.

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:06.850
After all these years of fighting,

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:08.720
every village has a few rich men

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.940
who are on good terms
with the rebels, right?

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:13.380
These people must be punished.

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:16.480
In the best case, they get exiled.

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:17.620
In the worst case...

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:19.090
Off with their heads!

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:24.460
Listen, buddy.

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:26.370
Go discuss with them if necessary.

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:27.980
To save your pathetic life,

00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:29.860
you need to pay a lot.

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:32.550
Off you go. I'll wait for you.

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:34.770
Move it!

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:37.170
Yes, Commander. I got it.

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:38.159
I'm leaving.

00:07:44.159 --> 00:07:45.090
Come on, Mr. Bai.

00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:46.120
Come on.

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:47.770
Take it slow.

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:49.950
Okay.

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:51.280
Here you go.

00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:54.870
Fetch a doctor.

00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:56.770
Any delay, and he won't get up again.

00:07:56.770 --> 00:07:57.310
Got it.

00:07:58.870 --> 00:07:59.450
Father!

00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:00.380
Don't worry.

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:02.770
I was scaring Pingwen a bit.

00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:04.280
Mr. Bai is having a phlegm blockage,

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:05.790
with his heart channels clogged.

00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:07.130
Don't be afraid, Mr. Bai.

00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:08.470
The doctor will be right here.

00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:10.800
The acupuncture treatment will cure you.

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:12.040
I...

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.530
Stop stuttering like this.

00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:17.170
Don't stand here crying.

00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:18.920
Go wait for me outside.

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:19.850
Go out first.

00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:23.040
Mr. Bai,

00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:24.870
it's alright, don't worry.

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:26.470
The doctor will be here soon.

00:08:40.669 --> 00:08:42.000
What happened just now?

00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:44.010
How did you get him this worked up?

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:46.320
Yimei,

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:49.030
don't be fooled by his closed eyes.

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:49.960
He can hear

00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:51.050
and understand

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:52.280
everything clearly.

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:54.360
Say more comforting words

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:55.220
to him later.

00:08:56.510 --> 00:08:57.570
If you talk back to him again,

00:08:57.570 --> 00:08:59.830
aren't you pushing him toward his grave?

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:03.740
Why did you save me?

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:06.080
If I had died in there,

00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:08.360
wouldn't you all be at peace now?

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:10.020
Why are you saying this again?

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.670
If I hadn't gotten you out of there,

00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:14.390
your father would have
passed away already.

00:09:14.390 --> 00:09:16.990
If anything happens
to my father because of me,

00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:19.460
I just don't deserve to live.

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:21.720
What should I do?

00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:24.510
What do you mean
by "don't deserve to live"?

00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:25.770
You're still so young.

00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:28.750
You were forcibly taken away

00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:30.150
by someone with a weapon.

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:31.700
You did nothing wrong.

00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:34.070
If anyone's to blame, it's them.

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:36.140
They couldn't stand up
to the imperial court themselves,

00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:36.960
so they came here,

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:38.150
throwing their weight around.

00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:39.100
Kidnapping women and children,

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:40.500
what the hell did they do?

00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:42.030
I think those guys are the ones

00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:43.490
who don't deserve to live.

00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:50.320
Mr. Bai!

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:52.240
Mr. Bai!

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:53.910
Mr. Xu.

00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:56.220
G-Gu, you're here.

00:09:58.360 --> 00:09:59.290
Where is Mr. Bai?

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:00.440
He was choked by phlegm just now

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:01.600
and won't wake up anytime soon.

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:03.400
Anything wrong? You can tell me.

00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:05.480
Come with me.

00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:09.080
Look.

00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:11.510
I'm just a minor village head.

00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:13.120
All I want is peace

00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:14.070
for the village.

00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:16.270
Those from the east

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:17.200
boss me around,

00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:18.530
and those from the west

00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:19.990
don't treat me any better.

00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:21.200
Gu, don't

00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:22.470
blame me

00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:24.080
for saying this.

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:25.100
Go on.

00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:30.290
The Battalion Commander
wants me to find those

00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:31.570
who work with the enemy in the village.

00:10:31.570 --> 00:10:33.360
In times like these,
everyone's trying to flee for their lives.

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:34.050
Where am I supposed

00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:35.250
to find any traitors?

00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:37.530
But once I accepted this task,

00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:39.150
I must deliver some results.

00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:40.040
So,

00:10:40.510 --> 00:10:41.460
you came to Mr. Bai's place

00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:42.520
for the "results"?

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:43.670
G-Gu,

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:45.720
you can't talk like this.

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:47.030
I also studied the books

00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:49.090
of morality and virtues from Mr. Bai.

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:50.750
If I do something like that,

00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:52.600
God will strike me with lightning.

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:55.000
I'm asking Mr. Bai
to figure out a solution.

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:57.270
His life is at stake! Hurry up!

00:10:57.270 --> 00:10:58.270
It's an emergency! Quickly!

00:10:58.270 --> 00:11:00.070
My shoes! They're slipping off!

00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:02.720
You brat...

00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:04.390
-Pingwen, give him a hand.
-I don't need your help.

00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:05.450
I can walk on my own.

00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:06.630
I'll do it myself.

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:08.980
Be careful.

00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:10.000
Come on.

00:11:11.770 --> 00:11:12.270
Well...

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:17.000
Wait.

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:18.630
Where are you going, Gu?

00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:19.550
Didn't you want to talk to me?

00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:19.840
No.

00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:21.930
I-I need to see Mr. Bai.

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:22.480
Hey.

00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:24.240
Where are you taking me?

00:11:29.570 --> 00:11:30.600
I'm Gu Pingyuan,

00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:32.430
seeking an audience with General Qiao.

00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:33.160
Bring him in.

00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:44.000
Sir.

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:46.610
Go ahead.

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:48.200
Sir,

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:49.740
Anhui's been going through

00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:51.340
really tough times the past few years.

00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:51.430
[General Qiao of the Qing Army]

00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:52.690
The ceaseless battles

00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:55.390
have drained all resources
from our countryside.

00:11:55.390 --> 00:11:55.870
We truly

00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:57.400
have nothing left to offer.

00:11:57.630 --> 00:11:59.440
The villagers thought
I might be able to work things out,

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:00.320
so they sent me over

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:02.150
to discuss
this matter with you, General.

00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:03.630
The imperial court owes us wages

00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:05.490
that haven't been paid for years.

00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:07.150
My men are risking

00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:08.750
their lives in battle,

00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:10.230
but what about their families?

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:11.230
What's your idea?

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:14.290
You must give your offerings.

00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:16.630
Arrest some traitors and beat them up.

00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:17.360
So you can get

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:19.330
the money from them.

00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:21.600
What?

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:28.180
Are you a traitor, too?

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:29.750
Sir,

00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:32.310
we truly have no silver to offer.

00:12:33.090 --> 00:12:34.110
The rebels set fire

00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:34.960
to our tea plantations

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:36.290
and burned everything.

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:38.630
The villagers just trade their possessions

00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:39.690
for new seedlings.

00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:41.220
We'll harvest a crop and sell the tea

00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:42.180
after the Qingming Festival.

00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:43.550
Only then will we have some income.

00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:45.440
You're asking me to wait until you

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:46.870
grow and sell your tea?

00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:49.040
Why don't you say you'll get married now

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:50.690
and raise your child to join the army?

00:12:50.690 --> 00:12:51.660
What a joke!

00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:52.630
Report!

00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:12.960
The map.

00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:14.710
[The four camps of the South Army
under the mountain have marched to Hefei.]

00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:16.430
[Chizhou Prefecture]

00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:22.960
Take him away.

00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:26.390
I'll deal with him
after I defeat the enemy.

00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:28.130
Relay my order!

00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:29.360
Break camp tonight!

00:13:55.550 --> 00:13:57.010
Do you have a fire starter?

00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:57.600
Yes.

00:13:57.640 --> 00:13:58.320
Go get it.

00:13:59.230 --> 00:14:00.550
And bring a small stove, too.

00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:01.150
Got it.

00:14:01.230 --> 00:14:01.960
Here you are.

00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:04.180
You're way too rough. Take it away!

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:05.920
Don't mess up

00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:06.840
my things!

00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:08.400
M-Move. Move aside.

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:13.910
Sir.

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:15.120
Put them down.

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:19.320
This medicine of mine is

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:20.440
a mix

00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:21.330
of gentian,

00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:23.000
musk,

00:14:23.250 --> 00:14:24.130
and pine oil.

00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:27.910
It clears all the senses
and soothes the spleen and stomach.

00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:29.370
One whiff will wake him up.

00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:43.490
Father.

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:53.630
Father.

00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:01.660
Don't rush to speak yet.

00:15:02.010 --> 00:15:03.550
Try to move your hands

00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:04.390
and feet.

00:15:13.510 --> 00:15:16.070
A second chance at life.

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:19.440
Thank you, Sir.

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:30.400
In the future,

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:31.510
you should take the patient out

00:15:31.510 --> 00:15:32.640
for walks more often

00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:34.170
and get some sunshine.

00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:35.600
This illness,

00:15:36.030 --> 00:15:37.630
though fatal when it flares up,

00:15:37.630 --> 00:15:39.960
will be fine
once the phlegm is coughed up.

00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:43.280
This is my prescription for you.

00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:44.050
You

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:45.480
should follow this prescription

00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:46.410
to get the herbs.

00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:47.440
They're

00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:49.610
surely available in Huizhou,

00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:51.360
but I'm not sure if there's

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:53.180
still fighting going on there.

00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:54.350
Fighting?

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:56.710
Haven't you heard
that the fighting stopped long ago?

00:15:56.710 --> 00:15:58.270
The soldiers
hunted them down to Liuhu Town

00:15:58.270 --> 00:15:59.600
and killed many people.

00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:02.170
They even killed the commanding general.

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:04.600
Dogs stop barking

00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:06.670
once they get some bones.

00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:08.760
With such a great achievement,

00:16:09.270 --> 00:16:11.930
they surely won't
mess with my brother anymore.

00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:12.910
Sir,

00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:14.270
this is so fragrant.

00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:15.440
Can I have one?

00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:18.920
Hands off my stuff!

00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:20.150
Give it back to me.

00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:38.960
Father.

00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:44.830
Tell me

00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:46.830
what I should do.

00:17:52.210 --> 00:17:53.270
Tell me.

00:17:55.070 --> 00:17:56.160
What should I do?

00:17:58.200 --> 00:17:59.480
What should I do?

00:18:03.730 --> 00:18:05.070
What should I do?

00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:15.720
Pingwen!

00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:16.600
Pingwen!

00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:17.440
[Two days later]

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:18.830
Pingyuan has returned!

00:18:20.130 --> 00:18:21.130
Pingyuan is back!

00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:23.600
Pingwen.

00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:25.200
Pingyuan is back.

00:18:25.890 --> 00:18:26.850
He's returned.

00:18:27.550 --> 00:18:28.270
Over there.

00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:30.810
Pingwen, slow down.

00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:31.640
You speed up!

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:33.840
I can't run anymore.

00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:35.240
Pingyuan.

00:18:35.610 --> 00:18:36.210
Pingyuan.

00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:37.250
Don't touch me.

00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:37.960
It hurts.

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:40.840
Pingyuan,

00:18:41.070 --> 00:18:42.270
you're finally back.

00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:45.000
Where are those soldiers?

00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:46.510
They won a great victory

00:18:46.510 --> 00:18:48.310
and broke camp to head for Hefei.

00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:51.150
Pingyuan, your hands...

00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:54.290
Let's go home quickly.

00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:56.200
Mother asks about you
hundreds of times a day.

00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:56.790
I lied to her, saying

00:18:56.790 --> 00:18:58.400
that you went down the mountain
to buy wedding gifts.

00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:00.600
Do I look like I'm buying wedding gifts?

00:19:00.790 --> 00:19:01.350
Tell her

00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:03.150
that I bought the gifts

00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:04.440
and sent them to Mr. Bai's house.

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:06.040
I'll come home after dinner.

00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:07.440
Her eyesight is poor at night,

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:08.960
so I can fool her and get away with it.

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:09.870
How is Mr. Bai?

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:11.790
Go check on him yourself.

00:19:11.790 --> 00:19:12.660
When we heard you got in trouble,

00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:14.320
he was worried sick about you.

00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:20.750
Yimei!

00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:23.070
Coming.

00:19:35.470 --> 00:19:36.400
Where is Mr. Bai?

00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:38.800
What happened to your hands?

00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:39.660
Oh dear,

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:42.070
they tied me up to prevent me

00:19:42.090 --> 00:19:43.150
from running away.

00:19:56.550 --> 00:19:57.070
Sir.

00:19:57.710 --> 00:19:58.680

00:19:59.030 --> 00:20:00.290
Pingyuan, quickly...

Don't talk.

Take good care of yourself.

00:20:05.610 --> 00:20:06.400
When you recover,

00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:07.730

Mr. Bai looks

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:15.410
much better now.

00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:18.310
The acupuncture treatment this morning

00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:19.830
helped clear the phlegm from his chest,

00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:21.190
and his body stopped trembling.

00:20:21.190 --> 00:20:22.160
The doctor said that it needs

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:24.270
10 consecutive days of treatment
to cure completely.

00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:26.270
Thanks to Pingwen, who ran quickly.

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:27.200
This illness,

00:20:27.550 --> 00:20:30.550
if not treated promptly,
could be life-threatening.

00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:31.880
Mr. Bai is blessed.

00:20:32.730 --> 00:20:34.460
The good days are ahead of you.

Hurry and pack your things.

00:20:49.590 --> 00:20:50.520
We need to leave.

00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:52.070
Leave?

00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:53.960
I'll prepare a carriage
for you and your father

00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:55.290
to go down the mountain.

00:20:55.830 --> 00:20:56.430
Why are you

00:20:57.170 --> 00:20:58.830
suddenly telling us to leave?

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.410
The situation has changed.

00:21:00.410 --> 00:21:01.940
If you stay here any longer,

00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:03.800
I'm afraid you'll be in danger.

00:21:04.010 --> 00:21:06.010
My father still needs acupuncture.

00:21:06.030 --> 00:21:06.700
If necessary,

00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:08.350
we'll take the doctor
down the mountain, too.

00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:08.920
Pingwen says

00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:10.270
he has a friend
at the foot of the mountain,

00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:11.260

You go hide there first.

If the situation remains tense,

00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:17.030
you can move elsewhere.

00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:18.920
Anyway, I have friends in Shanxi,

00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:20.250
and in the capital, too.

In this vast world,

00:21:21.610 --> 00:21:22.870
you can live anywhere.

If word gets around,

00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:39.250
it will spell destruction
for your entire family.

Someone must survive.

Pingwen also persuaded my father

00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:22.640
to let our family escape.

00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:24.000

have you been doing well?

00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:37.880
Me?

00:32:38.180 --> 00:32:39.980
No, I've been anything but well.

00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:41.450
You messed up

00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:42.510
my plan in Shanxi.

00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:50.000
Don't bother finding a way out.

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:51.200
It's not like Shanxi,

00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:53.970
where you could disappear into the crowd.

00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:57.010
Your home is right here.

00:32:57.100 --> 00:32:59.160
Your mother, your younger brother,

00:32:59.750 --> 00:33:00.920
and that

00:33:02.340 --> 00:33:04.730
beautiful Miss Bai.

00:33:06.310 --> 00:33:07.840
How do you know everything?

00:33:07.900 --> 00:33:09.050
I won't let the same person

00:33:09.050 --> 00:33:10.060
get me twice.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:12.370
If I hadn't investigated you thoroughly,

00:33:12.370 --> 00:33:13.700
how would I dare to come?

00:33:16.810 --> 00:33:18.480
I have something to show you.

00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:29.510
You got Yimei?

00:33:32.790 --> 00:33:33.400
Tell me

00:33:33.810 --> 00:33:34.680
what you want me to do

00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:35.540
to release her.

00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:37.250
You're such a hypocrite.

00:33:38.070 --> 00:33:39.240
Don't you know she can't stay

00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:40.640
in her hometown anymore?

00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:42.270
With her status as a collaborator,

00:33:42.270 --> 00:33:43.660
aren't you afraid
it'll implicate your mother

00:33:43.660 --> 00:33:44.660
and your brother?

00:33:45.450 --> 00:33:47.050
I came here today to meet you.

00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:48.040
Saving her was

00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:49.270
an unexpected gain.

00:33:49.550 --> 00:33:50.480
I'm begging you.

00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:56.700
Please take me to see her.

00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:04.540
[Li Cheng’s Military Camp, Hefei]

00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:25.130
It really is you.

00:34:27.489 --> 00:34:28.840
My men told me that you were here.

00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:29.840
I didn't believe it.

00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:32.040
But I didn't expect it to be you for real.

00:34:32.110 --> 00:34:32.860
Okay.

00:34:33.150 --> 00:34:33.880
I won't move.

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:36.260
You don't move either.

00:34:38.110 --> 00:34:39.510
Let's just stay like this

00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:41.219
and have a good talk.

00:34:46.909 --> 00:34:48.260
They said you died.

00:34:48.670 --> 00:34:49.940
Died in Liuhu Town.

00:34:56.300 --> 00:34:58.430
With iron grit embedded in your bones,

00:34:58.940 --> 00:35:00.000
not removed yet,

00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:01.780
it hurts on rainy days.

00:35:02.070 --> 00:35:03.670
You must pay attention to it.

00:35:04.030 --> 00:35:04.440
I...

00:35:06.380 --> 00:35:07.500
Looks like your jade pendant

00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:08.900
can really work wonders.

00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:10.240
You know what?

00:35:10.550 --> 00:35:11.880
I prayed to her every day

00:35:12.610 --> 00:35:14.170
just to let me see you again.

00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:15.940
For that, I'd even accept the fate

00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:18.270
of being torn into pieces with no regrets.

00:35:20.110 --> 00:35:21.240
Where are you going?

00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:27.450
Where are you going?

00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:28.960
Let me escort you.

00:35:36.030 --> 00:35:37.440
I have nowhere to go.

00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:43.110
Before I came, I thought

00:35:44.230 --> 00:35:45.490
that if you were alive,

00:35:46.770 --> 00:35:48.500
I'd like to tell you something.

00:35:55.780 --> 00:35:57.530
You can't just walk away

00:35:58.370 --> 00:35:59.830
after lighting up my life.

00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:18.470
These days,

00:36:18.710 --> 00:36:19.860
what's been embedded in my bones is

00:36:19.860 --> 00:36:20.990
not just iron grit,

00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:25.370
but also my longing for you.

00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:31.490
Stay.

00:36:32.450 --> 00:36:34.050
Even if it's just for one day,

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:35.920
to me,

00:36:37.190 --> 00:36:38.920
it's worth more than 100 years.

00:37:05.870 --> 00:37:10.680
[Gu's Mansion]

00:37:15.590 --> 00:37:16.070
Mother.

00:37:17.150 --> 00:37:17.880
You're back.

00:37:18.990 --> 00:37:20.390
This time, Mr. Bai

00:37:22.060 --> 00:37:23.860
won't pull through, I'm afraid.

00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:26.760
That's right.

00:37:32.230 --> 00:37:34.230
You and Pingwen are both lying to me.

00:37:34.890 --> 00:37:36.370
Both of you are fooling me.

00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:37.360
Mother.

00:37:38.550 --> 00:37:40.150
Where exactly did Yimei go?

00:37:41.930 --> 00:37:43.710
Those rumors spreading in the village,

00:37:43.710 --> 00:37:45.060
are they true?

00:37:48.340 --> 00:37:49.000
I saw

00:37:49.030 --> 00:37:50.670
that girl grow up.

00:37:51.070 --> 00:37:53.930
How did she change so much,
like a different person?

00:37:55.590 --> 00:37:57.200
Even if you no longer

00:37:58.180 --> 00:37:59.910
have an engagement with Yimei,

00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:02.360
you and your brother

00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:04.560
have received great favor from Mr. Bai.

00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:06.480
When you were little,

00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:08.760
Mr. Bai taught you to read and write,

00:38:08.780 --> 00:38:10.870
showing the same care as parents.

00:38:13.330 --> 00:38:14.880
During the years you were away,

00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:17.150
Yimei came
to take care of me from time to time.

00:38:17.150 --> 00:38:18.250
No matter what,

00:38:18.590 --> 00:38:19.670
you must find her

00:38:20.070 --> 00:38:21.940
and tell me the truth!

00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:22.760
Mother.

00:38:24.710 --> 00:38:25.690
Today, I...

00:38:26.590 --> 00:38:27.190
I saw an acquaintance

00:38:27.190 --> 00:38:28.390
at the military camp.

00:38:29.550 --> 00:38:30.490
She told me

00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:34.060
that Yimei went there.

00:38:36.330 --> 00:38:37.510
Where did she go?

00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:40.230
She said

00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:44.320
that Yimei went
to the Southern Army's camp

00:38:44.550 --> 00:38:45.070
to find

00:38:45.070 --> 00:38:46.730
that general called Li Cheng.

00:39:02.220 --> 00:39:03.420
What a troublemaker.

00:39:04.980 --> 00:39:06.420
You all screwed it up.

00:39:06.590 --> 00:39:08.070
What are you mumbling about?

00:39:08.070 --> 00:39:09.070
I'm saying that you

00:39:09.070 --> 00:39:10.470
might as well not have come back.

00:39:10.470 --> 00:39:12.270
You stirred up such big trouble.

00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:13.530
How is that my fault?

00:39:14.220 --> 00:39:15.510
She's already a grown-up.

00:39:15.510 --> 00:39:17.640
How can I meddle in what she wants to do?

00:39:17.650 --> 00:39:18.300
You all feel bad,

00:39:18.300 --> 00:39:19.800
like I don't feel upset, huh?

00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:21.730
Why is everyone taking it out on me?

00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:23.240
Well, after your return,

00:39:23.540 --> 00:39:24.280
I thought life

00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:25.650
would get better day by day.

00:39:25.650 --> 00:39:26.360
But now,

00:39:26.670 --> 00:39:28.330
it's getting worse every day!

00:39:28.730 --> 00:39:29.400
In my point of view,

00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:31.360
Bai Yimei is not
one of our family after all.

00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:34.120
You should take good care
of Mother and me first.

00:39:34.710 --> 00:39:35.480
Yimei's departure

00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:36.030
made the two

00:39:36.030 --> 00:39:37.340
old folks barely hold on.

00:39:37.340 --> 00:39:38.550
What am I supposed to tell them?

00:39:38.550 --> 00:39:39.840
Just persuade her to come back!

00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:40.880
Do I seem

00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:42.320
that persuasive or what?

00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:44.100
You think she'll listen to me?

00:39:44.100 --> 00:39:45.510
You're just shirking responsibility,

00:39:45.510 --> 00:39:46.550
not caring about anyone,

00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:47.400
not even me.

00:39:48.350 --> 00:39:49.590
How am I not caring about you?

00:39:49.590 --> 00:39:51.120
How are you caring about me?

00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:55.200
Let's sort this out.

00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:56.630
How long have you been back?

00:39:56.630 --> 00:39:57.380
Didn't you promise

00:39:57.380 --> 00:39:58.550
to teach me how to do business?

00:39:58.550 --> 00:39:59.610
Have you taught me?

00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:01.300
You also promised to help us

00:40:01.300 --> 00:40:03.030
make our lives better and better.

00:40:03.030 --> 00:40:04.430
Has it gotten any better?

00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:06.900
I'm just an ordinary folk.

00:40:07.090 --> 00:40:08.510
I don't have time to observe

00:40:08.510 --> 00:40:10.730
who's giving someone different looks

00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:12.210
or whose tone of voice has changed.

00:40:12.210 --> 00:40:13.000
But I do know

00:40:13.070 --> 00:40:15.510
that clothes and food all cost money!

00:40:15.530 --> 00:40:16.430
Keep it down.

00:40:17.100 --> 00:40:18.630
Getting someone to roast tea for sale

00:40:18.630 --> 00:40:19.630
also costs money!

00:40:19.670 --> 00:40:20.760
Big shots fighting down the mountain,

00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:22.420
what does it have to do with us?

00:40:22.430 --> 00:40:24.280
You might as well go back to Ningguta!

00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:24.670
I...

00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:34.800
I don't have time to fight with you today.

00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:36.030
Tomorrow, come with me

00:40:36.030 --> 00:40:37.090
down the mountain.

00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:42.210
All you do is boss me around.

00:41:00.110 --> 00:41:00.710
Pingyuan,

00:41:01.020 --> 00:41:02.090
you're being so mysterious.

00:41:02.090 --> 00:41:03.150
You haven't told me

00:41:03.150 --> 00:41:04.610
why you brought me to town.

00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:20.800
What are you looking for?

00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:23.220
What do you think?

00:41:23.220 --> 00:41:24.030
[Ping]

00:41:24.030 --> 00:41:24.960
What do you mean?

00:41:26.110 --> 00:41:27.630
This is the shop I rented for you.

00:41:27.630 --> 00:41:28.760
Go in and take a look.

00:41:30.710 --> 00:41:31.590
[Ping]

00:41:31.590 --> 00:41:32.750
You rented it for me?

00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:34.580
Why didn't you tell me?

00:41:35.790 --> 00:41:36.720
Here, take this.

00:41:42.710 --> 00:41:43.840
200 taels of silver?

00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:46.030
Where did you get so much money?

00:41:46.030 --> 00:41:47.320
I'm not forcing you to do anything.

00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:48.180
You can take this money,

00:41:48.180 --> 00:41:49.440
go straight back home,

00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:50.400
lock it in a box,

00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:52.560
and continue working in the fields.

00:41:53.490 --> 00:41:54.000
Of course,

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:55.010
you could also try

00:41:55.100 --> 00:41:56.400
this business of buying and selling,

00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:57.440
the life of a merchant.

00:41:57.440 --> 00:41:58.440
It's your choice.

00:41:59.670 --> 00:42:00.840
I've had enough of scratching out

00:42:00.840 --> 00:42:02.000
a living from the soil.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:03.530
I'll pick a different path.

00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:11.050
-Head Manager.
-Head Manager.

00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:12.300
Let me introduce you all.

00:42:12.300 --> 00:42:13.850
This is your real head manager,

00:42:13.850 --> 00:42:14.690
Gu Pingwen.

00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:15.570
I am the Boss.

00:42:16.150 --> 00:42:17.070
-Manager
-Manager

00:42:17.070 --> 00:42:17.590
Well...

00:42:18.270 --> 00:42:19.920
Go buy some food from the market.

00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:21.850
Your manager and I need to have a talk.

00:42:21.850 --> 00:42:22.710
Okay. Let's go.

00:42:37.070 --> 00:42:37.290
"Ping"?

00:42:37.290 --> 00:42:38.590
[Ping]

00:42:38.590 --> 00:42:39.140
Yes.

00:42:39.230 --> 00:42:40.230
What's your name?

00:42:40.230 --> 00:42:40.890
Gu Pingwen.

00:42:40.920 --> 00:42:41.440
That's right.

00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:42.590
Your name is Gu Pingwen,

00:42:42.590 --> 00:42:44.000
so this shop is called Ping.

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:44.710
From now on,

00:42:44.820 --> 00:42:46.220
this shop belongs to you.

00:42:47.050 --> 00:42:48.110
And I also selected

00:42:48.190 --> 00:42:49.710
those two assistants for you.

00:42:49.710 --> 00:42:50.630
They're loyal, reliable,

00:42:50.630 --> 00:42:51.630
and experienced.

00:42:52.310 --> 00:42:53.550
As for the 200 taels of silver,

00:42:53.550 --> 00:42:54.810
it's enough to pay them for a year

00:42:54.810 --> 00:42:56.340
and cover the cost of goods.

00:42:58.110 --> 00:42:59.190
So, Pingyuan, what business

00:42:59.190 --> 00:43:00.190
does this shop do?

00:43:00.630 --> 00:43:02.110
You're the head manager now.

00:43:02.110 --> 00:43:02.630
It's up to you.
