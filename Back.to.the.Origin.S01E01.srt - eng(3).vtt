00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.120
Would you like something to drink?

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:02.280
No?

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.040
Audio test?

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.280
One, two, one, two, one, two.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:06.320
Good day everyone,

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:07.040
I'm Zhang Ran.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:08.120
Hello, hello.

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.199
OK, OK, good.

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.680
Quick touch-ups!

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.360
Life seems to

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.520
always have its own plans.

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.000
I thought I would be

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.920
an interpreter.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.720
but now,

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:17.760
an anchor instead.

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:19.600
Which reminds me

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:20.480
of my favorite lines,

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.120
"life's like a box of chocolates,

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:24.360

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:39.920
"Oh yeah."

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.040
ready?

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:42.920
Not my thing.

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.520
Just one practice round,

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:45.280
please?

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.960
Really not my thing.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Just chime in

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.920
with "oh yeah"

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:48.400
on my cue.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.320
Not happening.

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.000
Stay on beat.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.520
C'mon.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:51.560
Stop being so stubborn.

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:52.320
C'mon, play along.

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:53.160
"Visible and invisible sights."

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.040
"Fleeting moments, endless nights."

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.600
"Watch the grass grow..."

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:56.440
I would like

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:57.480
to be compensated

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.200
based on your price match policy.

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:00.800
I bought this here

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:01.920
just three days ago.

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.320
Home Depot is now

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:04.400
10% cheaper.

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.040
Do you have anything to

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.920
prove this price difference?

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:07.680
Yeah, sure.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.560
OK.

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:10.880
Here.

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:12.880
Oh yeah, sure.

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:13.840
I'll fix this for you.

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:14.520
Thank you!

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:17.079
How'd it go?

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:18.240
Got it!

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:19.920
Awesome!

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:20.560
They tried the whole

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:21.960
"sold out in Toronto" line.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.120
Please.

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.320
As if I were

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:25.800
some first-timer.

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:26.560
They don't know

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.079
I'm the OG bag hunter.

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:29.560
Trying to hide it

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:30.520
behind the door?

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:31.200
Amateur move,

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:32.360
spotted it right away!

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:33.160
This way.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:33.720
Told them to

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:34.480
cut the act

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:35.400
and sell me the bag.

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:36.120
They tried

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.400
to dodge,

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:38.720
but look

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.000
who's got it now?

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:42.520
Sounds more like a conquest

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:44.320
than a purchase!

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:45.480
That's the name

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:46.000
of the game:

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.960
strategy and persistence!

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.440
But for your

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:49.600
shopping queen

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:50.560
here?

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.160
Just another day in the park for me!

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:55.520
Everything checked off?

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:56.120
Yeah!

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.400
Two hours in line,

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.120
my legs are screaming!

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:01.200
Tissue.

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:02.320
Get this, that Ping lady,

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:03.080
and the sales girl

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.120
go to the same church.

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:04.880
That's her secret

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.360
to scoring all the hot bags.

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.760
She's got the hookup!

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:09.120
Which Ping?

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:10.640
You know, Ping,

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:11.480
married that

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:12.880
old white prof from your school.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.360
She's teaching East Asian Lit.

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:15.880
Had turkey at their place

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.320
last Thanksgiving?

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:17.839
Remember?

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:19.760
You fixed their heating?

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:22.800
Hello? Earth to you.

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:23.520
I'm listening.

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.560
Four hours till home.

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:27.640
Should we

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:28.640
stop for food?

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.040
This design's fire.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.880
Never appreciated the print

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:32.800
when I was younger.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.240
My first

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.880
TV station bag

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:35.720
had this print.

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:37.400
It was bigger.

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.520
Just keep it if you're into it.

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:40.360
Three K?

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.840
Are you nuts!

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.200
Our top priority is building up

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.840
our savings.

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:44.320
Fu Yudong,

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:45.720
stop telling me to

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:46.760
keep everything!

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:48.560
The luxury aroma!

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.320
Well done, Zhang Ran.

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:54.480
Nabbing the impossible.

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.280
You've still got it.

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:05.160
One more dish

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.160
and we're good to go!

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:07.880
My queen, dinner's up!

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:11.000
Alright!

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:14.440
Client's impossible.

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.120
Now whining

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:20.040
about taxes!

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:21.800
Like that's the real problem!

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:22.880
Should've said no upfront.

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:23.720
What now?

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:26.560
Flip it to someone else.

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:27.760
At these prices?

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:28.920
No chance.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:30.880
Such a pain!

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:33.320
Better return it while I can.

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:34.360
It's gorgeous though.

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:36.520
Perfect for both style and practicality!

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:39.000
Why not

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:40.040
keep it?

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:41.480
That's insane. Too expensive.

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:42.320
I'll chip in.

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:44.280
Chip in?

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:45.280
That's half

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:46.040
your monthly salary gone.

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.480
Not happening!

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:47.600
It's not wasted

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:48.440
if you enjoy it.

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:50.320
It won't

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:51.400
put food on the table.

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:52.560
Plus,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.400
these are a big deal back in China,

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:55.000
but here?

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.120
Nobody gives a damn.

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:57.240
I'm not that

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.440
TV anchor anymore.

00:05:58.960 --> 00:05:59.720
Money's just a thing—

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:01.000
we'll make more, no big deal.

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:02.920
Look who's dropping rhymes.

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:03.520
Huh?

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:05.720
Never mind. Not happening.

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:08.160
We're

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:09.440
not broke.

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.040
Just keep it if you want

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:15.840
Gotta watch our spending.

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:17.120
Thought we were planning for a baby?

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:24.840
Honey.

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:26.720
Cheers to that!

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:37.960
Spot anything different

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:39.080
about dinner?

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:42.320
Extra kick?

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:43.360
Nah.

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:44.200
Larger portion?

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:45.280
Nope.

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:47.159
Healthier stuff?

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:47.880
You got it.

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:57.000
My queen!

00:06:58.920 --> 00:06:59.560
What's up?

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:00.280
Look this way.

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:01.480
Kind of busy here.

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:02.840
Make it snappy.

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:03.880
Just one quick turn.

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:07.760
Drop the knife!

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:10.520
What's...this?

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:11.400
Open it.

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:17.640
For me?

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:27.200
What an extravagance!

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:28.400
Got a gig.

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:31.320
You crazy spender!

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:32.000
Blowing money like that!

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.200
Didn't even run it by me!

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:33.880
Don't need a committee

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:35.040
for everything.

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:36.400
I got this!

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:37.680
Someone's feeling mighty today!

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:38.320
You know it.

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:40.560
No way, for real?

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:41.240
All yours, babe.

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:42.560
Got my circle bag!

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:45.320
Babe, I got my circle bag!

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:46.960
Got my circle bag!

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.040
Show me how it looks.

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:48.520
OK.

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:51.240
What'd you think? Good?

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:52.320
Killer!

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:53.600
Yeah? For real?

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:54.120
Amazing!

00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:55.360
How's it working?

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:57.240
Tell me!

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:59.120
Don't wear it like a drum!

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:05.640
How much was it?

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:07.120
Let's just say

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:10.440
it was a lucky find.

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:14.240
I appreciate it,

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:17.200
but let's cool it with the big spending.

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:38.440
Not even one like

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:40.159
on my pic.

00:08:40.159 --> 00:08:42.039
This circle bag's super rare,

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:43.559
don't they know anything?

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:48.040
Got one!

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:51.520
Stick to bathroom stuff

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:52.640
instead of thumbing ups!

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:05.040
Holy cow!

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:07.880
What now?

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:09.160
Raccoons back?

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:12.920
Nah, not raccoons.

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:14.840
Nothing.

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:18.480
Saw my like?

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:19.840
Yep.

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:20.800
Sweet!

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:40.920
Come on, eat.

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:42.440
Let me finish this first.

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:33.320
What's got you so hooked?

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:36.000
Prettier than me?

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:39.240
Yep, it is.

00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:44.720
What's with your head?

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:47.160
Here.

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:49.640
Oil popped

00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:50.800
while

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:51.960
making eggs.

00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:53.800
Slapped some toothpaste on it.

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:05.160
That garlic?

00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:07.360
Nah, orange.

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:08.920
Who mixes oranges with noodles?

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:09.800
Tastes awesome.

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:11.280
Orange

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:12.280
then noodles,

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:14.160
makes 'em taste all fruity.

00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:15.600
Here.

00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:28.120
Kinda.

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:35.560
Oops, my bad.

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:37.400
Fu Yudong,

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:44.040
I'm so divorcing you.

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:48.560
Fu Yudong,

00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:50.560
this work?

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:52.720
Fu Yudong,

00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:54.880
quit snoozing!

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:55.840
Does this work?

00:12:57.280 --> 00:12:58.040
Got that boss vibe?

00:12:58.920 --> 00:12:59.840
Looking corporate enough?

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:05.520
79, 80, 81, 82, 83,

00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:06.840
84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90,

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:09.880
91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96...

00:13:58.320 --> 00:13:59.240
Cut it out!

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:00.760
Can't focus! Kill that noise!

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:04.160
Just speeding you up.

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:05.360
Traffic's

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:06.480
gonna be nuts.

00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:07.320
Roads are clear.

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:08.160
Stop lounging,

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:09.440
go fix yourself up.

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:10.360
Hair done properly?

00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:11.360
All set,

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:12.400
ready whenever.

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:13.480
That's done?

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:14.720
What's with those

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:15.520
two strands sticking up?

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:18.720
It's styled this way!

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:19.200
Jeez!

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:20.640
Doing my face and gotta fix you up too!

00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:21.360
Just great.

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:22.080
Leave me be,

00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:22.880
just get

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:23.880
your makeup done.

00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:24.960
Let's roll already!

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:26.080
Nope, can't deal with that hair.

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:26.520
Babe,

00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:28.040
you're what makes me shine.

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:28.800
No way I'm wearing that.

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:29.560
Just slap it on.

00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:30.240
That's a chick's hat.

00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:31.760
Nah, it's for everyone.

00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:33.640
Pop it on, covers everything up.

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:34.720
Like that.

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:35.840
It's crushing my skull!

00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:36.720
Yeah, too tight.

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:37.400
Here.

00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:38.800
here's a bigger one.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:41.920
C'mon, on your head.

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:42.920
Nailed it!

00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:44.320
Killer look!

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:46.040
Total cowboy vibes!

00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:46.720
Looking

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:47.560
super fine now!

00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:48.480
Total hottie, proper gentleman!

00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:49.560
Go get the car running,

00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:50.600
be down in a sec.

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:52.400
Nah,

00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:53.320
hanging here with you.

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:54.160
- Move it.
- Going over there,

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:55.160
you'll be at this forever.

00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:56.320
Last bit, final touch,

00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:57.280
three count and I'm good.

00:14:57.640 --> 00:14:58.120
Three!

00:14:59.040 --> 00:14:59.840
Whatever!

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:02.040
Gotta change.

00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:02.880
You're stunning!

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:04.760
What's there to fix!

00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:06.640
Which one?

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:09.040
These all suck.

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:09.960
Should sorted it

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:10.720
last night.

00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:12.400
I did sort it,

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:13.320
why you saying I didn't?

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:17.360
Cool, she's five mins out.

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:21.360
Stop hugging that jacket,

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:22.040
get it on.

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:23.160
Here, AC's freezing.

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:24.560
Don't want it, it's your look.

00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:25.360
Put it on now,

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:26.960
quit carrying it.

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:27.720
If I put it on now,

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:28.440
it'll get wrinkled.

00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:29.960
You'll have to wear it anyway.

00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:32.680
Yeah,

00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:33.680
it'll be chaos

00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:34.720
when she shows up.

00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:37.520
Hold up!

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:38.680
Stand up.

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:41.440
What?

00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:43.240
Whose suit is this?

00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:44.280
Like you don't know,

00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:45.160
it's mine.

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:46.480
What's up?

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:47.400
Yours?

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:48.720
Wore this

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:49.720
at my PhD graduation.

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:50.920
Same tie and everything.

00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:51.920
Get that thing off!

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:52.680
C'mon, move it!

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:53.560
What's up?

00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:54.160
This thing's

00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:55.480
way too big!

00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:56.600
You look ridiculous

00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:57.640
in that.

00:15:57.680 --> 00:15:58.400
Looks like a rental!

00:15:58.560 --> 00:15:59.200
You wanted

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:00.440
fancy.

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:02.240
What's wrong with a suit?

00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:03.120
Just put it on your arm,

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:03.720
don't put it on.

00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:04.720
Shirt's fancy enough.

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:05.400
That works.

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:06.560
Put it there, quick!

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:07.720
On your arm,

00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:08.480
yeah, like that.

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:11.680
Forget this too.

00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:12.720
My bad,

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:13.520
totally my bad.

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:14.760
First wear it,

00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:15.920
then don't wear it...

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:16.840
Yeah yeah,

00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:17.640
I messed up, sorry.

00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:17.880
Hands off,

00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:18.720
I got this styled.

00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:19.920
No you don't.

00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:20.640
No style at all!

00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:21.840
Quit messing with it.

00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:23.480
Hey, when she

00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:24.480
shows up,

00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:25.280
just smile,

00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:25.920
don't be all stiff.

00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:26.600
Gimme a smile.

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:29.160
That's super stiff.

00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:29.920
At home

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:30.960
you're such a goofball!

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:36.160
Can you just act normal?

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:36.920
Yeah, chill,

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:38.000
I got this.

00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:43.400
Ran!

00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:45.880
Yuan Yuan!

00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:48.600
God, I missed you!

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:49.680
Been ages!

00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:51.120
Jeez, how're you still so young!

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:52.160
What's your secret?

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:53.240
Ya think?

00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:53.880
So young, like seriously.

00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:54.720
You're looking fab.

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:55.360
Hanging in there.

00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:56.360
Love that bag!

00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:57.680
Here, lemme introduce,

00:16:57.840 --> 00:16:59.240
my hubby Ethan,

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:01.360
Yuan Yuan.

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:02.920
Nice to meet you.

00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:04.160
He's Chinese, Mandarin's fine.

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:04.560
Hi.

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:05.119
Chinese, yeah.

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:06.640
Hi there.

00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:07.960
He's got a PhD

00:17:10.119 --> 00:17:12.040
from RUT.

00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:14.560
How long's it been since you gals met?

00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:15.839
Oh, like a century.

00:17:17.079 --> 00:17:17.880
Lemme snap a pic.

00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:18.400
Nah.

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:19.720
So uh,

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:20.599
should we

00:17:20.599 --> 00:17:21.400
go and grab

00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:21.720
some food?

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:22.560
Yeah yeah,

00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:23.640
let's chat on the way.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:24.839
Gimme my phone.

00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:26.560
Wow,

00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:27.240
you look taller!

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:28.079
He's such a looker!

00:17:28.079 --> 00:17:29.160
Yeah? He's OK.

00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:30.480
He's OK.

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:32.200
C'mon, let's move.

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:47.080
There's more.

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:49.080
Didn't order much.

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:51.200
You're rarely here.

00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:52.840
Table's

00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:54.360
packed already.

00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:55.600
Thanks.

00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:56.160
Enjoy.

00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:57.880
So, how's

00:17:58.040 --> 00:17:59.000
your house hunting?

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:01.000
Ugh,

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:03.360
total letdown, waste of time.

00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:04.320
No good, huh?

00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:06.280
So I checked it out...

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:07.800
Thanks, dig in.

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:09.760
Eat up.

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:12.400
Prices are super cheap.

00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:14.080
A huge house here,

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:15.200
that's just

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:16.720
pocket change for me!

00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:18.200
Found two

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:19.720
I kinda liked,

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:21.200
but they're

00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:24.280
a bit rough inside.

00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:26.280
This is what you get in here.

00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:27.240
Yeah?

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:28.600
Yup, gotta redo everything inside.

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:29.400
Buying old houses here

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:30.840
is the smart move.

00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:32.560
Fix 'em up,

00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:33.320
and you're good whether

00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:34.800
you're living in it or investing.

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:36.200
If you end up buying

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:37.160
and need work done...

00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:39.040
He knows

00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:40.520
these Chinese contractors,

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:42.320
super solid.

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:43.520
If you buy something,

00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:44.840
need fixes, just hit him up

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:46.120
for contacts,

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:47.000
right babe?

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:49.560
Prob won't need that.

00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:51.560
Inside's whatever,

00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:52.800
but man,

00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:54.080
opened the door, saw the hood,

00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:56.960
way too backwoods!

00:18:57.280 --> 00:18:58.640
Then I'm like,

00:18:58.840 --> 00:18:59.480
even if I bought it,

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:00.520
would I actually crash here?

00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:02.040
Got such a sweet gig, y'know,

00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:03.440
can't just ditch it!

00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:05.960
Ran,

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:06.640
no offense!

00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:07.280
None taken.

00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:08.760
I'm just basic,

00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:09.760
not fancy like

00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:10.840
you two brainiacs.

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:11.320
Nah, nah!

00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:12.840
You guys can do the whole zen thing,

00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:15.520
I need action in my life.

00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:16.200
Yeah.

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:17.760
For investing,

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:18.800
you ain't gotta

00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:19.760
live in it.

00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:21.960
Yeah, ran the numbers,

00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:23.560
doesn't stack up

00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:24.840
against my places

00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:26.200
back home.

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:27.760
Realtor said

00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:28.400
these

00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:29.520
big houses

00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:31.280
are a pain to rent,

00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:32.520
rent's cheap too,

00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:34.080
then there's property tax

00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:35.720
and upkeep costs...

00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:36.720
Gotta think

00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:38.560
this through more.

00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:40.040
Yeah, house buying's no joke.

00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:40.560
Right.

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:41.760
Gotta think it through.

00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:42.400
Eat up, guys.

00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:43.160
Yeah!

00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:44.640
We're actually

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:45.800
looking to move too,

00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:47.720
talking it over.

00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:49.040
Your place looks amazing,

00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:49.640
why move?

00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:50.640
Saw it on your posts.

00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:51.280
So jealous.

00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:52.600
Yeah, want something bigger.

00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:54.320
Cool!

00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:54.840
That's

00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:55.840
gotta be

00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:57.280
a big deal.

00:19:58.040 --> 00:19:59.160
Should be easy-peasy

00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:01.080
for folks like you, right?

00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:02.600
Everyone's gotta

00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:03.320
budget,

00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:04.200
no matter who they are.

00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:04.960
True.

00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:09.720
C'mon, eat.

00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:10.960
Eat up, babe.

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:11.760
Yeah.

00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:13.040
Ran,

00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:14.520
haven't seen you

00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:15.560
working much lately.

00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:17.440
Baby plans?

00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:20.000
Actually thinking of

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:21.000
doing an MBA this year.

00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:22.400
I

00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:23.440
got super interested

00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:24.720
in international trade

00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:25.720
and procurement stuff,

00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:26.600
wanna give it a shot.

00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:28.320
International procurement's

00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:29.040
where the money's at.

00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:29.560
Right?

00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:30.560
Though it could be treacherous.

00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:31.240
Yeah.

00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:32.520
Finally figured it out,

00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:34.160
at our age,

00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:35.040
y'know

00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:37.720
it's about making the right choices.

00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:39.720
Oh yeah,

00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:41.920
you heard Zhou's hanging it up?

00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:43.440
Yeah, I know. He mentored me.

00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:44.680
So get this,

00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:46.120
new boss comes in,

00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:47.800
they're begging me to stick around.

00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:49.480
But here's the kicker,

00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:51.320
there's this

00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:52.040
huge internet company

00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:52.480
trying to grab me.

00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:53.880
Want to build me

00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:54.960
this whole new platform,

00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:56.320
run my own show.

00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:57.560
I'm kinda

00:20:57.760 --> 00:20:59.160
stuck here,

00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:01.080
can't make up my mind.

00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:02.440
Ran, help a girl out,

00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:03.920
should I bounce

00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:04.960
or stick around?

00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:06.040
Babe, see how

00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:07.200
they fight over the good ones?

00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:08.800
She's the example.

00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:10.280
You'll crush it wherever you go,

00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:11.440
you make everything better.

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:11.800
Nah, nah.

00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:12.720
You're amazing too.

00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:13.280
Yeah.

00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:13.920
You're the best.

00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:16.520
Oh, Mr. Perfect Husband over here.

00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:17.560
You got it.

00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:20.000
I seriously look up to Ran.

00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:21.960
Look at her,

00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:22.960
all zen-like,

00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:24.520
living in her own bubble,

00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:25.400
no drama.

00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:26.160
Not like me,

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:28.640
I'm such a mess.

00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:29.080
Yeah.

00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:30.720
never satisfied,

00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:32.520
always gotta shake things up.

00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:34.000
Pretty bad, right?

00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:35.120
That's good, actually.

00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:37.080
Ran, I mean every single word

00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:38.320
right now. Do you believe me?

00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:39.000
I do.

00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:40.160
If you hadn't

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:41.000
suddenly left.

00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:43.160
How could I ever be

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:45.040
a financial broadcaster?

00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:46.920
I wouldn't be here without you.

00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:51.520
There's something else.

00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:52.880
My memory is terrible these days.

00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:53.600
That...

00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:54.720
I have a book

00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:55.720
that's about to be published.

00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:57.680
"All About Finance."

00:21:57.920 --> 00:21:59.360
Once it's out,

00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:00.680
I'll send you a copy.

00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:02.160
Please give me some feedback.

00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:03.720
Definitely. Send it over ASAP.

00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:05.160
I wouldn't dare critique it.

00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:06.480
But I'll read it carefully.

00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:08.800
Allow me to propose a toast.

00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:09.280
Sure.

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:11.040
Toast to Ran.

00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:12.600
Hold on.

00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:14.120
A special toast to Ran.

00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:15.320
Let's sit down.

00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:16.880
A bit much?

00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:18.080
Yes, a bit.

00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:19.560
Ran, here's to you.

00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:21.720
Thank you for bowing out.

00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:22.880
For giving me

00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:24.160
a life-changing opportunity.

00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:26.160
I'll finish it, you do as you please.

00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:33.520
You didn't have to.

00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:35.000
Good wine.

00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:35.920
Thank you.

00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:36.440
No worries.

00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:37.560
I think

00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:39.400
You should really go back

00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:40.800
to visit and look around.

00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:41.840
I can arrange everything.

00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:42.360
Right?

00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:43.520
Sure. When we have time,

00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:44.440
we will.

00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:45.320
Are you considering?

00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:45.840
Yes.

00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:46.360
I'll introduce you

00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:47.440
to my husband.

00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:48.480
He works in private equity.

00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:52.280
How did you meet?

00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:52.960
You and your husband?

00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:54.360
Now that you mention it,

00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:54.880
it's similar to

00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:55.920
the way you met Pierce.

00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:57.200
Very similar.

00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:57.720
Really?

00:22:57.720 --> 00:22:59.160
He came to the station for a show

00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:00.000
and then started

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.600
pursuing me like crazy.

00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:03.280
Of course, his net worth

00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:04.400
is no match to

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:05.720
your Pierce.

00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:07.760
But everyone has their strengths.

00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:09.320
He's very tolerant.

00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:10.640
Leaves me alone.

00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:11.760
That's good.

00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:16.840
Me being...

00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:18.640
I talk too much when I drink.

00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:21.840
Ethan knew about Pierce?

00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:22.720
I did.

00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:23.480
You did?

00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:24.560
Great. I thought

00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:25.320
I misspoke.

00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:26.800
It's fine. As a couple,

00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:28.000
we have no secrets.

00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:29.640
We respect

00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:30.480
and trust each other.

00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:32.360
When we first met,

00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:33.480
we put all our cards on the table.

00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:34.000
Right, hubby?

00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:34.400
Yes.

00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:36.240
That's wonderful.

00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:37.760
You two are a match made in heaven.

00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:39.000
He treats me well.

00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:41.000
Let's eat.

00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:41.560
Eat up.

00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:42.160
Eat, eat.

00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:42.800
Let's eat.

00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:43.960
Too much talking.

00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:45.880
Why aren't you eating?

00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:46.920
I've been eating non-stop.

00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:48.480
You're the one talking

00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:49.080
and not eating.

00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:49.440
Sorry.

00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:51.320
When I drink, I ramble

00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:51.800
a lot.

00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:52.840
I'll have some greens.

00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:53.560
Here.

00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:56.440
We'll drive you.

00:23:57.320 --> 00:23:58.080
No, no need.

00:23:58.120 --> 00:23:59.000
Let us drive you.

00:23:59.040 --> 00:23:59.840
No, listen to me.

00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:00.880
It's nearby.

00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:01.720
No traffic here.

00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:03.560
It's fine, Ran.

00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:04.640
You already paid for the meal.

00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:05.560
It's just a quick drive.

00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:07.200
No, no. Really.

00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:08.320
Here's why.

00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:09.880
My husband's

00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:12.040
friend lives nearby.

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:12.800
Very close.

00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:14.320
He wants to buy me a drink.

00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:15.880
So I'll just walk over

00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:17.360
to help digestion.

00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:19.120
It's fine. Don't worry.

00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:20.320
Have fun then.

00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:20.880
I will.

00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:21.440
We're heading off.

00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:21.760
Okay.

00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:25.560
Isn't this your car?

00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:29.160
Yes, it is.

00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:30.880
I'll get going then.

00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:31.320
Listen.

00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:32.640
If I come here to retire,

00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:33.400
I'm coming to you.

00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:34.120
You have to.

00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:34.520
If you don't,

00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:35.720
I'll be mad at you.

00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:36.480
You have to take me in.

00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:37.160
Absolutely.

00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:38.520
Ethan.

00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:40.040
Be careful.

00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:40.800
Will do, will do.

00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:41.880
Right, you didn't drink.

00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:42.960
Take care.

00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:44.080
Okay, okay.

00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:46.000
Thanks for everything.

00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:46.400
Bye.

00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:46.840
Bye.

00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:48.640
Don't mention it.

00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:49.480
Bye bye.

00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:27.680
Thank you for bowing out.

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:28.800
For giving me

00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:29.960
a life-changing opportunity.

00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:30.840
If you hadn't

00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:31.760
suddenly left.

00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:33.960
How could I ever be

00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:35.640
a financial broadcaster?

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:37.600
I wouldn't be here without you.

00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:39.320
Now that you mention it,

00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:40.200
it's similar to the way you

00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:40.840
met Pierce.

00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:42.480
Very similar.

00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:44.240
He came to the station for a show

00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:45.040
and started

00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:46.560
pursuing me like crazy.

00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:49.800
I seriously look up to Ran.

00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:51.040
Look at her,

00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:52.720
all zen-like,

00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:54.240
living in her own bubble,

00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:55.160
no drama.

00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:55.960
Not like me,

00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:58.360
I'm such a mess.

00:25:58.360 --> 00:25:59.520
Whatever I do,

00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:00.520
I'm never satisfied,

00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:02.280
always gotta shake things up.

00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:04.200
Finally figured it out,

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:05.920
at our age,

00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:06.840
y'know

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.400
it's about making the right choices.

00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:52.040
"Visible and invisible sights."

00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:53.160
"Fleeting moments, endless nights."

00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:54.120
"Watch the grass grow,"

00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:55.640
"see the snow drift away. Oh yeah!"

00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:57.000
All about nailing that

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:57.600
"Oh yeah."

00:27:57.880 --> 00:27:58.760
Join in,

00:27:58.760 --> 00:27:59.600
ready?

00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:00.440
Not my thing.

00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:02.200
Just one practice round,

00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:03.000
please?

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:04.000
Really not my thing.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:05.000
Just chime in

00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:05.600
with "oh yeah"

00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:06.200
on my cue.

00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:07.160
"Visible and invisible sights."

00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:08.000
"Fleeting moments, endless nights."

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:09.760
"Watch the grass grow, see the snow drift away."

00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:11.000
Really not my thing.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:11.600
You.

00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:13.600
Come on, Fu Yudong.

00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:14.920
Just "Oh yeah."

00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:15.560
Hurry.

00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:16.880
"Visible and invisible sights."

00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:18.000
"Fleeting moments, endless nights."

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:19.760
"Watch the grass grow, see the snow drift away."

00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:20.600
"Oh yeah."

00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:22.240
Oops, I cut it wrong.

00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:00.960
Lunch time!

00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:02.680
Come on!

00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:04.760
All meat dishes today.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:06.640
I spent a fortune.

00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:08.040
All meat?

00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:09.120
Definitely.

00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:09.960
Come on.

00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:10.800
Thanks, boss.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:11.960
It's discounted.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:12.800
Don't act like it's a favor.

00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:14.760
Eat up, back to work.

00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:15.760
Still good stuff.

00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:17.280
Yeah. Before the client

00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:17.720
comes to me

00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:19.120
complaining about this and that.

00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:20.000
Seriously.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:22.320
Our team survives on being

00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:25.080
hardworking, efficient, and cheap.

00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:25.600
Yeah.

00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:26.240
Also.

00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:27.400
I'm off to

00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:29.680
a very important meeting.

00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:30.440
Wish me luck.

00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:31.400
Good luck.

00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:32.160
Thanks.

00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:37.080
Cheap stuff.

00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:38.440
Probably two for one.

00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:44.000
Go on. Come on.

00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:46.840
Go.

00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:53.400
Doctor, you're not eating?

00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:54.160
Mind your own business.

00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:54.720
He'll eat later.

00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:07.400
Have you lost your mind?

00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:10.880
That's dangerous!

00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:11.960
What are you doing?

00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:13.080
Sorry, sorry.

00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:13.720
Sorry, boss.

00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:16.000
Hurry up, I'm in a rush.

00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:17.520
Why are you taking off your belt?

00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:18.440
What for?

00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:20.640
Boss.

00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:24.560
I need to talk to you.

00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:29.000
I've been working with you

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:30.360
for such a long time.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:31.840
But you're still

00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:33.360
paying me 16 dollars an hour.

00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:35.600
I need a house and start a family.

00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:38.080
I really admire you, Dr. Fu.

00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:39.280
Really.

00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:40.600
But you know

00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:42.440
your current wage

00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:43.440
is decent.

00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:46.080
Business is tough.

00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:46.480
Right?

00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:47.600
I have to pay taxes.

00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:48.760
And my labor costs

00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:49.680
are so high.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.240
All my client resources,

00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:51.600
I built them

00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:53.920
over 18 years.

00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:55.520
If you go out on your own,

00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:57.800
you won't even afford food.

00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:00.080
Feikun in Chinatown.

00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:01.160
He offers

00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:02.600
20 dollars an hour.

00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:03.600
So what?

00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:04.840
He has no jobs.

00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:06.840
Even if he offered 200 an hour,

00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:08.320
he still has no jobs.

00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:11.240
At least with me,

00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:13.680
you get 4,000 dollars a month.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:15.920
Be content, brother.

00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:18.320
Besides,

00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:20.920
though you know some utilities,

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:23.280
you don't have a license.

00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:24.520
Even if you

00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:25.840
go outside,

00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:27.440
they'll pay you less.

00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:29.240
I really

00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:31.720
treat you like a brother, like family.

00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:33.120
That's why I don't mind.

00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:34.840
Boss.

00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:37.200
I'm Fu, you're Li.

00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:37.960
In the Hundred Family Surnames

00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:39.360
we are pages apart.

00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:41.160
I'm not worthy of being your family.

00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:42.320
What do you mean?

00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:43.920
What I just said.

00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:44.360
You didn't

00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:45.600
listen at all, did you?

00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:48.120
Sir, you don't have an electrician license.

00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:49.520
A licensed electrician in Toronto

00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:51.120
makes 60 dollars an hour on average.

00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:53.120
Me? I'm getting 16.

00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:54.840
I don't have a license.

00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:55.960
But,

00:31:56.320 --> 00:31:57.120
I know

00:31:57.120 --> 00:31:57.840
the theoretical foundation well.

00:31:57.840 --> 00:31:58.760
I'd even say that

00:31:58.880 --> 00:31:59.800
I do a better job

00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:00.520
than those electricians.

00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:03.600
I saw it the other day.

00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:05.480
A client asked you:

00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:06.120
"Does anyone

00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:07.120
in this crew,

00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:08.520
have an electrician license?"

00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:10.800
You showed them my diploma.

00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:13.080
You said I'm a Ph.D.

00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:14.480
That I do the same work

00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:15.640
as a licensed electrician.

00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:18.080
How much money did I save you?

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:21.440
I work nine hours a day.

00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:22.040
You only pay me

00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:23.400
for eight hours.

00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:24.240
I never asked

00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:25.200
for overtime pay.

00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:27.080
Out there,

00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:28.680
just for a temp helper.

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:29.920
That's at least

00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:31.200
25 dollars an hour.

00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:33.440
I do plumbing, electrical and tiling.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:34.840
If you wanted to find

00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:35.480
someone like me,

00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:36.440
how much would it cost you?

00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:37.080
Over these years,

00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:38.080
how much have I saved you?

00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:41.160
So, what do you want?

00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:41.840
I want a raise.

00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:43.720
I can't give you

00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:45.240
the 60 dollars of an electrician.

00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:47.000
Stop daydreaming.

00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:48.240
Per hour.

00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:49.640
26 dollars.

00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:51.960
Impossible. An hour...how much?

00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:01.240
26 dollars.

00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:08.680
Listen here, kid.

00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:09.960
It's your lucky day.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:10.840
I'm in a hurry.

00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:12.000
26 dollars, deal.

00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:15.040
Now please.

00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:16.840
Get out.

00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:18.840
I'm in a hurry.

00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:19.680
Okay?

00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:27.440
Alright.

00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:30.640
Go.

00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:31.160
Ok.

00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:34.440
What a weirdo.

00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:36.120
Boss.

00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:37.920
You can trust me.

00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:38.480
I...

00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:40.040
Yeah.

00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:42.400
Thanks, boss.

00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:44.200
You're welcome!

00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:02.040
Done.

00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:03.480
Thank you.

00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:04.200
No problem.

00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:05.400
Let me get you some water.

00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:05.960
No need.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:07.720
So polite.

00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:10.080
I noticed your house

00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:11.840
has some old wiring.

00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:13.239
The voltage is unstable.

00:34:13.239 --> 00:34:14.239
Does the breaker trip often?

00:34:14.639 --> 00:34:16.440
Yes, it trips often.

00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:19.280
Would you like

00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:20.239
to consider

00:34:20.239 --> 00:34:21.199
a full house inspection?

00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:22.440
Upgrade to a larger panel.

00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:23.760
Like a 200-amp one.

00:34:24.239 --> 00:34:25.280
You have an EV.

00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:26.440
The EV charger,

00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:27.560
according to code,

00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:28.880
should have a dedicated circuit.

00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:29.600
it'll be safer

00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:30.520
in this way.

00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:32.199
Even if there's a wiring issue,

00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:33.080
it won't affect

00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:34.000
your home insurance.

00:34:34.159 --> 00:34:35.400
If you're interested,

00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:36.440
contact me anytime.

00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:37.960
I'm Fu Yudong.

00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:39.719
I can provide a few

00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:41.239
affordable power solutions.

00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:42.440
Depending on your needs.

00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:44.520
Sounds good.

00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:46.120
Let's exchange contacts.

00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:47.000
Yes.

00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:48.480
Do you have WeChat?

00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:54.840
Nice one, kid.

00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:56.360
Once you got your license,

00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:57.280
you started side gigs.

00:34:58.440 --> 00:34:59.640
Why work yourself so hard?

00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:01.240
Weren't you pretty carefree?

00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:03.200
Buying a house.

00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:05.240
Your wife's demand?

00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:07.040
She said we can have kids once we buy a house.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:09.720
Your wife...

00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:11.080
Never mind.

00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:12.520
I won't say more.

00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:16.440
Say what you want to say.

00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:17.440
It's fine.

00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:21.040
Let me tell you something.

00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:22.280
That's what she says now.

00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:24.320
Wait till you buy the house.

00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:26.520
I'm taking a leak.

00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:30.880
What do you mean?

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:32.800
Just wait and see.

00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:35.720
We have two sizes.

00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:36.600
Which one do you want?

00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:37.800
Big one.

00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:39.320
Okay, let me wrap it for you.

00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:40.120
Thank you.

00:35:58.640 --> 00:35:59.040
Nice.

00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:03.800
You're in the frame.

00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:04.440
Let me.

00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:06.800
Take a good one.

00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:12.840
I'll punch you.

00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:13.960
When I turn,

00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:15.040
you need to capture it.

00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:16.440
One, two, three, go.

00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:18.960
Great.

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:19.760
Just like that.

00:36:23.240 --> 00:36:24.040
Good.

00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:28.240
Let me see.

00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:28.720
No.

00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:29.440
Show me.

00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:29.960
No.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:30.520
Let me look.

00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:31.600
No, it's really good.

00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:32.600
Impossible. Show me.

00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:33.240
It's really great.

00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:33.560
Come on.

00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:35.600
Why has no one

00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:37.440
liked my Moment yet?

00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:39.280
This bag is rare.

00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:40.680
Do they not get it?

00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:45.280
There's one.

00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:49.320
Fu Yudong, go to your toilet.

00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:49.800
Stop messing.

00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:53.760
The third one is

00:36:54.680 --> 00:36:55.280
50% off.

00:36:56.120 --> 00:36:57.560
Basically buy one get one free.

00:36:57.640 --> 00:36:58.320
We can share it.

00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:01.400
No, calories are enemies.

00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:03.640
I'm dieting.

00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:05.560
You're already so thin.

00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:06.440
Why diet?

00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:06.880
You don't understand.

00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:09.040
Get a drink then.

00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:10.400
Can't. Need to be dehydrated.

00:37:10.520 --> 00:37:11.360
I need to be thin to win.

00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:14.120
Close your eyes. You won't feel hungry.

00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:16.400
If you don't eat or drink,

00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:17.280
you'll close them forever.

00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:19.960
People will ask why your wife

00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:20.600
is so skinny.

00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:21.920
I'll say she's dieting. How?

00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:23.440
Breathing.

00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:25.240
Order. I'll watch you eat.

00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:26.280
I'm queuing.

00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:45.240
Give me a bite.

00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:48.200
Meds.

00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:50.240
Meds.

00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:04.160
Spit it out.

00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:07.280
Nothing.

00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:17.480
Say it.

00:38:19.160 --> 00:38:19.800
Am I old?

00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:21.120
Is my face sagging?

00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:23.080
Whatever you say.

00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:28.440
What for?

00:38:29.560 --> 00:38:30.240
Lights out. Sleep.

00:38:37.320 --> 00:38:37.920
Fu Yudong.

00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:47.840
Doctor, want a lift?

00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:48.520
No thanks.

00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:50.320
My wife is on her way.

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:51.240
Go on.

00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:52.400
Drive safe.

00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:53.280
Okay, bye.

00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:09.240
Drive safe.

00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:48.000
What's going on?

00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:56.240
I was

00:39:56.240 --> 00:39:56.800
standing there,

00:39:56.800 --> 00:39:57.640
and you didn't see me?

00:39:57.720 --> 00:39:59.280
I didn't...I saw you.

00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:00.040
I made a U-turn.

00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:01.000
So when I came

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:01.800
from the right,

00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:02.560
you don't have to walk

00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:03.360
to get in.

00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:05.040
Sorry, Hubby.

00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:05.800
Kept you waiting.

00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:06.680
Massage tonight.

00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:09.480
Tired?

00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:10.200
Rest a bit.

00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:17.600
Hubby, next week I want to treat

00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:19.040
an old colleague to dinner.

00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:20.240
She's from China.

00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:22.800
I want to book that Cantonese Restaurant.

00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:24.440
Don't you have a coworker

00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:25.320
who knows the

00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:26.520
owner very well?

00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:28.080
Treated her illness?

00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:28.800
Or something?

00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:29.640
Can you ask?

00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:30.600
See if we can get a discount.

00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:35.680
Watch the road.

00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:36.600
I am watching.

00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:41.080
If you sleep now,

00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:42.040
will you sleep tonight?

00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:46.280
One more thing.

00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:47.040
Your boss,

00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:48.080
he has a BMW, right?

00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:48.760
Let's borrow it.

00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:03.240
Why aren't you going back?

00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:04.480
Boss.

00:41:08.520 --> 00:41:09.760
Can I swap my car

00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:11.600
with yours for a bit?

00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:13.360
Why?

00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:17.920
Don't you have a pickup?

00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:19.040
Just one day.

00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:22.200
I have a special occasion.

00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:23.520
You can't...

00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:28.600
Thanks, boss.

00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:31.080
Here.

00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:32.480
Thank you.

00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:33.320
Can you drive it?

00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:33.600
Yes.

00:41:35.560 --> 00:41:36.840
Give me your keys.

00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:42.600
91 octane gas.

00:41:42.760 --> 00:41:43.480
Don't get it wrong.

00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:44.000
Thanks, boss.

00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:49.040
Eat a bit more?

00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:50.040
I'm full.

00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:51.480
The cowlick.

00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:52.160
Oh my god.

00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:54.120
Just hanging there.

00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:55.200
It's called style.

00:41:56.040 --> 00:41:57.480
Ran, you're so lucky.

00:41:58.440 --> 00:41:59.480
While living abroad,

00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:00.680
finding a great man like Ethan.

00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:02.240
I think he,

00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:03.320
compared to Pierce,

00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:05.040
is so much better.

00:42:05.880 --> 00:42:07.400
You can say that louder.

00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:09.600
Way better than Pierce!

00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:11.600
What do you mean?

00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:14.320
We're drunk.

00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:15.560
You didn't drink at all.

00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:17.000
Drink up. Have fun.

00:42:17.320 --> 00:42:18.800
So considerate.

00:42:19.240 --> 00:42:20.120
This gesture,

00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:22.080
my husband would never.

00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:23.440
Pouring wine, getting tissues.

00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:24.280
Never.

00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:25.480
Your husband doesn't carry things?

00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:26.080
No.

00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:26.560
No.

00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:27.720
Too heavy?

00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:29.400
You're hilarious.

00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:30.080
Ma'am.

00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:31.560
Here is your bill.

00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:32.200
Okay.

00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:37.560
I really can't.

00:42:37.720 --> 00:42:38.960
A drop left. Don't waste it.

00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:39.960
Thanks.

00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:40.760
Bottoms up.

00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:42.200
Done eating?

00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:43.720
It was wonderful.

00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:44.640
Couldn't be better.

00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:46.760
Please select the tip amount.

00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:47.840
And enter your PIN.

00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:48.640
Okay.

00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:51.840
Our restaurant

00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:53.240
defaults to 30%.

00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:55.320
For other amounts,

00:42:55.720 --> 00:42:57.040
press the option keys.

00:42:57.680 --> 00:42:59.440
Okay. 30% is fine.

00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:03.240
Thank you.

00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:05.000
Do you want these leftovers

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:05.600
to go?

00:43:06.160 --> 00:43:06.800
No thanks.

00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:07.800
Okay.

00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:08.680
I'll ask the valet

00:43:08.680 --> 00:43:09.640
to bring your car around.

00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:10.200
Okay.

00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:11.440
Enjoyed the meal?

00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:12.800
Thanks. You shouldn't have.

00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:13.240
My pleasure.

00:43:13.240 --> 00:43:14.080
My pleasure.

00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:15.720
One last toast.

00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:16.360
Last toast.

00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:16.800
Cheers.

00:43:18.200 --> 00:43:18.840
Happy.

00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:20.360
Joy.

00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:20.800
Here.

00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:27.600
I can't drink.

00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:32.240
Let's go.

00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:32.960
Let's go.

00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:33.920
Go.

00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:35.920
Thank you for the treat.

00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:37.240
It's nothing.

00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:39.680
Let's go.

00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:41.680
I'll treat you when you go back home.

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:42.880
You better.

00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:47.520
Craving anything specific?

00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:49.480
Anything you miss?

00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:49.800
No.

00:43:50.120 --> 00:43:50.520
No, nothing.

00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:51.520
We can get everything here.

00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:52.120
Right, right.

00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:37.520
Hubby, a UFO!

00:47:40.320 --> 00:47:40.960
Still won't get up?

00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:42.600
Look, top right.

00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:44.120
There's a dragon.

00:47:47.840 --> 00:47:48.880
Every time you tell me to look,

00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:49.640
I do.

00:47:49.640 --> 00:47:50.400
But when I tell you,

00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:51.480
you never fall for it.

00:47:52.320 --> 00:47:52.920
Boring.
