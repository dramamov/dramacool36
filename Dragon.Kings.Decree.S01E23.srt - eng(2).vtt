=Dragon King's Decree=

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.000
=Episode 23=

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.230
(Dragon King's Decree)

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:06.890
This is incredibly precious.

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:08.530
Why give it to me?

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.530
My mother stole Miss Yue's identity.

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:16.280
Everything we had was never ours
to begin with.

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.450
You're her daughter.

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:21.280
You have every right to see it.

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:23.450
This isn't the real decree.

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.330
It's only a record about it.

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:28.690
It describes the old days,

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:30.810
when Wujing's ancestors fought dragons

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:31.850
and even married them.

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.610
As for why dragons married women
of the Wujing Saintess' bloodline,

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.210
and the decree's secrets...

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.650
Maybe the answers are in here.

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.370
(Storm and thunder, )

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:51.610
(master of all.)

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:53.250
(Swimming like a fish, )

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:54.970
(flying like a bird.)

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.050
(Walking the earth the way we do.)

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:59.090
(Dragons rule all beasts.)

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:00.290
(The pinnacle of all creatures.)

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:01.570
(A god among them.)

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.290
(The Dragon King leads the sanctuary.)

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:05.370
(Wujing of the mortal realm)

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.770
(and beasts of other realms bow to him.)

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:10.090
(The Wujing Saintess)

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:11.370
(is born blessed)

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:12.930
(and sees what others miss.)

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.010
(When demons invade the mortal realm, )

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.130
(she dons a battle robe and gold armor.)

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.050
(With a crown and jade belt, )

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:21.770
(and the Icebound Sword in hand, )

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:22.930
(she rides dragons)

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.130
(and fights demons.)

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:25.690
(She is fearless.)

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.570
(She forged a blood pact with dragons.)

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:31.170
(That's why her bloodline is so strong.)

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:34.730
(If a dragon marries a woman
of the Wujing Saintess' bloodline, )

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:37.050
(their child is half-dragon.)

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:38.530
(They're born powerful)

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:40.890
(and are fiercely protective.)

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.050
(A clear sign of pregnancy)

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.050
(is a red dragon mark)

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:48.290
(right below the belly button.)

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:51.330
Miss,

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:52.730
it says here

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.690
that dragon eggs
take three years and six months.

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:57.530
So when it's born,

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.370
will it be a dragon or a human?

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.850
No clue.

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:03.210
It doesn't say.

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.690
Young Master still
doesn't know about the child.

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:12.010
Hunbao,

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:14.290
you can't tell anyone.

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.890
Why not?

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:16.610
Miss,

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:17.730
think about it.

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:19.570
You are the real Wujing Saintess.

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.250
Liluo stole everything from you!

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.650
And now you're carrying a dragon child.

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:25.530
Everyone will believe you now.

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:27.890
You can take back what's yours!

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:34.370
You're always with Fei Yuan.
You pick up nothing good from him.

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:35.690
But you sure copied

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:36.890
his boldness.

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:37.930
No, I didn't!

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:39.610
It's just that Liluo's mess

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:41.970
means you and Young Master
can't be together.

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.170
You've been spacing out a lot lately.

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:47.050
Even I'm getting worried.

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:47.970
You little fool.

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:50.890
I live on the edge every single day.

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:52.650
I can't let this get out.

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:54.050
If the baby

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:56.090
becomes my weakness,

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:58.330
they'd tear me apart.

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:01.010
I didn't think it through.

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:03.810
Honestly, the moment I saw my mother,

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:06.650
I knew I was the Wujing Saintess.

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:08.530
But people always say

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:10.770
that the Wujing Saintess
marrying a dragon

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:12.890
will repair the broken barrier

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:14.210
around the sanctuary.

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:15.530
So why is it

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:16.970
that Chu Moshang and I

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:18.970
are basically already married
in our hearts,

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:20.890
yet the barrier

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:22.170
is still falling apart?

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:26.770
Maybe this book got it wrong?

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:28.730
Maybe

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:31.250
there's another meaning behind it.

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:36.810
We need to find the Young Lord

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:37.930
and talk this through.

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:39.810
Now that Mother and I have reunited,

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:41.250
we need to get her

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:42.490
out of Wujing City fast

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:44.450
before Liluo and Li Yue notice.

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:45.530
Alright.

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:07.490
Feng Zhilou,

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:10.010
you were really hard to track down.

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:11.530
What do you want?

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:13.210
Miss Zhilou,

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:16.370
you're so invested in dragon affairs.

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:18.330
Why not ask me directly?

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:20.970
What good is that dusty book?

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:23.130
No book can beat

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:24.970
an actual dragon's answer,

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:26.890
right?

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:30.530
Anyway,

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:32.770
you're my brother's wife.

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:35.010
No need to act distant.

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:37.050
Here's a small gift.

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:38.250
Take it.

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:41.130
I don't want anything from you.

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:42.930
How's Chu Moshang?

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:47.530
For us dragons,

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:49.930
the highest rank is Dragon King.

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:52.090
Every dragon heir grows up

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:54.490
working toward that goal.

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:56.290
My brother got lucky.

00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:59.970
As the eldest, he became the successor.

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:01.770
But now,

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:04.810
Liluo has the Wujing Saintess'
bloodline,

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:07.050
which is required to be Dragon King.

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:09.290
But with you showing up,

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:11.450
my brother got dragged down

00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:13.010
and wiped out at Feng Manor.

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:15.570
Nice job.

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:19.610
You two are brothers,

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:21.410
but totally different.

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:23.090
He's nothing like you.

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:24.730
You're always blaming others

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:26.130
for your own failures.

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:27.690
Feng Zhilou,

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:29.930
keep talking big.

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:33.090
You're not far from dying anyway.

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:37.930
Oh, yeah.

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:39.970
Dragons

00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:42.130
have plenty of scales to spare.

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:45.170
Don't waste my brother's kindness.

00:07:55.410 --> 00:07:55.970
Miss,

00:07:56.290 --> 00:07:58.050
this carries Young Master's scent.

00:07:58.410 --> 00:07:59.890
It's his dragon scale!

00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:06.890
Miss!

00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:07.970
Miss,

00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:08.970
are you alright?

00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:10.930
Chu Moshang's in trouble.

00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:13.370
We need to go.

00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:17.210
Hunbao,

00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:19.650
you know what to do
if things go bad, right?

00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:21.210
Of course I protect you.

00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:23.530
Listen to me.

00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:26.450
(Dongming)
Take this. Go find Li Yan.

00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:27.730
He'll keep you safe.

00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:29.050
And keep Mother safe

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:30.330
in Wujing City.

00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:31.490
Miss,

00:08:31.530 --> 00:08:32.610
what about you?

00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:34.450
I can take care of myself.

00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:35.650
But if I take you,

00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:37.370
they'll use you against me.

00:08:37.809 --> 00:08:39.450
You and Mother both

00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:41.770
matter most to me.

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:45.610
Feng Zhilou.

00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:47.690
Miss!

00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:50.410
Go!

00:08:54.490 --> 00:08:56.210
Of course it's you again.

00:08:56.290 --> 00:08:56.970
This time,

00:08:57.610 --> 00:08:59.050
where do you think you're running?

00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:00.570
Move.

00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:03.090
Didn't you learn anything last time?

00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:07.570
Without the prince backing you,

00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:08.810
what are you?

00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:11.570
How dare you yell at me!

00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:13.010
I may be nothing,

00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:15.250
but you're still trash.

00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:16.050
Today,

00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:19.250
you die here in Wujing!

00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:44.330
You can absorb energy?

00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:45.210
What?

00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:47.970
How else do you think
I hold my ground here?

00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:49.090
Stop putting on an act.

00:09:56.770 --> 00:09:58.730
Let's see how long you last!

00:10:04.210 --> 00:10:05.970
(My baby's protecting me.)

00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:28.250
How do you have the Fire Phoenix flame?

00:10:28.570 --> 00:10:30.370
Only a War God Constitution

00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:32.010
can wield that!

00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:33.810
Who says I'm not one?

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:55.220
(Dongming Hall)

00:10:57.810 --> 00:10:58.650
Xiaoyu,

00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:00.170
do you know?

00:11:01.090 --> 00:11:02.410
If I tell everyone the truth

00:11:02.890 --> 00:11:04.170
at the ceremony,

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:06.810
I'm done for too.

00:11:07.810 --> 00:11:10.090
I was never meant to be Young Lord.

00:11:12.610 --> 00:11:14.010
I'm just too soft.

00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:16.810
I should've stopped
Mother and Liluo sooner.

00:11:17.650 --> 00:11:18.890
Then you wouldn't have died.

00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:22.810
(You did good.)

00:11:23.290 --> 00:11:25.450
(If you hadn't been holding
Wujing together, )

00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:28.560
(with City Lord and Princess Liluo
wasting everything, )

00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:29.930
(Wujing)

00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:32.010
(would've fallen apart long ago.)

00:11:33.850 --> 00:11:35.250
Li Yan!

00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:37.490
Hunbao,

00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:38.650
why are you here?

00:11:38.650 --> 00:11:39.810
Please help Zhilou!

00:11:39.970 --> 00:11:41.570
Liluo sent Dark Dhuta after her!

00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:42.410
Hurry!

00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:46.370
Even your clothes don't want
to go down with you.

00:11:46.810 --> 00:11:47.610
Talk about bad luck.

00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:51.730
Chu Moshang,

00:11:52.050 --> 00:11:53.050
why are you back?

00:11:55.370 --> 00:11:56.570
What happened to you?

00:11:56.810 --> 00:11:58.050
I sensed you two

00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:00.250
were in danger.

00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:03.170
Sorry I got here late.

00:12:03.930 --> 00:12:04.610
Moshang,

00:12:04.850 --> 00:12:06.530
how are you this easy to fool?

00:12:07.010 --> 00:12:08.010
See?

00:12:08.410 --> 00:12:11.130
When things were fine,
why make yourself vulnerable?

00:12:11.570 --> 00:12:12.890
You even lost the dragon pearl.

00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:16.090
And you still broke
the barrier to come out?

00:12:16.170 --> 00:12:18.050
Bet that hurt like hell.

00:12:19.490 --> 00:12:20.690
What did you do to him?

00:12:21.210 --> 00:12:22.650
What did we do?

00:12:23.450 --> 00:12:26.530
He burned all his Dragon God power
just to see you.

00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:28.050
Right now,

00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:29.730
he's a useless dragon.

00:12:30.210 --> 00:12:31.010
So tell me.

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:33.370
Who do you think ruined him?

00:12:33.770 --> 00:12:36.810
We need to go to Canglong Pavilion.
I've got no pearl and no power.

00:12:37.050 --> 00:12:38.370
We can't beat Nie Rongzhi.

00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:49.530
With Dark Dhuta's strength,

00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:51.530
Feng Zhilou should be dead
or close to it.

00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:52.490
What's going on?

00:12:53.450 --> 00:12:54.530
Don't bother looking.

00:12:54.690 --> 00:12:55.650
Your attendant

00:12:56.010 --> 00:12:57.170
is already dust.

00:12:57.610 --> 00:12:59.370
Where's Feng Zhilou?

00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:00.930
Her?

00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:05.090
She ran off with Moshang.

00:13:06.050 --> 00:13:09.210
Wasn't your brother locked up?

00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:11.730
My brother

00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:13.570
actually broke through the barrier

00:13:14.650 --> 00:13:17.050
like a madman to save her.

00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:18.410
Ridiculous.

00:13:18.730 --> 00:13:20.050
Go tell His Majesty

00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:21.850
I said

00:13:22.130 --> 00:13:24.610
if the prince doesn't show
at the wedding,

00:13:25.210 --> 00:13:26.850
whoever does show up

00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:28.210
will

00:13:28.450 --> 00:13:30.130
be the next Dragon King.

00:13:38.530 --> 00:13:40.290
The higher the hope,

00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:42.290
the harder the fall.

00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:44.850
My brother ditched you.

00:13:45.610 --> 00:13:48.530
Now you know who to pick, right?

00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:54.370
Chu Moshang and Feng Zhilou aren't dead.

00:13:54.570 --> 00:13:55.930
Why panic?

00:13:58.090 --> 00:13:59.130
Relax.

00:14:00.250 --> 00:14:01.570
I'll find them.

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:03.730
I'll bring gifts when I see you.

00:14:04.570 --> 00:14:05.450
By then,

00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:07.770
don't disappoint me.

00:14:15.890 --> 00:14:17.770
You just can't stand
seeing your sister suffer.

00:14:17.930 --> 00:14:19.690
And you don't want to lose your title.

00:14:19.930 --> 00:14:21.490
Let me go bite Liluo to death!

00:14:21.650 --> 00:14:22.930
That'd solve everything!

00:14:24.370 --> 00:14:25.050
Hunbao,

00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:28.570
if you kill Liluo,
you're killing the Wujing Saintess too.

00:14:29.250 --> 00:14:30.530
Even if she's fake,

00:14:30.770 --> 00:14:32.130
the Dragon King won't spare you.

00:14:32.690 --> 00:14:35.050
Even if we explain
about Liluo and Mother,

00:14:35.490 --> 00:14:36.770
they'll just think

00:14:37.650 --> 00:14:39.530
we're covering for Feng Zhilou

00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:41.290
and the prince.

00:14:41.530 --> 00:14:42.690
The Wujing Saintess?

00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:44.450
What is she really?

00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:46.290
Would demons from the nether realm

00:14:46.290 --> 00:14:47.690
really fear someone

00:14:47.690 --> 00:14:48.890
as selfish as Liluo?

00:14:49.930 --> 00:14:51.170
Exactly, Hunbao.

00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:53.610
Feng Zhilou is the real Wujing Saintess.

00:14:54.250 --> 00:14:55.650
So her marrying the Dragon...

00:14:56.970 --> 00:14:58.530
What does that even mean?

00:14:59.010 --> 00:15:00.130
If even humans and dragons

00:15:00.130 --> 00:15:01.570
can't figure it out,

00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:02.890
why ask a snake?

00:15:03.730 --> 00:15:04.090
Hey.

00:15:04.410 --> 00:15:04.930
Hey!

00:15:06.930 --> 00:15:07.170
Hey!

00:15:07.530 --> 00:15:07.810
Hey!

00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:10.130
I'm a snake.

00:15:10.170 --> 00:15:11.930
If I bite you,
you're as good as poisoned.

00:15:12.970 --> 00:15:14.130
I was born toxic.

00:15:14.130 --> 00:15:15.210
You can't blame me for that.

00:15:18.650 --> 00:15:20.330
Xiaoyu,

00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:21.970
get out here and save him!

00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:32.430
(Dongming Hall)

00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:50.970
Xiaoyu,

00:15:51.490 --> 00:15:52.410
is it really you?

00:16:10.770 --> 00:16:12.890
She barely made it.

00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:14.490
If Zhilou wasn't so skilled,

00:16:14.490 --> 00:16:15.610
she wouldn't have been saved.

00:16:15.930 --> 00:16:18.570
We faked her death
so she could escape Wujing City Lord

00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:19.730
and Liluo's control.

00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:22.250
You're lucky it worked out this well.

00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:27.370
Zhilou planned everything.

00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:29.370
I have no idea how she's doing now.

00:16:30.290 --> 00:16:32.130
How are they supposed
to return in three days?

00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:45.330
Without your dragon pearl,

00:16:45.730 --> 00:16:47.170
aren't you completely defenseless?

00:16:47.690 --> 00:16:48.330
Relax.

00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:50.490
I'll ask Father

00:16:50.770 --> 00:16:51.610
for it back.

00:16:51.810 --> 00:16:53.010
But you gave up

00:16:53.370 --> 00:16:54.570
the Dragon King throne.

00:16:55.130 --> 00:16:56.290
Won't you regret that?

00:16:56.490 --> 00:16:58.290
I never wanted the throne.

00:17:04.010 --> 00:17:04.890
Right now,

00:17:05.290 --> 00:17:06.010
I already

00:17:06.010 --> 00:17:07.730
have something I never dreamed I'd have.

00:17:14.569 --> 00:17:15.650
I totally forgot

00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:18.410
dragons don't eat human food.

00:17:18.730 --> 00:17:20.410
We live off spirit.

00:17:20.770 --> 00:17:21.770
Thinking back,

00:17:22.690 --> 00:17:24.089
ever since we slept together,

00:17:24.970 --> 00:17:26.569
you stopped wanting food.

00:17:30.170 --> 00:17:31.210
I thought it was

00:17:31.410 --> 00:17:32.930
just my bad mood,

00:17:33.090 --> 00:17:34.410
so I lost my appetite.

00:17:35.370 --> 00:17:38.850
The Dragon King's Decree says
once you're pregnant with a dragon child,

00:17:39.650 --> 00:17:42.050
it feeds off your energy

00:17:42.650 --> 00:17:43.410
until it's born.

00:17:44.770 --> 00:17:45.610
Chu Moshang,

00:17:46.530 --> 00:17:47.450
tell me.

00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:49.290
With me like this,

00:17:50.050 --> 00:17:51.050
will I only get

00:17:51.050 --> 00:17:52.570
three and a half years with you?

00:17:52.850 --> 00:17:54.490
Pregnancy isn't just your burden.

00:17:55.690 --> 00:17:56.930
I'll give you spirit.

00:17:57.370 --> 00:17:58.130
But

00:17:58.570 --> 00:18:00.010
this sanctuary's barrier

00:18:00.010 --> 00:18:01.210
won't last long.

00:18:02.050 --> 00:18:04.010
Nie Rongzhi could break it at any time.

00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:05.930
If he does, we both die.

00:18:06.170 --> 00:18:07.090
Then what do we do?

00:18:26.370 --> 00:18:27.930
Remember this.

00:18:30.050 --> 00:18:30.810
Hold on to this.

00:18:31.770 --> 00:18:32.570
Go back home.

00:18:33.410 --> 00:18:34.930
Protect yourself and the baby.

00:18:35.130 --> 00:18:35.930
Don't worry.

00:18:36.730 --> 00:18:38.050
I'll find you.

00:18:38.770 --> 00:18:39.410
(Shang,)

00:18:39.850 --> 00:18:42.770
(the barrier won't protect you for long.)

00:18:43.050 --> 00:18:45.490
(Without the dragon pearl,
you're useless.)

00:18:45.970 --> 00:18:47.490
(Be smart and come out.)

00:18:48.090 --> 00:18:50.170
(If I tear this place apart,)

00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:53.090
(neither of you will survive!)

00:18:57.130 --> 00:18:58.450
When I count to three,

00:18:59.010 --> 00:19:00.770
I'll make my move.

00:19:03.370 --> 00:19:04.410
Three...

00:19:14.810 --> 00:19:20.360
♪Like petals fall, gone with the clouds♪

00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:26.260
♪Like stars fade fast in open skies♪

00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:32.140
♪Like snowflakes melting softly
in the evening haze♪

00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:38.430
♪Like your fleeting glance
that gave me one brief dream's grace♪

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:44.330
♪Like fireflies flicker
through wild grass, fleeting light♪

00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:50.070
♪Like evening breeze
that stirs soft hair in twilight♪

00:19:50.670 --> 00:19:56.190
♪Like fleeting thoughts
that surge and then unwind♪

00:19:56.390 --> 00:20:02.330
♪Chance meetings fade,
just empty rooms left behind♪

00:20:02.330 --> 00:20:07.640
♪You brought a wave
that stirred a wild, restless sea♪

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:13.820
♪Light as a feather,
yet it sank an island deep in me♪

00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:20.560
♪In that one moment,
life's grip I couldn't break or sway♪

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:26.320
♪Leaving me lost in memories,
small and fading away♪
