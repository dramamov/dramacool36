Go downstairs in five minutes.

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:19.580
Let's have a drink.

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:33.540
Hello, Yan.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.730
You're back.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.850
Ms. Wen,

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:39.140
where's my dad?

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:40.810
I thought he had come home.

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:42.900
He won't have dinner with us today.

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:43.780
Says there's a gathering.

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:46.410
With whom?

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.100
Should be his university classmates.

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:50.980
Did he solve his winery's problem?

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:52.780
It should be solved.

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:56.370
Le,

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.140
you may practice your piano now.

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:02.460
You'll do your homework after dinner.

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.930
Sure.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:03.660
Alright?

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.660
Grandma,

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.250
I'm not going
to the tutoring center again?

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.900
You're about to start middle school,

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.170
and your schedule will be tight.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:15.250
Let's stop for now.

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:18.900
But what if my piano skills get worse?

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:21.100
You have me.

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.410
I'll give you private lessons at home.

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:24.900
So we save the time spent commuting.

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:25.810
More efficient and time-saving.

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:27.100
Exactly.

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:29.250
You have got Ms. Wen.

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:30.340
Right.

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:30.900
I'll clean my hands.

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:46.020
You're here!

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:54.680

Group hug!

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:57.900
And me.

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:02.460
Duo, our class beauty.

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:03.340
Can't recognize her?

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:04.370
The gorgeous Duo!

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:05.660
Everyone's finally here!

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:06.780
How long has it been?

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:07.900
- Over a decade.
- More than a decade.

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:08.460
Must be around eighteen.

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:09.250
Yeah, about that.

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:10.660
Time flies!

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:11.250
Everyone's here!

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:12.340
Remember?

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:12.780
Liu!

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:15.580
Right?

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:16.140
Only me?

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:17.250
We were waiting for you.

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:18.140
We were waiting for you.

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:19.460
Sorry, I had some trouble,

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:21.140
but I brought wine.

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:22.370
Yeah. That settles it then.

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.040
This is your seat.

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:26.160
Sit down.

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:27.920
Go on, sit first.

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:34.250
Sit down.

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:40.140
Let's raise our glasses

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:41.850
and do a toast!

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:45.460
We've finally got everyone together.

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:47.700
First, thank three

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:50.900
of the Four Golden Flowers

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:52.340
who organized this gathering.

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:53.580
One of them was late.

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:54.460
So sorry.

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:54.900
Secondly,

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.020
thank the Aerospace Academy.

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:59.140
Without our alma mater,

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:00.660
we wouldn't sit together like this,

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:01.250
right?

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:01.540
Right.

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:01.900
Right?

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:03.340
And last but not least,

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:07.020
wish you success
in your respective fields.

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:07.700
How about that?

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:09.140
Come on.

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:10.780
Come on.

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:11.020
Come on.

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.020
To our youth! Cheers!

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:13.340
Great!

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:14.220
Cheers!

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:15.900
No rush. Let's drink slowly.

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:18.140
It's been long
since I've had this much fun.

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:19.780
Rui,

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:21.460
as a young entrepreneur

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:22.490
working for yourself,

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:24.340
why did you show up later

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:25.100
than us salaried employees?

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:26.780
Punish yourself with a few drinks.

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:27.140
Yeah.

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:28.250
Take a penalty drink.

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:29.700
I was late. Here goes.

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:31.610
I've got a few words for you.

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:33.140
You're not available every time.

00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:34.660
Without this gathering,

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:35.660
it would've been tough

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:36.900
to ask you out.

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:37.780
No way.

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:38.700
Honestly,

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:40.140
after all these years of working,

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:41.660
it's clear in my head now.

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:43.250
We're just a bunch

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:44.660
of corporate slaves.

00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:47.020
Regardless of our profession,

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:48.780
we have to be on call 24/7.

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:50.020
In today's society,

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:51.780
the competition is getting fiercer.

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:53.730
At home,

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:54.660
our wives have

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:56.140
to manage everything.

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:58.250
Actually, women have it the hardest.

00:07:58.920 --> 00:07:59.900
You guys

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:01.780
should cherish your wives.

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:03.370
Do you hear that?

00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:04.020
That's a must!

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:04.490
I'm talking to you!

00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:05.660
Let's toast to women in our class.

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:06.140
Come on.

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:07.170
Thanks!

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:08.850
Classmates,

00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:09.850
let's do

00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:11.020
another toast.

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:12.850
Everyone, come on.

00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:14.050
Together, everyone!

00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:17.850
The view here is really nice.

00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:20.660
Sitting here,

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:21.610
after a busy day,

00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:23.050
all my worries

00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:25.370
can fade away.

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:26.930
Of course.

00:08:27.390 --> 00:08:28.850
It's a prime location.

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:30.930
Come on, Ting.

00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:32.060
Let me show you.

00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:33.850
Come.

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:37.730
See over there?

00:08:37.910 --> 00:08:38.700
That shopping mall.

00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:40.060
That's

00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:42.420
where I used to work.

00:08:43.550 --> 00:08:45.980
I was a sales assistant in a shoe store.

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:48.180
Every day, I'd say to customers,

00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:49.130
"Hello,

00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:52.010
welcome! Please sit.
I'll help you try them on."

00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:54.490
Every day after work,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.610
I saw the tall building
across the street,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.890
the very place where I live now.

00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:00.130
Back then,

00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:01.820
many of my customers lived here.

00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:03.650
When they bought shoes,

00:09:04.270 --> 00:09:06.370
they'd tell me
their community was high-end,

00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:08.250
the property management
was professional,

00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:09.730
and how beautiful the landscaping was.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.890
So when Yuan offered to buy me a place.

00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:15.490
I told him without hesitation,

00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:17.490
I want to live here.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:19.730
Congratulations

00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:21.370
on fulfilling your wish.

00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:22.180
Thank you.

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:27.770
But after I moved in,

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:30.010
for a few times,

00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:32.490
I ran into my former customers
in the elevator,

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:34.890
and they didn't even recognize me.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:36.490
Then again,

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:38.180
nobody remembers the person

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:39.770
who fetched shoes for them,

00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:40.420
right?

00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:43.300
But I remember very clearly

00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:45.130
their attitudes,

00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:47.980
the clothes they were in

00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:50.060
and the perfume they wore.

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:54.250
It's great they didn't recognize me.

00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:55.580
What does that prove?

00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:56.250
It proves

00:09:57.750 --> 00:09:58.980
I've transformed successfully.

00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:00.530
Well, alright.

00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:01.730
Can I say otherwise?

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:02.890
Come on.

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:03.890
To celebrate having

00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:05.180
such a good little brother.

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:06.890
Yuan is indeed great.

00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:10.130
This whole process of brewing…

00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:11.250
Or getting into international business.

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:11.980
You know,

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.130
I really love this.

00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:14.650
It's like half of my dream.

00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:16.490
Want to see?

00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:18.730
Si,

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.300
new materials.

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:21.420
If this works out...

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:22.650
Pressure suits.

00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:23.770
Amazing!

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:25.770
In the times we live in,

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:27.650
whoever falls behind will get beaten.

00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:29.250
So you have to give it your all.

00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:30.530
In the future,

00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:32.180
man will migrate to space stations.

00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:32.610
Right!

00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:33.650
And migrate to Mars!

00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:35.130
For our nation's dream
of space exploration!

00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:36.010
Space is a journey we must undertake.

00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:37.370
To spill our blood and devote ourselves

00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:38.850
without hesitation!

00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:41.010
Toast to that without hesitation.

00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:41.770
Come on, for immediate success.

00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:42.530
Come on, Feng Rui!

00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:43.610
Come on.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.250
I have to thank Rui.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.530
If he hadn't turned it down back

00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:48.250
when we graduated,

00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:50.490
I wouldn't have got
that hospital position.

00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:51.130
Don't.

00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:51.980
Who knows

00:10:52.270 --> 00:10:53.610
where I'd have worked now?

00:10:53.630 --> 00:10:54.250
No.

00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:55.580
Don't get into all this thanking.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.700
What's meant to be yours will be yours.

00:10:58.630 --> 00:10:59.010
Had nothing to do with me.

00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:00.420
This might not be a big deal for you,

00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:01.730
but

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.130
I can't forget this kindness,

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:04.850
right?

00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:05.130
Right.

00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:06.180
Don't.

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:06.610
Come on.

00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:06.890
Bottoms up.

00:11:07.510 --> 00:11:07.980
Finish it.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:08.370
Go on!

00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:09.850
I'm draining my glass.

00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:10.250
Take your time.

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:17.010
But...

00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:18.010
Yeah.

00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:19.700
But then again,

00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:21.890
he's got it the easiest.

00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:23.060
He's his own boss.

00:11:23.270 --> 00:11:23.770
Free.

00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:24.730
That's better than us.

00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:25.490
Well,

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:27.650
let's switch.

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:28.340
Go back to how it was.

00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:29.300
You live my life,

00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:30.060
and I'll live yours.

00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:31.130
Works for me.

00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:35.370
Stop joking, Feng Rui.

00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:36.980
With a big company

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:39.010
and a large family business,

00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:40.770
now you can do

00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:42.010
whatever you desire.

00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:43.010
How great!

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:53.820
Here's the thing,

00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:55.770
Feng Rui

00:11:55.790 --> 00:11:58.300
wouldn't have given up his space dream.

00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:01.220
But back then, his grandfather's

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:02.460
health was failing,

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:03.340
so he...

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:05.100
You have to remember,

00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:08.220
he was a scholarship winner every year.

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:09.180
That's right.

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:09.700
A top student.

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:11.300
Definitely a top student.

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:13.820
So, you don't know me.

00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:16.700
That my space dream

00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:17.980
was just wishful thinking.

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:22.820
I was born for business.

00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:24.420
I love doing business.

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:32.770
Well.

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:33.770
Come on.

00:12:34.630 --> 00:12:35.180
Feng Rui,

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:35.700
then

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:38.650
I wish you great success!

00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:39.010
Please give me some.

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:39.340
Alright.

00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:40.300
Come on!

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:41.220
Let's cheers!

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:42.300
Come on.

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:42.770
Raise your glasses!

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:43.460
Come on.

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:44.220
Feng Rui!

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:44.820
To your great success!

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:45.580
Come on.

00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:51.850
Ting,

00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:53.730
do you think wine is a good thing?

00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:56.890
What else is bothering you?

00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:03.370
I don't know what it is.

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:05.890
Let me tell you.

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:07.890
Back when I was young,

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:09.850
all I wanted was to be rich.

00:13:10.910 --> 00:13:12.850
I thought being rich was great,

00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:14.850
so I could buy

00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:15.770
any trendy bag I wanted,

00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:17.770
travel wherever I felt like,

00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:20.010
and date whoever I pleased.

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:23.130
But now that I'm rich,

00:13:23.510 --> 00:13:26.100
I suddenly feel life is meaningless.

00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:29.420
During the years you were abroad,

00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:33.130
I haven't had a true friend by my side.

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:40.010
Have you thought about working?

00:13:43.510 --> 00:13:44.300
What could I do?

00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:47.250
Tell me what I can do.

00:13:47.510 --> 00:13:48.770
I've gained weight
since I stopped dancing.

00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:50.370
Not 5 kg, but 10 kg.

00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:52.610
Look, I don't have a degree,

00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:54.100
and I'm not skilled at anything.

00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:56.530
To be a saleswoman again?

00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:57.730
No way.

00:13:58.270 --> 00:13:59.010
Over these years,

00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:00.890
I've got used to a comfortable life,

00:14:01.270 --> 00:14:02.370
so I can't handle any hardship.

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:04.610
Yuan was right about one thing.

00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:08.890
I'm ambitious but unskilled.

00:14:16.510 --> 00:14:16.890
Ting,

00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:18.490
as my good friend,

00:14:18.510 --> 00:14:19.490
tell me the truth.

00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:21.770
After all these years abroad,

00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:24.890
you didn't date a boy?

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:26.700
No.

00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:29.890
Not even that?

00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:31.300
No.

00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:31.730
Let's drink.

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:34.370
You've got some willpower.

00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:40.490
Right.

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:42.060
You're

00:14:42.910 --> 00:14:45.490
a successful artist

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:47.370
and career woman.

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:48.890
But let me tell you,

00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:50.980
no matter how beautiful you are,

00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:52.300
how great your figure is,

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:53.460
or how rich you are,

00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:55.010
if you don't get married

00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:56.420
and don't have children,

00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:57.610
in the end,

00:14:57.630 --> 00:14:59.060
you'll be lonely
and uncared for in old age.

00:14:59.080 --> 00:14:59.700
Do you know that?

00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:08.820
My child didn't die.

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:11.460
Who didn't die?

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.610
The child I thought dead

00:15:18.270 --> 00:15:19.850
12 years ago, is alive.

00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:22.650
He's been with Feng Rui.

00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:01.100
Feng Rui, you'll marry soon.

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:02.180
What do you feel?

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.340
What's there for me to say?

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:06.060
It's just

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:08.100
what all of you've experienced.

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:10.340
That's completely different, okay?

00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:11.940
Come on.

00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:14.130
Let those of us

00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:15.650
who haven't felt happiness

00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:17.180
in a long time feel your joy.

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:21.340
Wu has been raising

00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:23.340
his child alone all these years,

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:25.610
being both a father and a mother.

00:16:26.670 --> 00:16:27.300
It's been tough.

00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:28.890
We thought he'd

00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:30.650
get married and have kids，

00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:32.220
but suddenly he became a dad.

00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:33.610
Wu,

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:35.490
in this situation,

00:16:35.750 --> 00:16:36.730
you're leading us.

00:16:37.510 --> 00:16:38.490
I'm leading you.

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:39.940
The leader.

00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:40.700
Rui,

00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:41.820
I've always

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:42.980
been curious.

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:44.490
Back then,

00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:48.060
which beauty was so charming

00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:50.460
that she made you

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.940
a father in a short time

00:16:53.750 --> 00:16:54.980
and a single dad?

00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:55.890
Tell us.

00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:57.220
Who was it?

00:16:57.480 --> 00:16:58.180
Yeah, spill it!

00:16:58.200 --> 00:16:59.370
Who was it?

00:16:59.390 --> 00:17:01.730
Hey, don't bring up sensitive things!

00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:02.890
Liu is right.

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:06.570
But the child's mother

00:17:06.750 --> 00:17:07.220
is still around.

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:08.730
She's back.

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:15.220
Who's back?

00:17:16.030 --> 00:17:17.180
How would I know?

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:18.380
Well.

00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:18.730
Look,

00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:21.620
Feng Rui,

00:17:22.790 --> 00:17:24.900
let us know when you get married.

00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:27.010
We're all waiting for that day,

00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:28.050
aren't we?

00:17:28.830 --> 00:17:29.900
We're all waiting for it.

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:35.660
Let me clink glasses with you.

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:36.620
Well.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:37.460
And me.

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:39.050
Let's have a drink.

00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:40.660
Come on!

00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:40.980
You guys...

00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:41.770
Come on.

00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:42.420
Alright.

00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:43.050
You should drink.

00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:44.180
Boss,

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:45.420
let me ask you.

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:46.730
I heard

00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:48.380
some news from NASA again.

00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:49.810
You're right.

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:52.050
All these years, I've been all alone.

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:53.810
For 12 years,

00:17:56.830 --> 00:17:58.980
it was work and more work every day.

00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:02.730
You know my father's situation.

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:05.980
Not a single piece of news.

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:08.380
To put it bluntly,

00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:10.460
we don't know if he's alive or not.

00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:12.250
But when I found out

00:18:12.270 --> 00:18:13.660
Le was my son,

00:18:14.830 --> 00:18:15.620
I felt like

00:18:16.510 --> 00:18:17.220
I wasn't alone anymore.

00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:19.980
I didn't feel so lonely.

00:18:20.110 --> 00:18:21.290
I felt my life had

00:18:22.030 --> 00:18:23.010
a continuation.

00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:28.220
But you know what Gao Hui told me?

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:34.460

I've missed many moments

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:47.900
when he was suffering like that.

00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:50.660
For these 12 years,

00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:52.010
mom has always

00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:54.460
been a void in Le's heart.

00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:56.460
He must have asked himself...

00:18:58.680 --> 00:18:59.460
countless times

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:01.180
why other kids have a mom,

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:01.900
but he doesn't.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:05.730
I hate Gao Hui.

00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:07.620
From the very beginning,

00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:09.290
she stripped me
of my right to be a mother.

00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:12.730
I also hate Feng Rui.

00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:17.010
All these years...

00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:21.660
he deceived me with Gao Hui.

00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:22.980
He didn't even call me once.

00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:27.090
I also hate myself.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.860
I should have seen it

00:19:33.030 --> 00:19:33.810
with my own eyes back then.

00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:36.490
Whether the child was alive or dead,

00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:39.620
if I had insisted on seeing him,

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:41.290
would things have been different now?

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:46.180
If I tell Le I'm his mother now,

00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:47.900
will he hate me?

00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:50.770
Siting,

00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:53.980
how is the child doing now?

00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:57.730
He's doing very well.

00:20:00.510 --> 00:20:02.050
You can tell Le is happy

00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:02.900
and joyful.

Gao Hui and Feng Rui

must be treating him very well.

over these years,

We need to know their real intentions.

00:25:57.580 --> 00:25:58.580
As you've seen,

00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:00.860
the company is in a tough situation.

00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:02.500
There's no one reliable to send.

00:26:02.780 --> 00:26:03.780
I'm busy

00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:04.820

Don't worry.

00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:18.180
I'll ask Ms. Ming from our home

00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:19.540
to take care of her.

00:26:21.540 --> 00:26:22.140
After all,

00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:24.820
she's carrying our family's heir.

00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:26.820
I know

00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:28.540
what to do.

00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:31.860
At first,

00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:34.820
nobody knew about red wine.

00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:35.860
It was a new thing.

00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:38.980
At that time, your grandma

00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:40.900
was pregnant with your mom.

00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:43.860
It was over 30 degrees Celsius.

00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:45.780
We sold

00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:47.340
door-to-door

00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:48.820
from small grocery stores

00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:50.700
to small supermarkets.

00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:52.900
If we hadn't persevered back then,

00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:54.020
we might have been done for long ago.

00:26:54.860 --> 00:26:56.300
Now is the hardest time.

00:26:57.060 --> 00:26:59.100
We must persevere.

00:27:00.100 --> 00:27:01.300
Help your mom.

00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:04.780
This is the life's work
of three generations of our family.

00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:06.620
Can't

00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:08.580
let it collapse like this.

00:27:11.620 --> 00:27:12.460
Grandpa, don't worry.

00:27:16.180 --> 00:27:16.900
The company won't collapse.

00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:39.460
Let's eat.

00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:39.980
Okay.

00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:46.460
How does it taste?

00:27:48.820 --> 00:27:49.140
Not bad.

00:27:56.420 --> 00:27:57.300
Have something to say?

00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:02.580
I

00:28:03.460 --> 00:28:04.860
may go abroad in a while.

00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:06.340
Because

00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:09.060
I can't get in touch
with the company overseas.

00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:11.580
So we need to talk to them face-to-face.

00:28:12.420 --> 00:28:13.620
Or my company will be in danger.

00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:15.940
How long will it take?

00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:18.020
At most a week.

00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:23.900
I promise it'll be exactly one week.

00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:25.860
During this time,

00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:27.420
Ms. Ming will come over

00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:28.140
to cook for you.

00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:31.380
She's worked for our family
for a long time,

00:28:32.060 --> 00:28:32.820
and her cooking is delicious.

00:28:34.740 --> 00:28:35.180
No need.

00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:37.020
I can take care of myself.

00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:38.060
That won't do.

00:28:39.020 --> 00:28:39.580
You're

00:28:39.820 --> 00:28:41.060
the treasure of our family now.

00:28:42.980 --> 00:28:44.220
After I finish my work,

00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:45.500
I'll take care of the cooking.

00:28:47.780 --> 00:28:49.020
So, are you saying

00:28:49.660 --> 00:28:50.660
the treasure should do the dishes?

00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:53.460
Of course not.

00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:54.580
Doing the dishes

00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:55.660
is also my job.

00:28:58.500 --> 00:28:59.900
Then I'm really blessed.

00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:02.820
You will cook
and wash dishes for me.

00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:06.260
It's

00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:08.020
my blessing.

00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:09.260
Others would love to cook,

00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:09.820
but no one would taste.

00:29:17.540 --> 00:29:18.580
Do you still have this?

00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:23.580
Always keep it close.

00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:26.380
When you go abroad,

00:29:27.060 --> 00:29:28.020
keep it safe.

00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:30.620
I believe,

00:29:31.580 --> 00:29:32.260
with this,

00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:33.740
everything will go smoothly.

00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:35.300
Right?

00:29:36.460 --> 00:29:36.620
Yes.

00:29:38.740 --> 00:29:39.100
Eat up.

00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:41.860
Let me taste this.

00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:50.340
Mr. Feng, what do you think
of this contract?

00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:51.780
According to our inventory count,

00:29:52.340 --> 00:29:54.940
it's mainly about introducing
six types of French wine.

00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:05.420
Yes, that's right.

00:30:05.420 --> 00:30:06.740
Mr. Li is quite something.

00:30:06.940 --> 00:30:08.220
Mr. Feng is knowledgeable.

00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:09.620
Please call me Rui.

00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:11.100
Given our relationship.

00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:12.500
We developed

00:30:12.620 --> 00:30:14.300
this wine at our winery.

00:30:14.340 --> 00:30:14.860
Let's push for it.

00:30:14.860 --> 00:30:16.060
If that doesn't work, ten percent

00:30:16.060 --> 00:30:16.620
and then five percent.

00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:17.700
It's a dry red made

00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:18.660
from the selected pearl grape.

00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:20.900
We've spent so much on marketing costs,

00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:22.460
but our sales performance

00:30:22.460 --> 00:30:23.260
hasn't improved.

00:30:23.380 --> 00:30:24.460
Thanks for showing respect to us.

00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:25.060
Cheers.

00:30:25.060 --> 00:30:25.660
Come on.

00:30:26.540 --> 00:30:27.660
Actually, we have some products...

00:30:27.780 --> 00:30:28.820
Thank you for your trust.

00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:29.580
No.

00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:31.140
Please give me a chance.

00:30:31.860 --> 00:30:32.180
No.

00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:34.180
We can handle this very well.

00:30:34.620 --> 00:30:36.780
We can't take this risk.

00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:42.540
It was low last year.

00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:43.020
For this year,

00:30:43.020 --> 00:30:43.900
there's no way it can be low again.

00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:44.820
We have to improve it.

00:30:44.820 --> 00:30:45.380
So, do you have

00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:46.820
a new marketing plan?

00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:52.340
Hello.

00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:53.620
Hello, Mr. Feng.

00:30:53.620 --> 00:30:54.580
I'm David.

00:30:56.060 --> 00:30:56.660
Hi, David.

00:30:57.860 --> 00:30:59.140
I have good news for you.

00:30:59.340 --> 00:31:01.540
We've agreed to your proposal

00:31:01.540 --> 00:31:02.860
and would like to work with you.

00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:05.060
Please come and sign the contract.

00:31:06.180 --> 00:31:06.700
Really?

00:31:07.260 --> 00:31:07.660
Yes.

00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:09.060
That's great!

00:31:09.540 --> 00:31:10.500
I'll come over.

00:31:10.620 --> 00:31:10.940
Yes.

00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:11.580

00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:22.260

By the way,

00:31:36.260 --> 00:31:37.700
does Ms. Ming's cooking suit your taste?

00:31:39.100 --> 00:31:39.860
It's pretty good.

00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:41.180

00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:41.740
Bye-bye.

00:32:28.340 --> 00:32:29.060
I'll walk you in.

00:32:32.140 --> 00:32:32.580
I can do it.

00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:33.100
It's okay.

00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:37.900
Be careful on your way.

00:32:45.220 --> 00:32:45.620
Bye.

00:33:03.340 --> 00:33:04.820
Although Le doesn't have a mother,

00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:06.940
what he lacks the least

00:33:07.620 --> 00:33:08.460
is love.

00:33:11.300 --> 00:33:12.580
Yan's given him

00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:16.100
the maternal love he was missing.

00:33:18.220 --> 00:33:19.380
She taught him piano

00:33:20.220 --> 00:33:21.900
and took care of his daily life.

00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:23.820
For all these years,

00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:26.420
it has never stopped.

00:33:31.900 --> 00:33:33.420
During pregnancy,

00:33:33.420 --> 00:33:35.860
a woman's hormone levels are imbalanced.

00:33:35.940 --> 00:33:37.620
The challenges she may face

00:33:37.620 --> 00:33:39.820
can be unsolvable at this stage.

00:33:40.340 --> 00:33:42.580
It might lead to significant mental stress,

00:33:42.820 --> 00:33:46.020
anxiety, insomnia,
mood swings, frequent crying,

00:33:46.780 --> 00:33:47.540
and slow reactions.

00:33:47.820 --> 00:33:49.980
These are clear signs
of prenatal depression.

00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:52.020
Never underestimate it.

00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:53.620
If not handled properly,

00:33:53.940 --> 00:33:55.500
there may be severe consequences.

00:33:55.740 --> 00:33:56.220
Thanks.

00:34:02.540 --> 00:34:03.940
I may go abroad in a while.

00:34:05.420 --> 00:34:06.060
How long will it take?

00:34:08.620 --> 00:34:09.460
At most a week.

00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:14.780
I promise it'll be exactly one week.

00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:09.060
Ms. Tan,

00:35:10.540 --> 00:35:11.180
are you okay?

00:35:28.580 --> 00:35:29.700
When are you coming back?

00:35:30.940 --> 00:35:32.420
It might take another two weeks.

00:35:33.980 --> 00:35:35.460
You've been gone for over 20 days.

00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:38.100
I know.

00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:39.140
It's almost over.

00:35:39.620 --> 00:35:40.340
At most half a month.

00:35:40.340 --> 00:35:41.180
I'll be back this time.

00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:46.900
Does Ms. Ming's cooking suit your taste?

00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:48.100
It's pretty good.

00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:50.420
That's great.

00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:53.460
Going into the elevator now,
might lose signal.

00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:56.340
I'll hang up.

00:35:56.860 --> 00:35:57.380
Bye-bye.

00:36:46.260 --> 00:36:47.060
Hello, Shuhan.

00:36:47.900 --> 00:36:49.380
Wait for me there.

00:36:49.700 --> 00:36:51.300
I'm tidying up now.

00:36:52.300 --> 00:36:53.420
Leaving soon, very soon.

00:37:00.420 --> 00:37:00.980
Hello.

00:37:02.060 --> 00:37:02.940
Hello, Shuhan.

00:37:40.660 --> 00:37:41.220
You're awake.

00:37:41.620 --> 00:37:42.300
Do you have a headache?

00:37:43.420 --> 00:37:44.100
Why

00:37:44.580 --> 00:37:45.300
are you up so early?

00:37:47.060 --> 00:37:47.780
I came in the morning

00:37:47.780 --> 00:37:48.820
to make you a hangover soup.

00:37:50.060 --> 00:37:50.380
Here.

00:37:53.740 --> 00:37:54.300
How is it?

00:37:54.940 --> 00:37:55.620
Thoughtful, right?

00:37:57.540 --> 00:37:59.900
I drank too much yesterday.

00:38:00.860 --> 00:38:01.740
Troubled you again.

00:38:02.740 --> 00:38:03.820
Don't say anything.

00:38:04.140 --> 00:38:04.980
Just drink the soup.

00:38:05.180 --> 00:38:06.300
Don't waste my efforts.

00:38:07.420 --> 00:38:07.660
Okay.

00:38:09.980 --> 00:38:10.780
Drinking the hangover soup.

00:38:25.180 --> 00:38:25.660
Le,

00:38:25.780 --> 00:38:26.100
he…

00:38:26.620 --> 00:38:27.260
Last night,

00:38:27.580 --> 00:38:30.140
his grandma knew you'd be back late,

00:38:30.380 --> 00:38:31.980
so she picked him up. Don't worry.

00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:36.260
By the way,

00:38:37.020 --> 00:38:38.500
how's your concert preparation going?

00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:40.660
Going quite smoothly.

00:38:43.060 --> 00:38:43.460
Has it been scheduled?

00:38:43.620 --> 00:38:44.180
When?

00:38:47.180 --> 00:38:48.140
Whenever you want to hear it.

00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:50.060
I'll hold it

00:38:50.060 --> 00:38:51.100
whenever you want.

00:38:54.180 --> 00:38:54.780
Me...

00:38:56.540 --> 00:38:57.820
Once I'm sober,

00:38:58.260 --> 00:38:58.700
we'll decide.

00:39:01.700 --> 00:39:02.500
This time, not bad.

00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:03.620
Add a point.

00:39:03.740 --> 00:39:04.980
Finally, no thank you.

00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:07.540
I haven't decided yet.

00:39:08.180 --> 00:39:08.900
I want

00:39:09.620 --> 00:39:10.660
to pick an auspicious date.

00:39:17.660 --> 00:39:18.580
Enough, that's about it.

00:39:19.940 --> 00:39:20.700
Drink more, finish it.

00:39:21.060 --> 00:39:21.700
Have some more.

00:39:35.580 --> 00:39:38.500
[Cygne]

00:39:44.180 --> 00:39:44.540
Dad,

00:39:44.860 --> 00:39:45.300
what's up?

00:39:45.540 --> 00:39:46.140
Rui,

00:39:46.540 --> 00:39:47.140
are you busy?

00:39:48.540 --> 00:39:49.180
Not really. Go ahead.

00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:51.620
I went to the countryside yesterday

00:39:52.180 --> 00:39:53.140
and met an old friend.

00:39:53.540 --> 00:39:54.500
Do you know who I met?

00:39:54.980 --> 00:39:55.420
Who?

00:39:56.060 --> 00:39:57.020
Do you still remember

00:39:57.980 --> 00:39:59.180
that distant Fifth Uncle?

00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:00.380
Fifth Uncle?

00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:01.740
Of course, I do.

00:40:02.460 --> 00:40:03.660
Hearing you're getting married,

00:40:03.940 --> 00:40:05.180
he was overjoyed.

00:40:05.860 --> 00:40:06.620
So,

00:40:07.420 --> 00:40:08.700
how is his health?

00:40:09.180 --> 00:40:09.820
Not bad.

00:40:10.340 --> 00:40:11.380
He's almost 100 years old.

00:40:13.820 --> 00:40:15.420
How are the wedding preparations going?

00:40:16.420 --> 00:40:17.300
When will you register your marriage?

00:40:18.980 --> 00:40:19.900
Not yet.

00:40:20.820 --> 00:40:21.340
Rui,

00:40:21.660 --> 00:40:22.580
this is a big deal.

00:40:23.540 --> 00:40:24.260
Whatever happened

00:40:25.060 --> 00:40:25.580
in the past,

00:40:26.380 --> 00:40:27.260
it's all over now.

00:40:28.180 --> 00:40:29.700
Cherish the one with you now.

00:40:31.100 --> 00:40:31.620
I know.

00:40:55.900 --> 00:40:56.460
Ms. Tan,

00:40:57.660 --> 00:40:58.540
you really want Yufan to perform

00:40:58.540 --> 00:41:00.180
the bridesmaid variation
from Don Quixote Act I?

00:41:01.180 --> 00:41:02.980
The previous piece was indeed beautiful

00:41:03.020 --> 00:41:03.860
and would earn good scores.

00:41:04.540 --> 00:41:06.100
However, considering her abilities,

00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:07.380
I think we should choose

00:41:07.420 --> 00:41:08.700
a more striking piece for her

00:41:08.700 --> 00:41:09.500
to achieve higher scores.

00:41:10.860 --> 00:41:12.660
But for a competition like this,

00:41:13.060 --> 00:41:15.060
the Youth Group tends
to select light-hearted,

00:41:15.060 --> 00:41:16.460
beautiful and easy to perform pieces.

00:41:18.220 --> 00:41:18.980
The safer the choice,

00:41:19.220 --> 00:41:20.100
the harder it is to stand out.

00:41:21.140 --> 00:41:22.420
At this level of competition,

00:41:22.460 --> 00:41:23.220
you'll face highly skilled competitors.

00:41:23.740 --> 00:41:25.300
Among contestants of similar caliber,

00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:26.620
more than half tend

00:41:26.780 --> 00:41:27.980
to choose the same variation.

00:41:28.380 --> 00:41:30.300
Given these circumstances,

00:41:30.980 --> 00:41:32.020
how confident are you

00:41:32.420 --> 00:41:33.220
about securing a good score?

00:41:36.180 --> 00:41:37.140
Raising the difficulty now,

00:41:37.260 --> 00:41:38.260
can she pull it off?

00:41:40.540 --> 00:41:41.580
There are two months left.

00:41:42.100 --> 00:41:42.700
It's enough.

00:41:44.500 --> 00:41:47.060
Changing the piece, style and variation

00:41:47.540 --> 00:41:48.300
before the competition

00:41:48.620 --> 00:41:49.620
is like switching weapons

00:41:49.620 --> 00:41:50.780
before a battle.

00:41:51.380 --> 00:41:52.220
That's risky.

00:42:13.060 --> 00:42:14.140
Want to dance this variation?

00:42:14.900 --> 00:42:15.260
Yes.

00:42:16.420 --> 00:42:17.180
I mean,

00:42:17.380 --> 00:42:18.140
for this competition,

00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:19.540
want to dance this variation?

00:42:23.780 --> 00:42:24.940
The piece you practiced before

00:42:24.980 --> 00:42:26.860
will make it difficult

00:42:26.900 --> 00:42:27.900
to win a major award.

00:42:28.860 --> 00:42:31.060
When Dusselmeyer was preparing
for her competition,

00:42:31.740 --> 00:42:32.900
she chose the Dream Variation

00:42:32.900 --> 00:42:33.660
from Don Quixote Act II.

00:42:33.660 --> 00:42:34.860
That's too simple for you.

00:42:35.660 --> 00:42:36.980
Can't show all your strengths.

00:42:37.860 --> 00:42:38.580
With your technique

00:42:38.980 --> 00:42:39.820
and expressiveness,

00:42:40.300 --> 00:42:42.180
you can handle a more challenging piece.

00:42:47.380 --> 00:42:48.260
So, will you dance this variation

00:42:49.980 --> 00:42:51.140
for this competition?

00:42:53.700 --> 00:42:54.220
You think

00:42:54.780 --> 00:42:55.940
I can do it?

00:42:57.220 --> 00:42:57.620
Yes.

00:43:00.980 --> 00:43:01.300
Okay.

00:43:03.740 --> 00:43:04.100
Great.
