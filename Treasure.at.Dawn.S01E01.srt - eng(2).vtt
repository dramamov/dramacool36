It's worse than that.

00:30:41.350 --> 00:30:42.660
He was arrested.

They said he was the murderer of the Murder of Physicians.

00:30:48.570 --> 00:30:51.110
Crazy Fu is crazy.

It caused his body to lose balance.

Judging by his landing spot,

00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:52.900
he should have landed his left hip bone on the sack to reduce the force,

My lord, I'm an assistant in the kitchen of the inn.

Physician Fu booked a whole meal at the inn

My boss asked me to find him,

and I saw him halfway

My boss is asking

if your father wants to keep the table.

00:35:47.420 --> 00:35:48.650
Why didn't he tell me

00:35:48.650 --> 00:35:50.050
that he made a reservation?

00:35:50.050 --> 00:35:50.740
At this moment,

all physicians of Shangyi

I think they are studying medicine.

00:35:58.580 --> 00:36:00.820
I wondered why he was trying to get rid of me.

00:36:00.980 --> 00:36:02.210
I need to go back now.

00:36:02.650 --> 00:36:03.490
Wait!

00:36:03.770 --> 00:36:05.020
So, I walk with Fu Sheng

00:36:05.020 --> 00:36:06.770
to the clinic.

00:36:07.620 --> 00:36:08.370
That's when

00:36:08.370 --> 00:36:09.840
we met this lord here.

00:36:10.580 --> 00:36:12.430
Are you Physician Fu?

00:36:15.780 --> 00:36:16.880
Yes.

00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:19.300
And he knocked me out.

00:36:22.260 --> 00:36:23.820
Fu Sheng left

00:36:24.210 --> 00:36:26.580
[1:00 PM]
at about 1:00 PM.

00:36:26.930 --> 00:36:29.370
He arrived at the clinic at about 13:15.

00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:33.330
I passed out for about 15 minutes

00:36:33.740 --> 00:36:36.740
[1:15 PM]
and woke up at 1:15 PM.

00:36:36.740 --> 00:36:38.140
Then I went to the clinic.

00:36:39.420 --> 00:36:42.100
That leaves about a 7.5-minute gap.

00:36:42.260 --> 00:36:42.860
So...

00:36:43.310 --> 00:36:44.420
So, what does that mean?

00:36:45.050 --> 00:36:46.860
That means if Fu Sheng is the one who poisoned the physicians,

00:36:47.050 --> 00:36:49.820
he only had a window of 7.5 minutes.

00:36:50.610 --> 00:36:51.650
Is that possible?

00:36:51.770 --> 00:36:52.990
7.5 minutes might not be long,

00:36:52.990 --> 00:36:54.980
but that's not enough to prove Fu Sheng's innocence.

00:36:55.450 --> 00:36:56.860
What if he premeditated this

00:36:56.860 --> 00:36:58.210
and poisoned the victims before leaving the city?

00:36:59.250 --> 00:37:00.340
Crazy Fu might be crazy,

00:37:00.410 --> 00:37:01.500
but he's not stupid.

00:37:01.740 --> 00:37:03.180
Dr. Fu is his father.

00:37:03.180 --> 00:37:05.090
Why would he poison his own father?

00:37:05.380 --> 00:37:06.590
You just said

00:37:06.590 --> 00:37:07.690
that he's crazy.

00:37:07.890 --> 00:37:10.400
What if he had an episode today?

00:37:10.530 --> 00:37:11.480
"What if?"

00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:13.520
We speak on evidence,

00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:15.130
not what-ifs.

00:37:15.330 --> 00:37:16.010
Of course.

00:37:16.210 --> 00:37:17.160
I put my foot in my mouth.

00:37:19.370 --> 00:37:21.600
What did Fu Sheng do outside the city?

00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:23.280
Was there any witness?

00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:25.840
My lord,

00:37:27.130 --> 00:37:28.820
I saw him at the time.

00:37:29.180 --> 00:37:30.590
[5:00 - 7:00 AM]

00:37:30.590 --> 00:37:31.650
This morning,

00:37:32.210 --> 00:37:34.530
Physician Fu insisted that my ox was ill.

00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:37.040
He opened up my ox

00:37:37.210 --> 00:37:38.650
and removed the poisonous beans from the inside.

00:37:39.150 --> 00:37:40.340
He asked for

00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:42.070
a visit to our village

00:37:42.070 --> 00:37:43.470
to find the perpetrator.

00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:45.070
[7:00 - 9:00 AM]
Here we are.

00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:47.360
Well, I'm surprised.

00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:48.680
You are a rich guy.

00:37:48.830 --> 00:37:49.880
You've got two oxen.

00:37:50.180 --> 00:37:52.150
One of them belongs to Hu, my neighbor.

00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:54.030
To save some construction materials,

00:37:54.150 --> 00:37:55.440
we built a shared shed.

00:37:56.060 --> 00:37:57.110
Last night when I was

00:37:57.340 --> 00:37:58.670
feeding my ox,

00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:01.850
I noticed that there were beans in Hu's feeding trough,

00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:04.080
and I wanted my ox to have some as well.

00:38:04.460 --> 00:38:06.080
The beans are poisonous,

00:38:06.460 --> 00:38:08.370
and there could be trouble if someone ate the beans.

00:38:08.570 --> 00:38:09.470
We need to go right now.

00:38:21.030 --> 00:38:22.150
Now is the time.

00:38:23.870 --> 00:38:24.550
Let's bury him.

00:38:24.980 --> 00:38:25.790
Hold on!

00:38:25.940 --> 00:38:31.140
[7:30 AM]

00:38:32.260 --> 00:38:33.140
Crazy Fu,

00:38:33.590 --> 00:38:34.420
what is this?

00:38:34.670 --> 00:38:35.910
I need to open the coffin for an autopsy.

00:38:36.110 --> 00:38:37.860
My fellow villagers!

00:38:39.230 --> 00:38:40.420
Crazy Fu might be unconventional,

00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:43.980
of the county office.

00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:45.200
Autopsy

00:38:45.490 --> 00:38:47.680
is within his pay grade.

00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:48.440
As an administrator

00:38:48.730 --> 00:38:50.680
of the village,

00:38:51.730 --> 00:38:53.200
I cannot let a villager

00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:55.410
pass away with the reason unclear.

00:38:56.230 --> 00:38:57.190
In light of that,

00:38:57.710 --> 00:38:58.490
Open the coffin.

00:39:02.110 --> 00:39:02.980
Let's take a look, guys.

00:39:04.510 --> 00:39:05.690
The corpse's eyes are yellowed,

00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:08.130
and the face is bluish and swollen.

00:39:10.150 --> 00:39:11.210
Besides, I'm sure

00:39:11.710 --> 00:39:13.210
that there's poison residual in his stomach.

00:39:13.230 --> 00:39:14.980
A silver needle can testify to that.

00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:18.470
He's right!

00:39:20.510 --> 00:39:21.050
The needle turned black.

00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:24.240
What really killed him was

00:39:24.830 --> 00:39:25.650
Kusnezoff monkshood mother root.

00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:27.810
That's how he revealed the truth

00:39:28.050 --> 00:39:29.240
of a murder.

00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:31.450
That's impressive.

00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:33.170
This lunatic

00:39:33.770 --> 00:39:35.770
can cure diseases and solve cases.

00:39:36.590 --> 00:39:37.770
He does have some tricks up his sleeves.

00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:39.050
Agreed.

00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:42.010
When did he leave the village?

00:39:42.570 --> 00:39:43.720
I think it was

00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:45.650
10:00 AM

00:39:46.130 --> 00:39:48.150
The time fits

00:39:48.150 --> 00:39:49.170
the cook's description.

00:39:51.050 --> 00:39:52.570
If you spoke the truth

00:39:52.910 --> 00:39:54.540
and he did stay outside the city for so long

00:39:54.540 --> 00:39:55.860
without showing the intention of hurrying back,

00:39:56.220 --> 00:39:57.910
then he didn't mind his time

00:39:57.910 --> 00:39:59.230
of returning to the city.

00:40:00.290 --> 00:40:02.030
Assuming he's the perpetrator,

00:40:02.250 --> 00:40:03.770
he'd be rushing to get back

00:40:03.770 --> 00:40:05.360
before the physicians go to lunch at 12:00 PM.

00:40:06.150 --> 00:40:06.980
In that case,

00:40:07.270 --> 00:40:08.790
his timeline doesn't fit with the perpetrator's.

00:40:09.190 --> 00:40:09.980
Aide,

00:40:10.630 --> 00:40:11.820
now that I'm hearing this,

00:40:11.820 --> 00:40:13.970
I also think Fu Sheng is innocent.

00:40:14.310 --> 00:40:15.020
My lord!

00:40:15.550 --> 00:40:17.270
If we don't hold Fu Sheng accountable for the crime,

00:40:17.310 --> 00:40:19.040
there will be even more trouble

00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:20.680
now that the Princess is involved.

00:40:21.150 --> 00:40:21.790
My lord!

00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:23.310
There are so many things not clear about this case.

00:40:23.430 --> 00:40:25.010
Fu Sheng has no time to commit the crime.

00:40:25.150 --> 00:40:26.310
You arrested the wrong guy.

00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:28.310
Who told you I arrested Fu Sheng?

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:31.620
Besides, the testimony of these two

00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:34.360
is insufficient to clear the suspicion of Fu Sheng.

00:40:34.630 --> 00:40:36.070
Can someone give me a hand?

00:40:36.120 --> 00:40:37.000
What happened?

00:40:37.310 --> 00:40:38.670
I need someone bold, cautious,

00:40:38.670 --> 00:40:39.670
and with steady hands to assist me.

00:40:39.820 --> 00:40:40.680
I can help!

00:40:41.050 --> 00:40:42.510
My lord, you can't do that. That brings an ill omen.

00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:44.650
I can go!

00:40:45.330 --> 00:40:45.960
No!

00:40:46.010 --> 00:40:48.520
You are a male. How can you enter a delivery room?

00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:49.290
But...

00:40:49.860 --> 00:40:50.640
I can help.

00:40:52.810 --> 00:40:54.240
I heard that you have uncanny medical knowledge,

00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:55.410
and I'd like to see for myself.

00:40:56.690 --> 00:40:57.570
Blood doesn't bother you, right?

00:40:57.570 --> 00:40:58.120
No.

00:40:58.120 --> 00:40:59.000
Great. Let's go.

00:41:02.210 --> 00:41:04.120
We are in an emergency, and I only have time to explain once.

00:41:04.650 --> 00:41:06.480
I'll cut from here later,

00:41:06.570 --> 00:41:08.080
and after I've opened up the abdomen,

00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:09.690
hold the wound open for me.

00:41:09.890 --> 00:41:11.360
Once I get the child,

00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:12.930
cut the umbilical cord immediately

00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:14.510
and get the baby.

00:41:14.510 --> 00:41:15.450
Have you got all that?

00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:17.340
Aren't you afraid?

00:41:17.670 --> 00:41:19.050
You should be the one afraid.

00:41:19.050 --> 00:41:20.290
You'd better make no mistakes,

00:41:20.290 --> 00:41:22.120
or Lord Yang won't let you off.

00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:24.240
Human lives are at stake here.

00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:26.600
They come first.

00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:34.740
[Tranquility]

00:41:39.410 --> 00:41:40.720
They've been gone for long.

00:41:45.670 --> 00:41:46.410
How did it go?

00:41:46.410 --> 00:41:47.340
Thank you for your patience.

00:41:53.320 --> 00:41:53.960
It's a boy.

00:41:54.770 --> 00:41:55.540
A boy!

00:41:58.290 --> 00:42:00.990
This family now has an heir.

00:42:03.170 --> 00:42:03.790
Ah, Fu Sheng!

00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:05.260
How is my wife doing?

00:42:05.350 --> 00:42:06.420
She's fine.

00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:07.770
She hasn't recovered her strength yet.

00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:08.910
I have left a prescription.

00:42:09.050 --> 00:42:10.990
Ask the servant to get the medicines on the prescription.

00:42:11.080 --> 00:42:12.360
Do not get water on the wound,

00:42:12.510 --> 00:42:13.970
or there could be an infection

00:42:13.970 --> 00:42:15.030
that can be life-threatening.

00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:17.410
Okay.

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:18.650
Fu Sheng.

00:42:19.050 --> 00:42:20.890
You are a savior for my family.

00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:25.410
My lord!

00:42:25.930 --> 00:42:27.770
Fu Sheng, what is this about?

00:42:28.650 --> 00:42:29.990
I need a favor.

00:42:30.650 --> 00:42:31.090
Come on.

00:42:31.090 --> 00:42:31.690
Stand up.

00:42:33.370 --> 00:42:33.800
Tell me what you want.

00:42:34.450 --> 00:42:36.330
I want to take over the investigation of this case.

00:42:37.370 --> 00:42:40.100
Let me find my father's murderer and clean my name.

00:42:41.060 --> 00:42:41.710
Fu Sheng,

00:42:41.710 --> 00:42:43.700
you already pleaded guilty.

00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:45.270
Guards!

00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:46.170
Yes!

00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:47.750
Get Fu Sheng to sign the confession.

00:42:48.640 --> 00:42:49.440
Hold on!

00:42:50.470 --> 00:42:51.780
Details of this case are not clear.

00:42:52.030 --> 00:42:53.620
How can you give your judgment in haste?

00:42:54.630 --> 00:42:57.060
Giving Fu Sheng the access to the investigation

00:42:57.260 --> 00:42:58.740
is against the rules, my lord.

00:42:59.190 --> 00:42:59.990
My lord,

00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:02.290
the aide arrested me

00:43:02.710 --> 00:43:03.800
for three reasons.

00:43:04.060 --> 00:43:05.360
I also have three reasons

00:43:05.400 --> 00:43:06.880
to be a part of the investigation.

00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:07.920
Fu Sheng,

00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:10.360
my reasons are logical.

00:43:10.510 --> 00:43:11.560
I didn't make anything up.

00:43:11.560 --> 00:43:12.410
Aide,

00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:14.510
my reasons

00:43:14.750 --> 00:43:15.990
are all genuine.

00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:17.400
- What could you...- First,

00:43:18.990 --> 00:43:21.080
I'm the clerk of the county.

00:43:21.230 --> 00:43:24.320
Autopsy is within my duty.

00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:27.120
Second, my father is a victim.

00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:29.160
As his son,

00:43:29.270 --> 00:43:31.640
I'm obligated to find the murderer and revenge my father.

00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:33.270
Third,

00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:35.360
and this is the most important one,

00:43:35.560 --> 00:43:36.950
I'm a suspect in this case,

00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:39.540
and I don't think there's anyone with a stronger desire

00:43:39.540 --> 00:43:40.820
to find out the truth more than me

00:43:40.970 --> 00:43:41.960
since it's my innocence that's on the line.

00:44:04.230 --> 00:44:05.650
How many more lives

00:44:06.110 --> 00:44:07.820
my sword will have to take?
