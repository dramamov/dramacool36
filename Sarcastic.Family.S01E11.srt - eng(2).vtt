Meng Hang

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:09.319
Take a look.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:10.039
Look.

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:11.240
What's wrong?

00:02:11.439 --> 00:02:11.960
See for yourself.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:12.680
Look, look.

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:14.599
At that emotional support group,

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:15.360
the thing where you yelled at me

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:16.680
got posted on the public account.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:17.560
See?

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:18.479
Mom,

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:20.280
it's not a big deal.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.039
That support group isn't big.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.439
Just a few people were there.

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:24.840
Outsiders can't see it.

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:25.719
They can't see it.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.599
Thousands have shared it.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.639
I saw it in Lao Gao's Moments.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:45.479
Mom

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.280
You're trending now.

00:02:47.919 --> 00:02:48.759
Trending? What do you mean?

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:49.840
So I'm trending?

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.039
You need to fix this for me.

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.879
Or else I won't let this go.

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:52.840
Wait, wait.

00:02:52.919 --> 00:02:53.680
Mom, mom, mom.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:54.280
Mom, mom.

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:56.280
This is a good thing!

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:57.599
Look at the comments section.

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:59.879
They're talking about your last part.

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:01.800
Your rant was so satisfying.

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:03.800
They want you to start livestreaming.

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.000
Be their mouth stand-in.

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:06.919
Help them with their relationship issues.

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.479
You

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.240
could definitely be an influencer.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.199
Influencer.

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.000
That's someone who

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.039
just sits there

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.960
and people send them gifts.

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:16.120
Even virtual sports cars.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:17.719
Not just cars—

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.080
They'd send you a giant rocket.

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.439
Then I'd be rich enough to fly to Antarctica.

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:27.319
I mean,

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.039
I'm worried you're tricking me.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.520
If no one sends me gifts,

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:32.680
I'll come after you.

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:33.319
Don't worry.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.599
Give it some time.

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.719
You'll become a mega-influencer.

00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:40.879
So popular you'll be legendary.

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:43.680
Could this get any sillier?

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:47.039
It's a good thing.

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:48.560
Good thing, good thing, good thing.

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.639
Uh...

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:53.759
Look.

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:56.680
Why does my face look so big?

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:58.599
I haven't set it up yet.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:01.199
There, that's better.

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.039
Isn't this me from twenty years ago?

00:04:06.719 --> 00:04:08.919
Did you invent a time machine?

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:10.680
Mom, you really joke around.

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.479
I just put a filter on you.

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:14.120
And some skin smoothing.

00:04:14.439 --> 00:04:16.079
No wrinkles, so you look younger.

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:17.839
What do you mean "look"?

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:22.000
Meng Meng.

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:23.839
What are you busy with here?

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.279
He's helping me become an influencer.

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.519
You can be an influencer now?

00:04:29.519 --> 00:04:30.560
This beauty filter—

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.040
Are you an influencer

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.120
or a catfish?

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:34.839
Aren't you afraid of the cyber police?

00:04:34.959 --> 00:04:36.040
Why do you talk like that?

00:04:36.319 --> 00:04:37.439
I just mean,

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.040
you're naturally beautiful.

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.399
You don't need these effects.

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:41.319
Right, Meng Meng?

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:42.279
I need to talk to you about something serious.

00:04:42.399 --> 00:04:42.800
Let's go.

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:43.439
Go, go, go.

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:44.240
Go on, go on, go on.

00:04:44.399 --> 00:04:45.000
I'll handle it myself.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.519
Good thing you helped me out just now.

00:04:52.079 --> 00:04:52.879
I told your mom

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:53.759
she could be an influencer.

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:54.319
She believed it.

00:04:54.319 --> 00:04:55.199
Now she wants my help.

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:56.240
But I have no idea how.

00:04:56.879 --> 00:04:58.160
I wasn't just helping you out.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.439
I really do have something important.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:00.600
What is it?

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:02.120
Our wedding.

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.879
Did you forget?

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:05.600
How could I forget?

00:05:06.279 --> 00:05:07.800
We bought the rings, didn't we?

00:05:08.879 --> 00:05:11.120
Just finding the rings isn't the whole job.

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.480
Are you a Hobbit?

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:15.720
My precious ring.

00:05:15.879 --> 00:05:16.759
Take it back for me.

00:05:18.439 --> 00:05:19.079
Let me ask you—

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:20.439
What's our wedding theme?

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:21.879
Our wedding is about

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.240
pure, flawless love.

00:05:24.439 --> 00:05:26.040
Are you doing reading comprehension?

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:27.959
I mean the visual theme.

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.879
Hotel style,

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:29.839
clothing style,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.120
cars, flowers,

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:31.720
decorations, all that.

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:32.839
Don't you need to decide?

00:05:32.839 --> 00:05:33.360
Yes.

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.560
Did you look at the references I sent?

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:37.879
Who? Who?

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:38.720
The ones from Sister Xia.

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:39.560
Sister Yang.

00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:40.680
The ones from Sister Yang.

00:05:41.319 --> 00:05:42.360
Doesn't matter which sister.

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.560
Don't let her brainwash you, okay?

00:05:44.839 --> 00:05:46.079
Other people's opinions don't matter.

00:05:46.439 --> 00:05:47.839
As long as we're happy.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:48.439
That's enough.

00:05:49.399 --> 00:05:51.439
I think you're absolutely right.

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.079
Our own happiness is what matters.

00:05:53.519 --> 00:05:54.560
So I found a few

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:56.199
examples I'm really happy with.

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:56.879
Take a look.

00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:59.600
Prince Harry's wedding.

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.000
Princess Diana's wedding.

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.480
King Charles's wedding.

00:06:07.519 --> 00:06:08.639
That's about enough.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.079
Those are way too high-level.

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:12.720
Uh...

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:14.399
Any lower-ranking officials?

00:06:15.399 --> 00:06:15.920
Uh, uh...

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:17.040
Just the seating alone—

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:18.439
must be over a thousand people.

00:06:18.959 --> 00:06:20.079
Thanks for reminding me.

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:21.759
How many tables do we need?

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:22.879
Ten people per table.

00:06:24.319 --> 00:06:25.399
Count how many are coming.

00:06:25.439 --> 00:06:26.480
Divide by ten, that's it.

00:06:27.319 --> 00:06:28.839
Count how many people.

00:06:29.959 --> 00:06:30.600
Let me ask you—

00:06:30.879 --> 00:06:32.519
Our parents' senior college

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.000
music class: twenty-two people,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.120
art class: sixteen people,

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:36.240
literature class: nineteen people.

00:06:36.279 --> 00:06:38.600
In the art class, on average, four people

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:39.800
know how to play an instrument.

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:41.800
Each senior can join up to two classes.

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.000
No one in literature class

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.120
is in more than one class.

00:06:44.199 --> 00:06:45.120
So how many people are there in total?

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:51.480
Next question

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:53.639
A lot of people from our company
will be coming too

00:06:53.839 --> 00:06:55.600
First, our boss, Mr. Li

00:06:55.639 --> 00:06:57.120
has to sit at the head seat

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:58.360
The boss's wife must sit next to him

00:06:58.519 --> 00:07:01.319
But no female guest can sit
on the other side of the boss

00:07:01.319 --> 00:07:03.240
Xiaoli and Xiao Liu are exes

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:04.680
They can't sit directly across
from each other

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:05.680
Nor can they sit side by side

00:07:05.839 --> 00:07:06.839
Meanwhile

00:07:06.839 --> 00:07:08.519
Keke can't sit next to anyone who smokes

00:07:08.519 --> 00:07:10.759
But Xiao Li, Xiao Wu, and Manager Zhang
all smoke

00:07:10.759 --> 00:07:11.800
So, may I ask

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:13.000
how many seating arrangements

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.839
are possible for these people

00:07:14.839 --> 00:07:16.519
and list them all

00:07:23.519 --> 00:07:25.120
Teacher, I have an idea

00:07:25.439 --> 00:07:26.240
What did you think of

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.000
The manager asked me to work overtime today

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:29.560
I was busy comforting your mom

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:30.759
I totally forgot about it

00:07:30.839 --> 00:07:31.800
I need to hurry over there

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:32.319
I'm running late

00:07:32.319 --> 00:07:32.639
How about this

00:07:32.639 --> 00:07:33.680
Wait, I haven't finished yet

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:34.720
I'll tell you more when I get back tonight

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:42.199
Love

00:07:42.519 --> 00:07:45.000
is the crown of life

00:07:46.279 --> 00:07:49.319
A slight shake can make it fall

00:07:50.319 --> 00:07:52.160
How does love tolerate

00:07:52.959 --> 00:07:54.920
How does love respect

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:57.920
How does love make people
in the livestream

00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:59.360
become fewer and fewer

00:08:01.279 --> 00:08:03.800
Welcome this viewer to join my stream

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:05.639
Hello, Auntie Cai

00:08:05.959 --> 00:08:06.879
Hello

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:09.040
I'm one of your earliest fans

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:11.560
I left a comment under your public account

00:08:11.639 --> 00:08:13.279
I was one of those who asked you
to start livestreaming

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:15.040
What you said back then

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:16.680
really resonated with me

00:08:17.079 --> 00:08:17.680
Because my mom

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:19.519
also doesn't get along with my boyfriend

00:08:21.519 --> 00:08:23.079
Between family members

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:26.319
the most important thing is understanding

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:27.160
Because

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:27.879
home

00:08:28.199 --> 00:08:29.560
is where, when we're out there

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:30.920
and face setbacks

00:08:30.959 --> 00:08:33.399
it's the warmest safe haven

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:34.600
No

00:08:34.799 --> 00:08:35.639
Why are you

00:08:35.639 --> 00:08:37.000
speaking so differently today

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:38.759
I wanted to hear you roast people

00:08:38.759 --> 00:08:40.200
Who wants all this inspirational talk

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:43.559
You should've said so earlier

00:08:43.679 --> 00:08:44.960
Pretending was exhausting

00:08:45.519 --> 00:08:45.919
Alright

00:08:47.399 --> 00:08:48.200
Then tell me

00:08:48.519 --> 00:08:50.879
Why doesn't your mom get along
with your boyfriend

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:52.879
My mom thinks he doesn't work

00:08:52.879 --> 00:08:54.120
He always spends my money

00:08:54.879 --> 00:08:55.440
Girl

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:57.960
Are you dating

00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:59.120
or running a charity

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:00.679
Is he missing an arm

00:09:00.679 --> 00:09:01.840
or a leg

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:02.679
Neither

00:09:02.879 --> 00:09:04.120
Then you're the one lacking sense

00:09:04.679 --> 00:09:05.919
What does he do

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:06.919
He's in the arts

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:08.240
Chasing his dreams

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:09.360
What's his dream

00:09:09.399 --> 00:09:10.120
To live off a woman

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:11.080
Girl

00:09:11.639 --> 00:09:12.799
A man who isn't independent

00:09:13.039 --> 00:09:14.120
is like a rotten vegetable patch

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:15.679
A man who lives off a woman

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:17.080
will ruin the marriage

00:09:17.279 --> 00:09:18.240
Take my advice

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:19.000
Break up

00:09:19.159 --> 00:09:20.559
But he likes me

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:21.679
Girl

00:09:21.679 --> 00:09:22.720
With your looks

00:09:22.799 --> 00:09:24.679
Men who like you are like the subway

00:09:24.879 --> 00:09:26.120
Miss this train

00:09:26.919 --> 00:09:28.279
the next one comes in five minutes

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:30.120
If you agree with me

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:31.200
please give a like

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:32.639
Within five minutes

00:09:32.759 --> 00:09:34.200
if you get ten thousand likes

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:35.000
then break up

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:35.799
Deal

00:09:38.879 --> 00:09:40.559
Break up, honey

00:10:06.559 --> 00:10:07.960
What's up

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:10.960
Working overtime secretly
on the weekend

00:10:11.039 --> 00:10:12.480
Trying to outdo me, huh

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:14.399
Aren't you here too

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:15.960
I'm not like you

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:18.120
I left my game console at work

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:20.399
Who works overtime
on the weekend for fun

00:10:20.399 --> 00:10:20.919
Right

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:28.679
You

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:30.399
What's going on?

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:33.559
Too much pressure at home.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.519
Came out to make a couple presentations.

00:10:35.639 --> 00:10:36.519
Just to relax a bit.

00:10:37.879 --> 00:10:39.799
That's a pretty novel way to unwind.

00:10:42.159 --> 00:10:43.879
You have no idea.

00:10:44.679 --> 00:10:46.360
I'm planning a wedding, you know.

00:10:48.559 --> 00:10:50.320
It's not as easy as I thought.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:52.960
Right?

00:10:53.159 --> 00:10:54.879
Your wife has a ton of demands.

00:10:55.159 --> 00:10:55.960
She wants this one minute,

00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:57.000
then something else the next.

00:10:57.679 --> 00:10:58.960
A ten-thousand budget,

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:01.039
but wants a hundred-thousand result.

00:11:01.279 --> 00:11:01.759
Isn't that right?

00:11:02.039 --> 00:11:02.960
How did you know?

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:05.440
Isn't that just like a client?

00:11:06.039 --> 00:11:06.600
Next,

00:11:06.879 --> 00:11:08.600
she'll make you submit endless proposals.

00:11:08.879 --> 00:11:10.919
When you've revised it eight hundred times,

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:11.799
she'll tell you

00:11:12.039 --> 00:11:12.679
the first draft

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:13.440
was the best.

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:16.120
So what do you do?

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:19.360
That's what I'm here for.

00:11:19.799 --> 00:11:20.480
I'll teach you.

00:11:20.759 --> 00:11:22.720
Just handle her like you handle clients.

00:11:22.919 --> 00:11:23.759
Treat your wife the same way.

00:11:23.799 --> 00:11:24.360
That's it.

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:26.240
How do I do that?

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:29.480
Have you noticed a pattern?

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:30.879
It's that

00:11:31.039 --> 00:11:33.320
if you finish a week before the deadline,

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:34.960
after you finish the proposal,

00:11:35.039 --> 00:11:36.759
before you hand it to the client,

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:38.960
the boss will always make you revise it twice.

00:11:39.279 --> 00:11:40.639
But if you wait

00:11:40.639 --> 00:11:42.440
until the last minute to submit,

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:45.080
the boss sends it straight to the client.

00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:46.720
And praises you for being on time.

00:11:47.039 --> 00:11:49.080
So the key is one word.

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:51.279
Delay.

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:52.960
From

00:11:53.039 --> 00:11:55.759
"I want a perfect wedding"

00:11:55.879 --> 00:11:56.440
to

00:11:56.519 --> 00:11:58.320
"Booking a hotel is good enough."

00:11:58.799 --> 00:11:59.519
Got it?

00:12:00.679 --> 00:12:02.559
But what if she keeps rushing me?

00:12:03.159 --> 00:12:05.240
Just say you're busy at work.

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:06.240
No time.

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:08.320
Always at the office till late.

00:12:08.639 --> 00:12:09.200
So what?

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:10.600
She can't stop you from working overtime.

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:13.759
Once you've dragged it out long enough,

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:14.879
then it's

00:12:14.879 --> 00:12:15.799
up to you to decide.

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:16.759
That's how it is.

00:12:17.159 --> 00:12:17.600
Right?

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:29.240
You already agreed.

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:30.600
So stop dragging me into this.

00:12:31.639 --> 00:12:32.559
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

00:12:32.559 --> 00:12:33.279
I'll treat you to a late-night snack.

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:37.960
I'll take care of it.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:38.559
Come on.

00:12:41.159 --> 00:12:42.480
This user says,

00:12:42.559 --> 00:12:45.480
"My boyfriend said he went on a trip alone,"

00:12:45.679 --> 00:12:47.519
but the receipt shows

00:12:47.519 --> 00:12:48.960
two people checked in.

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:50.600
What's up with that?

00:12:52.679 --> 00:12:53.639
Girl, let me tell you,

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:55.240
isn't it obvious?

00:12:55.639 --> 00:12:56.399
Some people

00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:57.480
travel on company money,

00:12:57.679 --> 00:12:59.480
some cheat on company money.

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:00.799
If you're hesitating,

00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:01.879
just break up.

00:13:03.159 --> 00:13:04.000
Next one.

00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:07.559
I've fallen for my teacher.

00:13:07.559 --> 00:13:10.399
But the age gap is huge.

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:12.200
Kid,

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:13.320
you need to focus on your studies.

00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:15.200
Finals are coming up soon.

00:13:16.159 --> 00:13:17.200
I'm eighty.

00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:18.600
He's sixty-five.

00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:21.120
Senior college, huh?

00:13:22.159 --> 00:13:22.600
You—

00:13:22.879 --> 00:13:24.159
That beauty filter works!

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:25.679
You made me look great, see?

00:13:26.039 --> 00:13:26.799
You—this—this—

00:13:26.799 --> 00:13:27.639
I'm streaming here.

00:13:27.639 --> 00:13:28.279
Don't mess around.

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:31.399
People are actually watching.

00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:32.559
What did you expect?

00:13:32.799 --> 00:13:34.559
Hundreds of viewers are watching me.

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:35.960
Go play with Meng Hang.

00:13:36.039 --> 00:13:37.360
Don't distract me from my work.

00:13:37.399 --> 00:13:38.480
He's working overtime.

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:39.399
I'll just hang out here for a bit.

00:13:39.399 --> 00:13:40.240
I won't bother you.

00:13:42.919 --> 00:13:44.279
As for this friend,

00:13:44.879 --> 00:13:46.879
your earlier question

00:13:46.879 --> 00:13:48.120
the issue is

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:53.879
Alright.

00:13:54.679 --> 00:13:56.159
About your question just now,

00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:58.720
don't overthink it.

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:05.320
If you're bored,

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:06.200
help me out

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:08.440
and reply to those fan DMs.

00:14:08.519 --> 00:14:09.559
Over a thousand messages.

00:14:09.559 --> 00:14:10.080
They're piling up.

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:11.919
That many?

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.039
What did you think?

00:14:13.559 --> 00:14:15.080
I'm a top influencer now.

00:14:15.159 --> 00:14:16.679
Who says I can't be an influencer?

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:18.759
Alright.

00:14:18.759 --> 00:14:19.759
Bye, bye, bye.

00:14:22.279 --> 00:14:23.039
That's my neighbor.

00:14:23.879 --> 00:14:24.840
Let's get back to business.

00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:31.240
This husband is such a scumbag.

00:14:33.879 --> 00:14:36.120
This wife is such a scumbag.

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:40.639
This sister-in-law is such a scumbag.

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:52.519
Lately, my online boyfriend

00:14:52.759 --> 00:14:54.159
keeps saying he's working overtime.

00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:55.039
Super busy.

00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:56.600
Barely pays attention to me.

00:14:57.159 --> 00:14:59.159
I feel like he's seeing someone else.

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:00.840
Can you help me figure it out?

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:01.840
What's going on?

00:15:08.759 --> 00:15:09.879
Michael

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:12.519
Looks so familiar.

00:15:26.919 --> 00:15:28.320
Michael

00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:58.399
I've been really busy lately.

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:01.600
How are you, Li Li?

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:02.279
Have you eaten?

00:16:03.639 --> 00:16:04.320
No, I haven't.

00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:06.559
Why didn't you eat?

00:16:07.679 --> 00:16:09.279
I'm working overtime outside.

00:16:09.399 --> 00:16:11.240
Make sure to take care of yourself at home.

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:13.399
Let me ask you something.

00:16:14.559 --> 00:16:16.840
Do you have an English name at work?

00:16:16.919 --> 00:16:17.639
What's it called?

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:18.799
Michael.

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:21.120
This company,

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:23.039
to make foreign clients feel welcome,

00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:24.279
gave me that name.

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:27.000
But foreigners love using Chinese names.

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:27.679
Da Zhuang,

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:28.519
Xiufen, things like that.

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:30.399
So, Michael, right?

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:34.159
What have you been busy with these days?

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:35.360
It's been super busy.

00:16:35.639 --> 00:16:37.559
Our company just started a new project.

00:16:37.919 --> 00:16:38.720
A new project?

00:16:39.759 --> 00:16:41.720
Is the new one better than the old?

00:16:43.279 --> 00:16:44.480
Not necessarily.

00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:47.000
We can't abandon the old one either.

00:16:47.519 --> 00:16:48.440
Anyway,

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:49.840
the more, the better.

00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:50.559
Right?

00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:52.879
Yeah.

00:16:54.679 --> 00:16:55.720
If you're so busy,

00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:57.000
maybe postpone the wedding for now.

00:16:59.399 --> 00:17:00.399
You're hesitating.

00:17:00.399 --> 00:17:01.519
Meng Hang, you're hesitating.

00:17:01.519 --> 00:17:02.559
I'm just drinking water.

00:17:02.759 --> 00:17:04.079
Now you're changing the subject.

00:17:04.079 --> 00:17:05.039
No, I'm not.

00:17:05.279 --> 00:17:06.759
What, you want to get physical now?

00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:10.480
How could I ever do that?

00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:11.839
When a couple is together,

00:17:11.839 --> 00:17:14.000
no matter what, you can't get physical.

00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:16.119
What if you did something wrong?

00:17:16.559 --> 00:17:18.160
Even if I did something wrong,

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:20.160
you still can't get physical.

00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:23.039
So you admit it?

00:17:23.519 --> 00:17:24.200
Go ahead,

00:17:24.359 --> 00:17:25.079
what did you do wrong?

00:17:26.799 --> 00:17:28.640
I—I didn't do anything wrong.

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:30.039
You just said you did something wrong.

00:17:37.759 --> 00:17:39.000
How about we go to sleep?

00:17:40.599 --> 00:17:41.119
Sure.

00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:08.079
Listen up.

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:17.720
I'll sing this song at the wedding.

00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:18.240
How's that?

00:18:18.759 --> 00:18:19.680
Don't mention Li Li.

00:18:20.759 --> 00:18:21.960
Li Li kicked me out.

00:18:23.079 --> 00:18:24.119
Li Li got mad.

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:25.200
No, she didn't.

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:27.680
She said she didn't.

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:30.240
If a woman says she's not mad,

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:31.799
she's definitely mad.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.119
Think about it carefully.

00:18:33.119 --> 00:18:34.279
How did you let her down?

00:18:37.759 --> 00:18:38.200
You—

00:18:40.279 --> 00:18:40.799
Come sit over here.

00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:42.119
Close the door.

00:18:53.319 --> 00:18:55.519
You've been coming home late these days.

00:18:56.319 --> 00:18:57.000
What are you doing?

00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:58.200
Working overtime.

00:18:58.200 --> 00:18:59.039
Yeah, right.

00:18:59.319 --> 00:19:01.400
Is it trendy to show houses at midnight now?

00:19:01.799 --> 00:19:02.920
Are you selling haunted houses?

00:19:03.839 --> 00:19:04.599
Be honest with me.

00:19:08.079 --> 00:19:09.160
It's just that Li Li's been

00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:10.759
pushing for the wedding lately.

00:19:11.559 --> 00:19:13.759
But I can't meet her demands.

00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:15.240
So I thought

00:19:15.319 --> 00:19:16.279
I'd stall her for a while.

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:17.960
How long are you planning to stall?

00:19:18.759 --> 00:19:21.200
Until she feels time's running out.

00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:23.640
Then I'll offer her a compromise.

00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:24.680
She'll have to accept it.

00:19:25.759 --> 00:19:26.640
Everyone's happy.

00:19:27.759 --> 00:19:30.119
That's being irresponsible.

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:31.440
A man can't be irresponsible.

00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:33.480
An irresponsible man

00:19:33.559 --> 00:19:34.400
is like

00:19:34.759 --> 00:19:36.599
instant noodles without a seasoning packet,

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:38.480
a convenience store without oden,

00:19:38.759 --> 00:19:40.200
an aircraft carrier with no planes.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:42.559
Didn't my mom say that about you back then?

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:45.119
I've changed.

00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:47.559
The court even praised me during the divorce.

00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:48.960
Said I took full responsibility.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:51.680
Better late than never.

00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:52.559
It's not too late.

00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:53.119
Lately,

00:19:53.119 --> 00:19:54.160
be nicer to Li Li.

00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:55.319
Make it up to her.

00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:56.359
It's not a big deal.

00:19:56.519 --> 00:19:57.720
No need to look so worried.

00:20:00.599 --> 00:20:02.119
You're right.

00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:02.960
Aren't you?

00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:11.359
How about singing this song at the wedding?

00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:12.039
Let's discuss it later.

00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:13.759
Don't—don't put it off again.

00:20:13.759 --> 00:20:14.960
I need a year to practice it.

00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:19.039
No wonder he's never home these days.

00:20:19.039 --> 00:20:20.359
Turns out there's someone else outside.

00:20:22.079 --> 00:20:23.279
Don't be so pessimistic.

00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:25.039
Try to look on the bright side.

00:20:25.279 --> 00:20:25.839
How do I do that?

00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:27.000
Maybe—

00:20:27.039 --> 00:20:28.880
They knew each other first.

00:20:29.079 --> 00:20:30.680
You're the other person.

00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:33.440
Mom, if you're so good at talking,

00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:34.440
then just stop talking.

00:20:35.039 --> 00:20:36.200
Let me use your account for a bit.

00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:37.759
Why, why, why?

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:39.119
Are you going to expose him online?

00:20:39.359 --> 00:20:40.160
No.

00:20:40.279 --> 00:20:42.079
I just want to ask that girl out to talk.

00:20:42.079 --> 00:20:43.160
What if it's just a misunderstanding?

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:43.880
A misunderstanding?

00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:46.279
You believe it's a misunderstanding,

00:20:46.279 --> 00:20:47.640
or do you believe I'm Qin Shi Huang?

00:20:48.799 --> 00:20:50.880
Just let me use it, please.

00:20:51.119 --> 00:20:51.759
Alright.

00:20:54.119 --> 00:20:55.480
If it turns out to be true,

00:20:55.559 --> 00:20:57.680
don't forget to use my account

00:20:57.720 --> 00:20:58.559
to cry about it.

00:20:58.839 --> 00:20:59.720
Then I can

00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:01.240
gain a few more followers.

00:21:02.559 --> 00:21:03.480
At a time like this,

00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:05.079
you're still thinking about your followers?

00:21:09.839 --> 00:21:11.039
You are

00:21:11.079 --> 00:21:12.799
AILISHASHA XIAOBEIBAO

00:21:12.799 --> 00:21:13.359
right?

00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:14.400
Kitty cat.

00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:17.240
Yes, kitty cat.

00:21:18.519 --> 00:21:19.400
Auntie Cai.

00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:21.480
You look much younger than on the livestream.

00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:23.400
Um—

00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:24.519
I'm her assistant.

00:21:25.759 --> 00:21:27.119
Because your case

00:21:27.119 --> 00:21:27.960
is rather special,

00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:29.559
we invited you out

00:21:29.559 --> 00:21:31.039
to get some info in person.

00:21:31.279 --> 00:21:32.400
So professional.

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:34.079
No wonder you gained

00:21:34.079 --> 00:21:35.599
thousands of followers so quickly.

00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:36.240
That's right.

00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:41.079
So, the man you mentioned in your submission—

00:21:41.079 --> 00:21:42.279
how did you meet him?

00:21:42.839 --> 00:21:44.640
We met through a mobile app.

00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:45.920
We got to know each other on Tantanlu.

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:47.240
See—

00:21:47.359 --> 00:21:48.319
At first,

00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:50.240
he chatted with me nonstop.

00:21:50.599 --> 00:21:53.200
But lately, he's suddenly become distant.

00:21:53.559 --> 00:21:54.880
I suspect he's cheating.

00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:56.319
That's why I submitted my story.

00:21:59.279 --> 00:22:01.359
How much do you know about him?

00:22:01.559 --> 00:22:03.279
What does he do? What does he look like?

00:22:03.599 --> 00:22:05.559
We met online.

00:22:05.839 --> 00:22:08.240
He works nearby as a real estate agent.

00:22:08.319 --> 00:22:09.079
His name is Michael.

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:11.759
In his profile,

00:22:11.759 --> 00:22:13.200
there are no photos of himself.

00:22:13.559 --> 00:22:14.720
It's all scenery.

00:22:14.759 --> 00:22:15.759
He's

00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:16.960
very artsy.

00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:18.480
He loves traveling.

00:22:20.319 --> 00:22:21.000
That's it.

00:22:21.119 --> 00:22:21.720
Exactly.

00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:24.319
You don't even know what he looks like,

00:22:24.319 --> 00:22:25.559
yet you're dating him?

00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:28.200
Photos and videos can't be trusted now.

00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:30.200
Only your feelings are reliable.

00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:32.599
Your feelings aren't that accurate either.

00:22:32.759 --> 00:22:35.000
Didn't you sense that he's already married?

00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:36.720
That's impossible.

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:37.960
Why not?

00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:38.920
He's my husband.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:40.799
Really?

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:42.559
Look—

00:22:42.839 --> 00:22:43.599
this photo.

00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:45.440
See?

00:22:46.079 --> 00:22:47.119
These photos—

00:22:47.359 --> 00:22:48.440
they're all from two years ago,

00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:50.640
when his company organized an overseas trip.

00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:51.359
He took them.

00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:53.680
He's only been abroad once in his life.

00:22:53.799 --> 00:22:54.839
And he claims to love traveling.

00:22:54.839 --> 00:22:55.960
Don't believe his bragging.

00:22:56.119 --> 00:22:57.920
And that sports car—

00:22:58.039 --> 00:22:59.519
it's all his boss's.

00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:01.480
He posts everything online.

00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:02.319
So shameless.

00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:05.960
So he's really your husband?

00:23:09.839 --> 00:23:10.319
Uh—

00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:13.759
Sorry, sorry, I—

00:23:13.759 --> 00:23:14.400
No need, no need.

00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:15.839
You don't have to apologize to me.

00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:17.400
He's the one who wronged me.

00:23:20.319 --> 00:23:22.039
So what are you going to do now?

00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:25.400
How about this—

00:23:25.799 --> 00:23:26.680
Tomorrow,

00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:27.799
you ask him out.

00:23:27.799 --> 00:23:28.680
Meet here.

00:23:28.759 --> 00:23:29.720
Then I'll come too.

00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:31.119
We'll both show up together.

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:32.240
Catch him red-handed.

00:23:33.359 --> 00:23:33.839
Okay.

00:23:45.079 --> 00:23:45.759
Meng Hang

00:23:48.799 --> 00:23:49.400
Meng Hang

00:23:49.799 --> 00:23:50.400
Meng Hang

00:23:51.279 --> 00:23:51.960
Meng Hang

00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:53.559
Mom

00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:54.440
Come quickly

00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:55.759
Meng Hang tried to kill himself. What happened?

00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:56.640
What's going on?

00:23:57.039 --> 00:23:57.599
Hurry up

00:23:57.759 --> 00:23:58.279
Dad, hurry up

00:23:58.279 --> 00:23:58.880
Hurry

00:23:59.000 --> 00:23:59.680
Son

00:23:59.799 --> 00:24:01.119
You lit all these candles?

00:24:01.279 --> 00:24:02.720
Open the window, quick! Open it!

00:24:02.799 --> 00:24:03.720
Hurry, open the window

00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:04.400
Son

00:24:04.799 --> 00:24:05.240
Son

00:24:05.599 --> 00:24:06.119
Son

00:24:06.599 --> 00:24:07.160
Son

00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:07.920
Son

00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:08.680
Wake up, quick

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:09.759
Son, wake up now

00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:10.440
Son

00:24:10.759 --> 00:24:11.240
Son

00:24:12.119 --> 00:24:12.720
Are you okay?

00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:18.200
You silly boy, what's wrong with you?

00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:20.039
I just asked you to make it up to her

00:24:20.119 --> 00:24:21.759
Why did you try to kill yourself to apologize?

00:24:21.759 --> 00:24:22.200
You—

00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:23.559
What's wrong with you?

00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:24.920
Li Li

00:24:26.039 --> 00:24:27.960
You're finally back

00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:30.240
I lit all the candles

00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:31.440
Closed the door and waited for you

00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:32.960
Wanted to surprise you

00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:35.319
Waited all night, but you never came

00:24:35.319 --> 00:24:36.240
The candles burned out

00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:37.279
I'm out of air too

00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:43.519
When did Meng get so romantic?

00:24:44.319 --> 00:24:47.240
From my two days as a relationship blogger

00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:48.920
If a man is suddenly nice to you

00:24:49.119 --> 00:24:50.519
It means he's feeling guilty

00:24:50.559 --> 00:24:51.720
Guilty about what?

00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:53.559
My son is just out of breath

00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:54.839
Son, ignore her

00:24:54.839 --> 00:24:55.559
Come on, come on

00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:56.880
Lie down on the bed for a bit

00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:57.559
Come on, come on

00:24:57.559 --> 00:24:58.119
It's okay

00:24:58.240 --> 00:24:58.720
Come on, come on

00:24:58.839 --> 00:24:59.400
Quick

00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:00.799
Come on, come on

00:25:00.799 --> 00:25:01.720
Lie down, lie down

00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:02.880
The window's open

00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:03.599
It's open, it's open

00:25:03.599 --> 00:25:04.160
Alright, alright

00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:05.519
The window's open, it's open

00:25:08.119 --> 00:25:09.640
What did you mean by "make it up"?

00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:10.480
Make it up to who?

00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:12.720
Make up for your lack of EQ

00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:13.920
My son, for your daughter

00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:15.079
got carbon monoxide poisoning

00:25:15.119 --> 00:25:16.200
Didn't you say you'd help out?

00:25:16.279 --> 00:25:18.240
And you still doubt my son

00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:19.279
When a man says

00:25:19.279 --> 00:25:20.720
"You doubt me?"

00:25:20.839 --> 00:25:22.000
Usually, you're right to doubt him

00:25:22.039 --> 00:25:23.039
We're not in the same class

00:25:23.039 --> 00:25:24.720
We're in Class Two, Year Three

00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:26.839
When a man starts yelling

00:25:27.039 --> 00:25:28.839
It means he's out of tricks

00:25:28.839 --> 00:25:30.519
You, you, you—

00:25:31.559 --> 00:25:32.000
You—

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:32.640
Alright, alright

00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:34.279
Mom, you two stop arguing

00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:36.200
We can handle this ourselves

00:25:36.319 --> 00:25:37.079
Go back for now

00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:37.960
Go to that room

00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:38.599
Go out, quick

00:25:38.599 --> 00:25:39.359
You two, don't—

00:25:39.359 --> 00:25:40.119
Not in this room either

00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:40.880
Just go

00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:41.400
Alright, alright

00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:42.039
It's fine

00:25:42.559 --> 00:25:43.319
You two handle it

00:25:43.319 --> 00:25:44.000
Don't worry, Dad

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.039
If you need me, just call

00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:45.799
Okay

00:25:50.799 --> 00:25:51.440
Li Li

00:26:18.759 --> 00:26:19.720
Miss

00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:22.680
Would you like to order now?

00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:24.440
I'm not ordering

00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:26.119
During peak dining hours

00:26:26.319 --> 00:26:28.200
You can't take a seat without ordering

00:26:29.039 --> 00:26:30.920
I'm with that girl

00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:31.720
She ordered

00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:32.400
That's fine

00:26:32.519 --> 00:26:33.240
Come, this way please

00:26:33.519 --> 00:26:34.119
No, no

00:26:35.039 --> 00:26:36.400
I can't sit at her table

00:26:40.519 --> 00:26:41.279
What? Huh?

00:26:41.519 --> 00:26:43.480
Aren't you two together?

00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:45.960
I'll order

00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:47.279
Give me a drink

00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:47.880
Okay

00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:49.079
What flavor would you like?

00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:50.839
New or traditional flavor?

00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:51.559
Um—

00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:52.680
Give me the hottest one

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:53.839
I need it for something later

00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:55.720
Okay

00:27:22.279 --> 00:27:24.200
AILISHASHA XIAOMAOMAO

00:27:24.759 --> 00:27:25.759
Brother Michael

00:27:25.839 --> 00:27:26.599
This is for you

00:27:27.759 --> 00:27:28.279
Yes

00:27:28.599 --> 00:27:29.559
I am Michael

00:27:31.359 --> 00:27:32.680
Why do I have to be called Michael

00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:34.279
You're Michael because

00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:35.640
Why are you "Michael" anyway

00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:36.880
Aren't you Lao Cha

00:27:41.799 --> 00:27:42.960
Meng Hang's wife

00:27:43.279 --> 00:27:43.960
We've met before

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:44.680
Let's talk over there, I...

00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:45.400
Sit down, please

00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:45.680
Come back

00:27:46.319 --> 00:27:47.119
This, this is...

00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:48.200
What are you doing here

00:27:48.519 --> 00:27:48.920
Me

00:27:49.079 --> 00:27:49.559
Here

00:27:50.559 --> 00:27:51.599
I'm on a date with my girlfriend

00:27:51.759 --> 00:27:53.160
Who's your girlfriend

00:27:53.359 --> 00:27:54.559
Isn't it better not to talk

00:27:55.079 --> 00:27:55.559
Getting shy now

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.279
Why do you call yourself Michael

00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:01.720
It's my username

00:28:02.319 --> 00:28:03.160
Just

00:28:03.519 --> 00:28:04.640
Like Michael Jordan

00:28:05.079 --> 00:28:06.119
Or Michael Jackson

00:28:06.279 --> 00:28:06.960
Michael

00:28:07.079 --> 00:28:07.799
Lao Cha, right

00:28:07.799 --> 00:28:08.920
Then in your profile

00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:11.039
Why are all the photos from Meng Hang

00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:16.920
Because I think his photos look good

00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:18.839
It's this angle

00:28:18.839 --> 00:28:20.119
It's just this vibe

00:28:20.119 --> 00:28:21.720
Creates some kind of artistic mood

00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:22.200
Just

00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:23.039
Looks nice

00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:25.359
So his profile pic is nice too

00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:26.880
Yeah

00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:28.319
It's good-looking

00:28:28.519 --> 00:28:30.720
And it's not just good-looking

00:28:31.039 --> 00:28:32.880
There's artistry in it too

00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:33.559
You know

00:28:33.559 --> 00:28:34.839
It's that artistic touch

00:28:34.839 --> 00:28:36.000
Speaking of artistry

00:28:36.039 --> 00:28:38.079
His best art is choosing you

00:28:38.079 --> 00:28:38.720
You're the best

00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:40.119
Come on, come on

00:28:40.559 --> 00:28:41.079
Show some respect

00:28:41.079 --> 00:28:41.519
Let me ask you

00:28:41.599 --> 00:28:43.559
Are you in an online romance

00:28:43.559 --> 00:28:45.200
Afraid people will find out you're a scumbag

00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:46.200
And then expose you

00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:48.079
So you use Meng Hang's profile

00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:48.799
That's narrow-minded

00:28:49.279 --> 00:28:51.319
That idea is just too narrow

00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:52.359
You're the type

00:28:52.559 --> 00:28:53.640
Who judges through a crack in the door

00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:55.039
You're underestimating me

00:28:55.039 --> 00:28:55.680
Is it really like that

00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:56.400
No, no, no

00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:57.759
Don't argue in the shop

00:28:57.759 --> 00:28:58.839
What's going on

00:28:58.839 --> 00:29:01.240
This scumbag used a fake identity to date me online

00:29:01.599 --> 00:29:02.039
No

00:29:02.079 --> 00:29:03.759
I thought it was no big deal

00:29:03.759 --> 00:29:05.160
There are too many scumbags now

00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:06.960
I met one in an online romance half a year ago

00:29:07.119 --> 00:29:08.839
He was sweet for two days then moved on

00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:10.160
Even blocked me on WeChat

00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:11.880
I'm not even surprised anymore

00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:13.039
Calm down, you two

00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:13.680
Go back and sit down

00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:14.279
No

00:29:14.519 --> 00:29:15.119
He

00:29:15.279 --> 00:29:17.160
Used my husband's profile for online dating

00:29:17.319 --> 00:29:18.640
Ruined our marriage

00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:19.359
Let me show you, come

00:29:19.799 --> 00:29:20.279
Look

00:29:20.559 --> 00:29:21.640
My husband took all these

00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:22.480
It's this one

00:29:22.759 --> 00:29:23.720
Michael

00:29:29.359 --> 00:29:30.079
Alright

00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:31.079
It's him

00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:32.599
He's the one who dumped me

00:29:32.599 --> 00:29:32.960
Long time no see

00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:33.480
Scumbag

00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:34.240
Hit him

00:29:34.319 --> 00:29:34.640
Hit him

00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:35.880
No, I lost my phone

00:29:36.079 --> 00:29:36.400
Scumbag

00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:36.920
See, you...

00:29:37.799 --> 00:29:43.440
Scumbag, scumbag, scumbag

00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:45.319
Let me explain

00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:46.400
Go ahead, explain

00:29:46.599 --> 00:29:47.720
Shouldn't we have a drink first

00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:48.400
Have a drink

00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:51.839
Scumbag

00:29:53.839 --> 00:29:54.920
What goes around comes around

00:30:09.079 --> 00:30:09.680
Meng Meng

00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:12.200
I've looked into everything

00:30:12.839 --> 00:30:13.559
Sorry

00:30:13.559 --> 00:30:14.759
I shouldn't have misunderstood you

00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:17.160
But it's all Lao Cha's fault at your company

00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:18.279
He was up to something outside

00:30:19.319 --> 00:30:20.039
What do you mean

00:30:21.839 --> 00:30:22.799
It's just before

00:30:22.799 --> 00:30:24.000
I thought you cheated

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.599
So I asked the girl out

00:30:25.599 --> 00:30:26.640
Then I found out Lao Cha

00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:29.039
Was using your info to trick girls

00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:30.519
Wait, wait a second

00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:31.920
Let me sort this out

00:30:33.599 --> 00:30:34.079
You

00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:36.640
Suspected I cheated

00:30:37.559 --> 00:30:38.559
Yes, because of Lao Cha

00:30:38.559 --> 00:30:40.200
And you investigated me

00:30:41.119 --> 00:30:42.119
Yes, I was just giving you...

00:30:42.119 --> 00:30:42.839
No, fine, fine

00:30:42.839 --> 00:30:43.240
Wait

00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:44.880
None of that matters now

00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:47.359
What matters is you doubted me

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:48.599
Li Li

00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:49.960
Do you know what matters most

00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:51.200
When two people are together

00:30:51.319 --> 00:30:52.599
It's trust

00:30:53.079 --> 00:30:54.519
When have I ever doubted you

00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:56.839
If I checked on you every day

00:30:57.160 --> 00:30:58.319
Would you feel good

00:31:09.279 --> 00:31:11.240
You yelled at me

00:31:12.039 --> 00:31:12.839
I didn't

00:31:14.839 --> 00:31:15.880
Didn't you

00:31:16.359 --> 00:31:17.079
No

00:31:17.759 --> 00:31:19.400
I've already given you a chance

00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:20.799
Are you going to lie to me again

00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:22.039
What did I lie about

00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:23.319
You clearly yelled at me

00:31:23.319 --> 00:31:24.799
You lied and said you didn't

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:25.400
I...

00:31:27.559 --> 00:31:28.240
I yelled at you

00:31:30.599 --> 00:31:32.119
You yell at me and lie to me

00:31:32.799 --> 00:31:34.039
You really don't love me

00:31:36.079 --> 00:31:37.000
No, Li Li

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:38.119
Listen to me

00:31:38.519 --> 00:31:39.440
Li Li, I was wrong

00:31:46.319 --> 00:31:46.759
How...

00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:48.880
How is it my fault again

00:31:56.559 --> 00:31:57.279
I think

00:31:57.599 --> 00:32:00.240
society has a logical flaw
about scumbags

00:32:00.319 --> 00:32:01.920
in its reasoning

00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:03.200
actually,

00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:04.799
all species are the same

00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:06.519
for example,

00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:07.759
take roses

00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:09.440
when the wind blows,

00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:12.720
male pollen scatters everywhere

00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:14.480
within a hundred meters,

00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:16.279
if it finds a female flower,

00:32:16.279 --> 00:32:17.200
they just combine

00:32:17.839 --> 00:32:19.000
so why does no one say

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:20.519
roses are scum flowers?

00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:21.119
right?

00:32:21.319 --> 00:32:23.039
they're still a symbol of love

00:32:23.799 --> 00:32:25.160
so I think

00:32:25.599 --> 00:32:27.279
humans are too harsh
on men

00:32:27.759 --> 00:32:28.640
way too harsh

00:32:29.519 --> 00:32:30.000
seriously

00:32:30.359 --> 00:32:32.039
go to hell, scumbag!

00:32:33.799 --> 00:32:36.119
weren't we not supposed
to hit the interviewee?

00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:37.839
help!

00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:39.559
Meng Hang!
