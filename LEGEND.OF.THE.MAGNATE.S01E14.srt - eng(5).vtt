[Legend of the Magnate]

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.920
[Episode 14]

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:40.150
Sir.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.759
When I went to the military camp
to rescue her,

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:44.509
I had already thought of

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:45.910
all 3 possible outcomes,

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:48.920
including this second situation

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:49.950
you mentioned.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.259
Here's what I thought:

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:54.420
as long as Yimei

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:55.630
could return safely,

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:57.870
she would still be your daughter

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:59.560
and still be my wife.

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:02.990
Being able to survive

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.260
in these chaotic times

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:06.450
is already difficult enough.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.470
To pursue accountability
for those things any further

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:10.530
would be too cruel.

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.800
You see, I'm a condemned official
of the imperial court myself,

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.660
someone who fled back from exile.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.079
If others start asking questions about me,

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.780
how is Yimei

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.590
supposed to face them?

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.079
Sir,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.150
I've always kept these thoughts to myself.

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.480
I only dared to say these out loud today
because you asked me.

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:37.829
If, by any chance, Yimei…

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:41.870
I hope

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.210
you can keep an open heart

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.290
and never blame her.

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.260
None of it would be her fault.

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.240
The wind is a bit strong.

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.670
It's making my eyes sting.

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.430
Before the merciful Guanyin Bodhisattva,

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.079
I, Bai Yimei, make this sincere prayer:

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:31.079
may the villagers of Shanjian Village

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:32.740
be spared from all suffering,

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.010
may there be no more famine,

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.230
and may the tea plantation be restored.

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.170
Please bless the entire village
with happiness and peace.

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.750
I pray that my father remains healthy

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:53.710
and protected from all harm,

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:56.980
and that Mrs. Gu and Pingyuan

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.250
may reunite as mother and son,

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:00.970
never to be separated again,

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.680
and may all their wishes come true.

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:10.430
Here.

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.150
You're breaking the rules
by bringing this here.

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:14.060
Put it away

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.810
before anyone else sees it.

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:23.010
Every night,
when your pain was at its worst,

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:26.360
I was here chanting sutras for you
to ease your suffering.

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.360
The Bodhisattva is merciful
and compassionate.

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.560
She responds to all who earnestly pray.

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.610
My injuries are mostly healed now.

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.620
What are you still praying to her for?

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.800
I'm praying that you can become
a good person.

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:50.680
A good person?

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.670
Back when we fought
in Huzhou and Hangzhou,

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.370
I was already the commanding general.

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:04.130
I can't even count

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.690
how many people died by my hand myself.

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:12.600
The Bodhisattva won't save me.

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:15.800
But I will.

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:19.070
I will.

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:23.160
I will.

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:37.000
If someone else

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:39.120
is about to be harmed,

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:43.210
and they call upon the name
of Guanyin Bodhisattva…

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:35.630
Go.

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:37.120
Open all those crates

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:37.980
in that corner.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:38.390
Yes.

00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:58.580
Come in with me.

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:06.560
Take a look.

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:10.510
See if there's anything among
all these treasures and jewelry

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:11.970
in this room that you like.

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:13.770
You can take whatever you want.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:14.870
So many?

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:15.830
Of course.

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:19.220
Waging war costs money.

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:20.510
I can't let my soldiers

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:21.510
live on air, can I?

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:23.920
Enough talk.

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:25.530
Hurry and pick something.

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:27.940
I don't want anything.

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:28.670
You don't?

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:31.580
But these are all valuable items.

00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:41.490
Check this out.

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:43.320
Beautiful, isn't it?

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:44.560
Keep it safe.

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:46.430
You might find it useful one day

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:47.630
when you get married.

00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:56.600
It's so pretty.

00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:00.040
I'll pick a few more items for you.

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:08.810
Where did this come from?

00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:09.870
Does it matter?

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:10.650
Just keep it.

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:12.950
The person who used to wear this headdress

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:14.190
must have been very beautiful,

00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:15.040
or else she wouldn't deserve

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:16.440
such exquisite jewelry.

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:18.800
Is she dead,

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:20.640
or did she escape?

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.120
Was she buried,

00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:24.990
or were her remains never found?

00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:28.430
I really don't know
whether the owner of this

00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:29.360
is dead or alive.

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:31.600
All these treasures in this room

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:33.169
were originally taken from
the common people

00:08:33.169 --> 00:08:34.510
by corrupt officials,

00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:36.200
and I confiscated them.

00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:38.130
Just take them.

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:40.590
You can certainly give me a gift,

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.860
as long as it truly belongs to you.

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:45.400
Belongs to me?

00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:50.320
All I have left is this last breath,

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:51.120
this one life—

00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:52.570
and I still need it

00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:53.700
to lead my troops.

00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:57.880
Just take it as doing me a favor.

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:00.870
If I cannot repay you for saving my life,

00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:02.130
I would die in anguish.

00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:03.390
Here.

00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:05.110
If you truly want to repay me,

00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:06.910
you need to take better care of yourself.

00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:07.720
This life of yours—

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:09.530
I worked day and night to save it.

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:11.170
Even if there were
mountains of gold and silver here,

00:09:11.170 --> 00:09:13.570
could any of it be worth
more than your life?

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:16.630
After you're fully healed,

00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:17.510
take me back,

00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:18.980
and we'll be even.

00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:35.500
I'll send you back today.

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:42.140
We're breaking camp.

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:47.910
Where to?

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:51.290
To attack Hefei.

00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:11.040
In a while,

00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:13.250
follow this mountain path

00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:14.490
westward

00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:15.720
and ride for 40 li.

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:17.960
I know the way.

00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:21.270
After you return,

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:22.510
don't speak of anything

00:10:22.510 --> 00:10:23.910
that happened in my camp,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.330
and especially don't tell anyone

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:26.860
that you treated my wounds.

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:29.240
Otherwise, the authorities will accuse you
of aiding the enemy,

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:30.980
and who knows what nonsense

00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:35.150
those simple‑minded villagers
of yours might make up about you.

00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:36.650
I'm not a child.

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:38.840
You don't have to worry about me.

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:40.910
Alright.

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:43.830
I have a request.

00:10:44.290 --> 00:10:45.150
Will you agree?

00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:48.350
What is it?

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:50.150
Still want me to become some good person

00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:51.480
who cherishes his life?

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:05.940
Put this on.

00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:16.240
This was left to me by my mother.

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:18.700
I hold it day and night
to pray for blessings,

00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:20.830
and I never let it leave my side.

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:30.630
It's just a pity

00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:32.550
that there's too much blood on my hands.

00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:33.750
Even if I wear it,

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:35.810
I'm still going to hell.

00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:38.870
Then I'll go

00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:40.440
visit you in hell.

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:21.680
Pingyuan!

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:22.720
Pingyuan!

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:24.510
What's wrong? Why are you running?

00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:25.970
Is there a dog chasing you?

00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:26.960
Bai...

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:29.050
Miss Bai is back!

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:31.740
Miss Bai is back!

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:37.800
It's Miss Bai! She's back!

00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:47.670
Auntie.

00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:52.550
Sister-in-law.

00:12:58.120 --> 00:12:58.670
Mr. Xu.

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:13.100
I'm back.

00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:20.510
Yimei!

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:26.570
Father.

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:28.730
-Father!
-My child!

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:29.550
Father!

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:37.030
Father.

00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:43.240
Father.

00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:47.410
Father.

00:13:54.850 --> 00:13:55.450
Yimei.

00:13:57.910 --> 00:13:59.040
It's windy out here.

00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:00.120
Let's talk inside.

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:02.020
Let's go home.

00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:02.590
Okay.

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:03.610
Let's go.

00:14:04.390 --> 00:14:05.190
Let's go home.

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:19.260
You can't delay this matter any longer.

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:20.670
[Blessings and Auspiciousness]

00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:22.390
Just call off the wedding right away.

00:14:22.390 --> 00:14:22.910
Besides,

00:14:22.910 --> 00:14:24.490
Pingwen's not married yet.

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:25.330
Right.

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:25.910
Don't end up

00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:27.120
dragging all of us down with you.

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:27.790
Besides, Pingyuan

00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:28.360
can't afford to

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:29.390
be arrested by the government again.

00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:30.080
He's here.

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:40.720
Go find out

00:14:40.750 --> 00:14:42.270
what people are saying outside.

00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:42.670
Hurry.

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:43.080
Yes.

00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:53.020
Miss Bai is back?

00:14:54.490 --> 00:14:55.960
You already heard, Mother?

00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:56.570
I was just about to

00:14:56.570 --> 00:14:58.230
share this good news with you.

00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:02.640
Mrs. Li and the others

00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:05.160
came over just now and told me about it.

00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:07.030
What did they say?

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:11.170
They said she...

00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:14.600
That she...

00:15:16.030 --> 00:15:17.030
What did they say?

00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:18.280
Why are you like this?

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:19.080
So fierce.

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:24.120
Mother.

00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:27.870
This time, it was only because
Yimei risked her life

00:15:27.870 --> 00:15:29.600
to treat that commanding general

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:30.510
that all the women in our village

00:15:30.510 --> 00:15:31.710
got to return safely.

00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:34.790
But just now,

00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:36.670
I noticed the looks
on those people's faces—

00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:38.120
they didn't seem friendly.

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:39.720
So I wondered what they said.

00:15:41.270 --> 00:15:42.440
They said she

00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:45.610
submitted herself

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:48.080
to the Southern Army's commanding general,

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:50.600
and that she might have come back
to take her father south

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:52.080
to enjoy a better life.

00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:58.480
Were you even raised by humans?

00:15:58.480 --> 00:15:59.720
What are you doing?

00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:01.610
Are you trying to eat someone now?

00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:07.260
It's not like that.

00:16:07.270 --> 00:16:08.470
Mother, listen to me.

00:16:10.510 --> 00:16:11.240
That commanding general

00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:13.240
was just one breath away from dying.

00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:15.510
If Yimei hadn't saved him,

00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:19.290
all the women in our village
would have been massacred.

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:20.240
That man was already injured

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:20.840
so badly

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:23.550
that even healing him
would be a waste of medicine.

00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:25.080
What could he possibly do
after he woke up?

00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:27.880
How could they say
she "submitted herself" to him?

00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:32.910
And all that talk about
running off to the south.

00:16:32.910 --> 00:16:34.370
Those despicable people,

00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:35.600
I wish I could just…

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:36.730
Wish you could what?

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:38.730
Kill them?

00:16:39.150 --> 00:16:40.980
Are you the same as they are?

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:41.440
No.

00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:43.480
But Mother, you have to trust Yimei.

00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:47.030
Yimei waited for me all these years.

00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:48.910
She's such a gentle, fragile woman,

00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:51.240
yet she stepped forward to save everyone.

00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:54.020
If that's not a heart of gold, what is?

00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:55.390
All right.

00:16:56.550 --> 00:16:57.570
All right.

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:00.480
But let me ask you this:

00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:02.500
if the government sends people here

00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:04.140
and they start asking questions,

00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:06.010
do you think they'll believe it?

00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:08.310
What if they accuse her of
aiding the enemy?

00:17:08.310 --> 00:17:09.109
What then?

00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:10.359
Those...

00:17:10.510 --> 00:17:11.500
Those soldiers

00:17:11.589 --> 00:17:12.400
don't care about

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:13.400
mercy or compassion.

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:15.599
They'll just grab onto her and kill her.

00:17:22.310 --> 00:17:22.960
Son,

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:25.640
if you trust her,

00:17:27.030 --> 00:17:28.190
then take

00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:30.440
Yimei and Mr. Bai

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:32.140
and leave as soon as possible.

00:17:35.790 --> 00:17:36.450
I won't go.

00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:40.730
I'm not going anywhere.

00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:45.750
I've finally made it back home.

00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:46.310
Mother,

00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:59.020
I don't want to leave your side
even for a moment.

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:03.060
I'm a person, not a tree.

00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:06.880
I don't want to be moved around anymore.

00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:12.140
Who's that?

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:13.650
Pingwen got into a fight!

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:32.920
Hit him! Hit him!

00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:34.240
Two against one, shameless!

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:35.000
Chop him up!

00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:36.110
Go away!

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:39.340
Stop it!

00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:43.230
Stop it!

00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:46.070
Get back here!

00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:47.440
Get back here!

00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:49.270
Come beat him up with me,

00:18:49.270 --> 00:18:49.870
Pingyuan.

00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:52.650
Listen to what they're saying!

00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:53.240
So what?

00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:54.860
Say that again if you dare!

00:18:57.380 --> 00:18:59.310
If they don't want to say it, leave it.

00:18:59.310 --> 00:18:59.970
You tell me.

00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:01.770
They said

00:19:02.030 --> 00:19:04.070
Miss Bai and that commanding general
had an affair.

00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:05.180
You filthy-mouthed bastard!

00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:05.980
Did you see it?

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.260
She was alone in the military camp.

00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:08.660
Who knows what happened?

00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:09.720
You should go back

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:10.850
and ask your own wife

00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:12.790
how she managed to come back.

00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:13.350
In the military camp,

00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:14.030
if Bai Yimei

00:19:14.030 --> 00:19:15.830
hadn't treated that commanding general,

00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:17.690
none of them would have returned.

00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:20.710
Each of you is big and strong,

00:19:21.550 --> 00:19:22.590
but where were you

00:19:22.610 --> 00:19:23.850
when your wives were being kidnapped?

00:19:23.850 --> 00:19:25.440
Did a single one of you
dare to step forward,

00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:27.100
even just to try and stop them?

00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:29.280
And now you gossip

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:31.090
behind their backs,

00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:33.560
slandering an innocent woman?

00:19:34.030 --> 00:19:35.360
What kind of men are you?

00:19:37.030 --> 00:19:37.560
Let's go.

00:19:39.030 --> 00:19:40.000
I'll beat you so bad

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:40.960
that even your own mother
won't recognize you!

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:43.440
She treated his wounds. How could there
possibly be nothing between them?

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:43.920
Tell me.

00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:45.200
Just like when there's meat
right in front of you,

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:47.260
which one of you wouldn't take a bite?

00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:52.940
I dare you to say that again!

00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:53.590
Let's go. Let's go.

00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:54.420
Pingyuan! Pingyuan!

00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:55.350
Pingyuan! Pingyuan!

00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:57.110
We can't afford to get involved in
a case where someone might die.

00:19:57.110 --> 00:19:57.590
You're not like me.

00:19:57.590 --> 00:20:00.650
Y-You don't know your own strength
when you hit people.

00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:16.640
Daughter,

00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:18.440
eat something.

00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:21.110
Open the door.

00:20:31.470 --> 00:20:34.530
If you listen to all that gossip,
where does it ever end?

00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:37.590
That's just how people are.

00:20:39.070 --> 00:20:41.270
No one's even running this country now,

00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:44.160
so who's going to bother
asking about your little issues?

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:45.290
Just eat something.

00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:46.640
Don't make me worry.

00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:49.240
Be good.

00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:51.570
Sir.

00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:56.480
Wait.

00:20:56.510 --> 00:20:57.110
You two brothers

00:20:57.110 --> 00:20:59.440
look like you just came off a battlefield.

00:20:59.550 --> 00:21:00.280
Wait, you...

00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:03.760
Sir, my mother requests your presence.

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:05.890
My mother requests your presence.

00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:07.600
I'll be there in a minute.

00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:09.170
Pingwen.

00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:10.240
Come here.

00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:11.290
Help me up.

00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:12.210
Let me help you.

00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:27.770
She won't come out.

00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:30.770
Keep an eye on her for me.

00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:33.100
Don't let her commit suicide.

00:21:35.310 --> 00:21:36.040
Understood.

00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:40.460
Pingwen.

00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:41.880
Let's go.

00:21:52.830 --> 00:21:53.530
Yimei.

00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:56.210
Yimei!

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:58.010
Open the door.

00:22:00.110 --> 00:22:02.400
Do you really want to
break your father's heart?

00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:03.660
We can talk things out.

00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:04.960
Why shut the door?

00:22:05.790 --> 00:22:06.400
Yimei!

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:21.640
I know

00:22:22.110 --> 00:22:23.510
you feel upset right now.

00:22:25.550 --> 00:22:26.150
Talk to me.

00:22:27.550 --> 00:22:28.410
I'm listening.

00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:31.490
What's there to talk about?

00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:32.790
No one will believe me.

00:22:32.790 --> 00:22:33.600
I will.

00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:35.310
I believe you.

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:39.600
I've seen with my own eyes
how brave you are.

00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:40.440
Yimei.

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:42.000
Between us,

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.310
there's no need to ask
whether I believe you or not.

00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:45.880
If I had known things would
turn out like this,

00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:48.680
I might as well have just died
in the military camp.

00:22:49.310 --> 00:22:50.440
Don't say things out of anger.

00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:51.750
I'm not saying it out of anger.

00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:53.290
What is it then?

00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:55.000
Let me ask you.

00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:57.170
If you had the chance again,

00:22:57.550 --> 00:22:58.240
would you

00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:00.040
still step forward to save them?

00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:02.050
In these chaotic times,

00:23:02.150 --> 00:23:03.350
since when has saving people

00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:05.020
ever come with the expectation
of getting anything in return?

00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:06.480
Would you stop saving them

00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:08.940
just because they don't appreciate you?

00:23:12.750 --> 00:23:13.510
I know.

00:23:14.790 --> 00:23:16.290
But I'm just so angry.

00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:19.280
I understand.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.310
Human hearts can be so cruel

00:23:22.310 --> 00:23:24.110
that even dogs won't touch them.

00:23:24.350 --> 00:23:25.270
Back in Ningguta,

00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:26.000
I thought

00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:29.030
everything would be fine
if I could just get out.

00:23:29.030 --> 00:23:30.760
But only after coming back here

00:23:31.310 --> 00:23:33.170
did I realize life is even harder.

00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:34.830
Compared to those

00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:36.230
passionate men in exile,

00:23:36.830 --> 00:23:37.890
the people here...

00:23:50.550 --> 00:23:51.420
Gu.

00:23:53.070 --> 00:23:54.600
I haven't even asked you yet

00:23:55.420 --> 00:23:56.860
how your years

00:23:56.890 --> 00:23:57.910
in exile were,

00:23:58.750 --> 00:24:00.950
and here you are, asking about me first.

00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:04.180
How could they possibly have been good?

00:24:04.550 --> 00:24:05.950
In my first year of exile,

00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:07.470
I was sent to pan for gold.

00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:10.640
The ice on the river hadn't even melted,

00:24:10.750 --> 00:24:12.230
and when I put my feet in,

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:14.280
it felt like 10,000 needles

00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:15.880
piercing the tops of my feet.

00:24:16.350 --> 00:24:17.550
That feeling was like

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:19.660
dying and coming back to life.

00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:22.250
But I always had one belief.

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:24.200
I told myself

00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:25.930
that as long as I'm still alive,

00:24:26.070 --> 00:24:26.750
I'd have a chance

00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:27.880
to see you all again.

00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:31.080
You've suffered so much.

00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:32.510
Yimei.

00:24:33.790 --> 00:24:35.250
Staying alive isn't easy,

00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:37.960
and meeting again is even harder.

00:24:39.270 --> 00:24:40.610
Your father just told me

00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:43.360
he's worried you might take your own life.

00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:45.790
Do you know during these days
you were taken away,

00:24:45.790 --> 00:24:46.680
he practically lost half his life

00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:47.880
from the worry?

00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:51.030
Now that you're back, are you going to
keep making him worry?

00:24:51.030 --> 00:24:53.960
Do you really not care about
his well-being anymore?

00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:57.880
I understand now.

00:24:59.510 --> 00:25:00.920
I was being childish.

00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:07.160
Yimei.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:10.190
Back there,

00:25:11.310 --> 00:25:12.070
I often lay alone

00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:13.110
in the snow,

00:25:13.550 --> 00:25:14.950
watching the snowflakes

00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:15.960
slowly covering me

00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:16.960
like a blanket.

00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:19.680
I would look up at the sky

00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:22.750
and wonder,

00:25:23.790 --> 00:25:25.510
under this same sky,

00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:27.290
what were you all doing?

00:25:30.590 --> 00:25:31.400
Perhaps

00:25:32.310 --> 00:25:33.640
you were already awake,

00:25:34.790 --> 00:25:35.650
boiling water,

00:25:37.110 --> 00:25:38.970
preparing to make tea for Mr. Bai.

00:25:41.310 --> 00:25:42.750
Perhaps those children

00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:45.700
were noisily arriving at the classroom,

00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:47.960
and you had to tap each of them
on the head

00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:49.550
with your little pointer

00:25:49.750 --> 00:25:52.680
before they'd settle down
and recite their lessons.

00:25:52.750 --> 00:25:53.590
Gu...

00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:55.000
Yimei.

00:26:10.790 --> 00:26:11.670
Gu.

00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:16.000
I won't upset my father anymore.

00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:20.950
I need some time alone
to think things through.

00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:23.410
There's just too much going on.

00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:25.510
I-I'm going to rest now.

00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:56.030
In-law.

00:26:57.240 --> 00:26:59.030
Rumors cut like knives.

00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:03.200
I fear my daughter has been torn apart.

00:27:04.790 --> 00:27:06.590
I tried to persuade him just now.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.120
I told him to take

00:27:09.690 --> 00:27:11.800
you and Yimei

00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:13.790
and run far away from here,

00:27:14.510 --> 00:27:15.940
but he actually refused.

00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:18.480
I'm at my wit's end.

00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:21.140
Please try talking to him.

00:27:24.070 --> 00:27:26.660
I can talk to him,
but who's going to talk to me?

00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:29.080
Besides, even if we run away,

00:27:29.110 --> 00:27:30.510
what about you and Pingwen?

00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:31.300
You would certainly

00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:33.020
be implicated.

00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:35.000
If we all leave,

00:27:35.030 --> 00:27:36.350
our ancestors' graves are still here,

00:27:36.350 --> 00:27:37.000
our land is still here,

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:37.830
and our tea plantation is still here—

00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:39.240
who will take care of them?

00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:40.550
Even if we escape,

00:27:40.790 --> 00:27:42.780
where could we possibly settle?

00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:44.100
Do you expect me, at my age,

00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:47.100
to make a living
by kneeling on the ground and begging?

00:27:51.660 --> 00:27:53.880
[Blessings and Auspiciousness]

00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:55.260
Mother, Mr. Bai.

00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:56.000
Pingwen,

00:27:56.920 --> 00:27:58.120
go boil some water

00:27:58.350 --> 00:27:59.890
to make tea for Mr. Bai.

00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:06.340
Pingyuan.

00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:10.160
I've just been discussing with Mr. Bai

00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:12.550
and want to hear your thoughts.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:14.330
My thoughts about what?

00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:21.900
Mother.

00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:22.970
Please sit down.

00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:28.250
Take Yimei

00:28:28.750 --> 00:28:29.480
and run away.

00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:32.050
Mother.

00:28:32.050 --> 00:28:32.960
We've already talked about this,
haven't we?

00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:34.290
I'm not going anywhere.

00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:35.510
If Yimei runs away,

00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:37.240
what do you expect Mr. Bai to do?

00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:38.110
If I run away,

00:28:38.110 --> 00:28:39.440
who will take care of you?

00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:41.160
We still have our tea plantation,

00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:42.420
and I promised Pingwen

00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:43.960
that I would teach him business.

00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:45.800
S-Sure, Pingyuan. I'll go.

00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:47.040
Go where?

00:28:47.070 --> 00:28:48.330
Where do you want to go?

00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:50.060
Fine, let's go.

00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:52.070
Take Mr. Bai and Mother with us,

00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:53.880
and our whole family will leave together.

00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:55.560
Why are you so stubborn?

00:28:56.550 --> 00:28:57.110
Mother.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:59.750
Didn't you ask about my thoughts?

00:28:59.750 --> 00:29:00.810
I do have a thought.

00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:07.150
Then go ahead and tell us.

00:29:08.270 --> 00:29:09.270
I've thought it through.

00:29:09.270 --> 00:29:09.810
I want to marry Yimei

00:29:09.810 --> 00:29:10.940
openly and proudly.

00:29:13.790 --> 00:29:16.450
Even though neither of our families
is wealthy,

00:29:16.510 --> 00:29:17.160
I'll make sure this wedding

00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:18.420
is properly arranged.

00:29:18.830 --> 00:29:20.490
I want the whole village to see

00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:22.330
that I am her man.

00:29:24.810 --> 00:29:26.210
I know that in this world,

00:29:26.750 --> 00:29:27.720
as long as Yimei understands me

00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:28.920
and I understand her,

00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:29.780
that's enough.

00:29:30.110 --> 00:29:32.040
What does it matter to anyone else?

00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:33.920
When it's time to harvest and roast tea,

00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:35.270
everyone will be busy working

00:29:35.270 --> 00:29:37.780
and won't have the time
to spread this kind of gossip.

00:29:37.780 --> 00:29:39.160
But if we run away,

00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:40.830
then we're practically

00:29:40.830 --> 00:29:42.270
confirming these rumors.

00:29:42.270 --> 00:29:42.720
They'll think

00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:43.640
we're guilty,

00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:44.440
that we're scared—

00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:46.210
that we fled
because we had something to hide.

00:29:46.210 --> 00:29:47.030
Who knows, they might even start saying
behind our backs

00:29:47.030 --> 00:29:49.030
that our whole family are traitors.

00:29:52.370 --> 00:29:54.100
We really were muddle‑headed.

00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:57.160
The two of us nearly harmed our kids.

00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:01.530
You always have a basketful of reasons.

00:30:01.530 --> 00:30:02.940
No one can outtalk you.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.060
Even if everything you said is right,

00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:05.940
how many years do Mr. Bai and I

00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:07.460
have left to live?

00:30:09.070 --> 00:30:11.130
What truly matters is that you and Yimei

00:30:11.130 --> 00:30:12.590
live a good life together.

00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:13.720
Mother,

00:30:14.590 --> 00:30:16.190
a good life for Yimei and me

00:30:16.550 --> 00:30:18.610
means taking good care of you

00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:20.700
and Mr. Bai at home.

00:30:21.270 --> 00:30:21.940
Mr. Bai,

00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:23.770
do you agree with me?

00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:31.960
Dear sis.

00:30:34.030 --> 00:30:35.310
In-law.

00:30:36.310 --> 00:30:37.120
This time,

00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:38.970
I won't be listening to you.

00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:39.680
Back when I taught him to read

00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:40.680
when he was a kid,

00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:41.270
I knew

00:30:41.310 --> 00:30:42.240
this child is strong-willed.

00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:43.750
No one could win an argument with him.

00:30:43.750 --> 00:30:44.350
Let's just

00:30:44.830 --> 00:30:46.510
listen to him.

00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:49.070
I'll go back and cheer Yimei up,

00:30:49.310 --> 00:30:51.250
and help her prepare her dowry.

00:30:52.750 --> 00:30:54.160
Sir, you're a wise man.

00:30:56.820 --> 00:30:57.550
Pingyuan.

00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:12.340
Pingwen.

00:31:12.550 --> 00:31:13.920
Come down the mountain with me

00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:15.450
to buy the betrothal gifts.

00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:27.680
This sedan chair is way too small.

00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:29.550
It might work for carrying a cat,

00:31:29.550 --> 00:31:30.950
but can it carry a person?

00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:33.960
Well, just for carrying the bride
for a little while,

00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:35.230
it'll do just fine.

00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:36.750
If it were to carry you, Sir,

00:31:36.750 --> 00:31:38.410
it definitely wouldn't work.

00:31:39.110 --> 00:31:40.570
Well, the two-bearer sedan chairs

00:31:40.570 --> 00:31:41.700
are just this small.

00:31:41.790 --> 00:31:42.960
If you have enough money,

00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:45.220
let's go check out the four-bearer ones.

00:31:59.750 --> 00:32:01.080
It truly is a bit bigger.

00:32:02.970 --> 00:32:03.790
But my money

00:32:03.790 --> 00:32:05.450
has been carefully budgeted:

00:32:05.790 --> 00:32:07.270
1 small two-bearer sedan chair,

00:32:07.270 --> 00:32:08.650
6 musicians, 2 attendants,

00:32:08.650 --> 00:32:09.350
2 matrons to escort the bride,

00:32:09.350 --> 00:32:10.070
2 matrons to receive her,

00:32:10.070 --> 00:32:10.750
and 12 tables for the banquet.

00:32:10.750 --> 00:32:11.720
Nothing can be missing.

00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:12.790
Don't mess this up for me.

00:32:12.790 --> 00:32:13.790
Rest assured, Sir.

00:32:13.790 --> 00:32:14.910
Our sedan chairs

00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:16.070
are in perfect condition.

00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:17.270
The bearers need to shave their heads.

00:32:17.270 --> 00:32:18.410
N-No problem.

00:32:18.750 --> 00:32:20.110
And their clothes have to be new.

00:32:20.110 --> 00:32:20.770
Certainly.

00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:23.440
Peace is just around the corner.

00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:24.610
How could I possibly

00:32:24.830 --> 00:32:26.700
overcharge you shamelessly?

00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:32.280
This one it is.

00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:33.060
No problem!

00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:44.210
The medicine got burnt.

00:33:25.070 --> 00:33:25.690
Sir,

00:33:25.850 --> 00:33:27.830
all the invitations have been sent out.

00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:28.400
I've also spoken with

00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:29.960
the cooks down the mountain.

00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:30.630
I think

00:33:30.790 --> 00:33:32.790
we should still keep things frugal.

00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:34.960
Yes, absolutely.

00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:41.200
Is she... Alright?

00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:44.510
She's perfectly healthy.

00:33:44.510 --> 00:33:45.640
Why wouldn't she be?

00:33:48.070 --> 00:33:49.360
She's just being shy.

00:33:49.550 --> 00:33:52.440
As a young girl, hearing things like this,
it's only natural.

00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:53.620
If this were in the past,
the moment you arrived,

00:33:53.620 --> 00:33:55.380
she would've come rushing out.

00:33:55.550 --> 00:33:56.590
But look at her now.

00:33:56.590 --> 00:33:58.590
She won't even bring you a cup of tea.

00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:05.820
Ask her to fill my cup.

00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:51.920
Mr. Bai asked me to get some water.

00:35:05.710 --> 00:35:06.960
That general Li...

00:35:09.070 --> 00:35:10.930
He didn't hit or scold you, did he?

00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:13.900
No.

00:35:17.190 --> 00:35:18.720
Why would he hit or scold me?

00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:20.740
He put you through so much.

00:35:21.070 --> 00:35:23.000
I get angry just thinking about it.

00:35:25.550 --> 00:35:27.010
What are you trying to say?

00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:36.760
Yimei.

00:35:37.550 --> 00:35:39.480
Do you have something on your mind?

00:35:39.550 --> 00:35:40.810
I don't know how to ask.

00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:44.630
I don't.

00:35:54.510 --> 00:35:55.640
Don't we...

00:35:56.150 --> 00:35:58.210
Have some unfinished conversation?

00:36:27.190 --> 00:36:28.590
Pingyuan, are you tired?

00:36:29.250 --> 00:36:31.380
Why don't you go back
and rest for a bit?

00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:36.880
You seem quite distracted these days.

00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:37.740
What happened?

00:36:47.230 --> 00:36:48.360
I just have a feeling

00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:51.050
that Yimei has changed.

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:54.120
In my memory,

00:36:54.710 --> 00:36:56.110
Yimei hardly ever spoke.

00:36:57.030 --> 00:36:58.580
When she did say something,

00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:00.320
it was always soft and gentle,

00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:01.520
with a delicate tone.

00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:03.930
But now, she's become...

00:37:05.190 --> 00:37:06.120
Very assertive.

00:37:07.170 --> 00:37:08.320
The things she says

00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:09.960
seem logical on the surface,

00:37:10.230 --> 00:37:10.880
but when you think carefully,

00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:12.440
something's off about them,

00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:14.100
yet I can't seem to refute her.

00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:18.840
That's what happens
when someone's seen the world.

00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:20.070
Not to mention her—

00:37:20.110 --> 00:37:21.360
just take myself as an example.

00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:23.360
These days, I brag to everyone I meet

00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:25.070
that my brother and I
charged in and out of

00:37:25.070 --> 00:37:26.530
the military camp 7 times,

00:37:26.670 --> 00:37:27.970
no worse than Zhao Yun

00:37:28.070 --> 00:37:29.800
and even better than Zhang Fei.

00:37:30.030 --> 00:37:31.760
What nonsense you're talking.

00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:33.850
The key issue is,

00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:35.520
I just feel

00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:37.000
the way she talks to me now

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:38.140
is too polite.

00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:40.070
What do you mean by too polite?

00:37:40.070 --> 00:37:41.110
She's just very courteous

00:37:41.110 --> 00:37:42.040
and very formal.

00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:44.600
I feel like I can't get close to her,

00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:46.530
like there's a barrier between us.

00:37:46.710 --> 00:37:48.770
Now you're just being unreasonable.

00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:51.150
You've been gone for so many years

00:37:51.150 --> 00:37:52.210
and just came back,

00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:52.840
and with such a major incident

00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:54.320
having just happened to her family—

00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:56.000
how close do you expect her
to be with you?

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:57.060
It's not like that.

00:37:57.320 --> 00:37:58.360
We've known each other since childhood

00:37:58.360 --> 00:37:59.150
and grown up together.

00:37:59.150 --> 00:37:59.710
How could I not know

00:37:59.710 --> 00:38:00.590
what kind of person she is?

00:38:00.590 --> 00:38:01.790
Well, like last time,

00:38:02.070 --> 00:38:03.070
I risked my life

00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:04.710
to rescue her from the military camp.

00:38:04.710 --> 00:38:06.480
But as soon as she saw me,
she asked me to leave first,

00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:07.190
saying she wanted to stay

00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:08.840
and save those wounded soldiers.

00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:10.280
It's been even worse since she came back.

00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:11.480
The way she looks at me

00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:13.240
is like we're strangers.

00:38:14.590 --> 00:38:16.250
Well, not exactly strangers,

00:38:16.630 --> 00:38:17.190
just slightly better

00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:18.450
than total strangers.

00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:32.490
Now that Suzhou and Hangzhou
have been captured,

00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:34.230
I couldn't get any

00:38:34.230 --> 00:38:35.630
good silk fabrics at all.

00:38:36.110 --> 00:38:37.040
Those silk shops

00:38:37.070 --> 00:38:38.870
are only selling foreign stuff—

00:38:39.070 --> 00:38:40.590
they all looked like funeral clothes.

00:38:40.590 --> 00:38:41.860
I wandered around for two days

00:38:41.860 --> 00:38:43.260
and couldn't buy a thing.

00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:46.620
I only managed to get some silver jewelry
in the end.

00:38:48.590 --> 00:38:50.520
What about the wedding dress then?

00:38:52.110 --> 00:38:54.030
A girl needs a red wedding dress

00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:55.590
when she gets married

00:38:55.590 --> 00:38:56.760
no matter what.

00:38:59.110 --> 00:39:01.570
You can't have her wear
plain cloth, can you?

00:39:02.630 --> 00:39:04.440
Even if Mr. Bai agrees,

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:05.980
Miss Bai

00:39:06.230 --> 00:39:07.880
would be furious with you.

00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:09.560
Mother.

00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:11.440
When you got married,

00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:13.300
could you afford a wedding dress?

00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:26.990
Speaking of my wedding dress,

00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:33.230
back then, there were hardly

00:39:33.230 --> 00:39:35.290
any villages that hadn't heard of it.

00:39:38.150 --> 00:39:40.070
It was made of fine Suzhou silk,

00:39:42.060 --> 00:39:43.660
and the buttons were coral.

00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:47.230
That red color was a bit deeper

00:39:47.230 --> 00:39:49.430
than the red of normal wedding dresses.

00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:52.400
The skirt I wore

00:39:53.070 --> 00:39:54.910
had Fushan longevity pattern,

00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:56.690
embroidered with sea monsters

00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:00.150
holding jewels in their hands,

00:40:02.510 --> 00:40:03.510
which were actually stitched

00:40:03.510 --> 00:40:05.590
with real gems.

00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:07.570
Mother,

00:40:07.670 --> 00:40:08.230
are you...

00:40:08.230 --> 00:40:10.340
You think I'm crazy

00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:12.700
and talking nonsense, don't you?

00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:15.130
No, of course not.

00:40:21.550 --> 00:40:23.080
Later, I found out

00:40:24.630 --> 00:40:25.590
that your father

00:40:26.150 --> 00:40:28.840
sold his collection of
paintings and calligraphy.

00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:30.110
He liked things to be

00:40:30.920 --> 00:40:32.180
dignified and lively,

00:40:32.590 --> 00:40:34.650
and he didn't want me to feel wronged.

00:40:41.110 --> 00:40:42.910
Father treated you really well.

00:40:46.670 --> 00:40:48.930
I'm not asking you to be like your father.

00:40:49.510 --> 00:40:51.310
I was young and naive back then.

00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:52.600
Actually,

00:40:53.880 --> 00:40:55.250
wearing a simple wedding dress

00:40:55.250 --> 00:40:56.450
would have been fine.

00:40:58.710 --> 00:41:00.230
Insisting on things we shouldn't have

00:41:00.230 --> 00:41:01.490
often brings trouble.

00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:04.010
That's true.

00:41:05.030 --> 00:41:06.200
Yimei isn't picky,

00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:08.930
so I think a plain cloth dress would do.

00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:10.080
Really?

00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:15.760
Don't look at me like that.

00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:16.360
It's true.

00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:21.220
But you have to ask her.

00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:24.290
No matter how much a girl likes you,

00:41:24.550 --> 00:41:25.880
if you can't even provide
a decent wedding dress

00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:26.950
for her to wear,

00:41:27.510 --> 00:41:30.110
and she doesn't even complain,
something must be off.

00:41:30.110 --> 00:41:31.920
It's not that she didn't complain.

00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:33.760
She... She just didn't say
anything at all.

00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:34.960
I think...

00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:38.400
If you ask me, getting married

00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:40.430
is the last thing on her mind now.

00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:43.480
Give it some time.

00:41:44.230 --> 00:41:46.660
Follow her lead and give it some time.

00:41:47.150 --> 00:41:48.150
But Mr. Bai's health

00:41:48.150 --> 00:41:49.030
is getting worse and worse.

00:41:49.030 --> 00:41:49.650
Son.

00:41:50.190 --> 00:41:52.630
Parents are only matters
for half a lifetime,

00:41:52.630 --> 00:41:54.630
but a spouse is for a whole lifetime.

00:41:55.460 --> 00:41:57.220
Don't try to make us happy.

00:41:58.230 --> 00:42:02.230
What truly matters is that the two of you
live a fulfilled life together.

00:42:13.710 --> 00:42:14.170
Father.

00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:16.290
Father, what are you doing?

00:42:21.320 --> 00:42:23.000
Dear, hold my legs.

00:42:23.030 --> 00:42:24.410
Hold my legs.

00:42:25.190 --> 00:42:26.920
Father, come down. I'll get it.

00:42:30.670 --> 00:42:31.330
Never mind.

00:42:32.150 --> 00:42:32.960
Help me down.

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:33.440
Okay.

00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:36.360
I'm really useless.

00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:45.110
Father, what were you doing?

00:42:45.110 --> 00:42:46.920
If you need anything,
I can get it for you.

00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:48.360
You don't have the strength for that.

00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:48.840
Call the Gu brothers over

00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:50.560
in a bit

00:42:50.670 --> 00:42:52.200
and have them help me get it.

00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:53.650
All of these are the dowry

00:42:53.650 --> 00:42:54.990
I've been saving for you over the years.
