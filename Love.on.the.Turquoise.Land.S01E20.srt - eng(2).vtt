Dr. Lv, what's wrong?

00:10:10.536 --> 00:10:11.776
I went for a home consultation.

00:10:11.857 --> 00:10:13.896
Just dropped off some tonic herbs
for Ms. Lin.

00:10:14.536 --> 00:10:16.776
Ms. Lin is not here.
I'll pass them to her.

Ms. Lin is not here.

00:10:28.737 --> 00:10:30.176
Can't I visit others?

00:10:34.337 --> 00:10:35.617
Perfect timing.

00:10:36.377 --> 00:10:38.536
Today, Ms. Lin is not here.

00:10:38.656 --> 00:10:40.737
I don't want to eat alone.

00:10:41.296 --> 00:10:42.056

00:10:42.457 --> 00:10:44.176
Please keep Dr. Lv for dinner.

Don't exhaust yourself.

I'll just finish up any leftovers.

00:12:15.696 --> 00:12:16.416
This is too much.

00:12:17.217 --> 00:12:18.936
Can't you just make simple dishes?

00:12:24.457 --> 00:12:26.457
Since Ms. Lin is away, sit down and eat.

00:12:26.737 --> 00:12:27.457
Heard me?

00:12:27.977 --> 00:12:28.656
Just be casual.

00:12:28.656 --> 00:12:29.337
No need.

00:12:32.296 --> 00:12:32.896
Fine.

00:12:39.457 --> 00:12:41.017
I never realized this table was huge.

00:12:41.776 --> 00:12:43.776
Ms. Lin's presence dominated the space.

00:12:44.337 --> 00:12:45.176
Now look.

00:12:47.656 --> 00:12:48.457
People always say,

00:12:49.296 --> 00:12:50.617
"Comfort beats a full meal."

00:12:52.017 --> 00:12:53.857
This table is big enough
to eat lying down.

00:13:02.497 --> 00:13:06.457
You mentioned
practicing pour-over coffee.

00:13:06.737 --> 00:13:07.857
How's it going?

00:13:08.017 --> 00:13:10.056
Forget it. I gave up.

00:13:11.257 --> 00:13:13.936
I couldn't even maintain
the proper water temperature.

00:13:14.656 --> 00:13:15.857
Taste was even worse.

00:13:16.617 --> 00:13:17.257
True.

00:13:17.776 --> 00:13:19.936
I brew coffee at Wanbao Tower.

00:13:19.936 --> 00:13:21.936
It always ends up
tasting like herbal residue.

00:13:22.377 --> 00:13:23.536
Forget it. I can't master it.

00:13:24.017 --> 00:13:25.337
I'll just drink

00:13:25.337 --> 00:13:26.617
the coffee from coffee maker.

00:13:29.176 --> 00:13:31.056
Guess you influenced me.

00:13:31.776 --> 00:13:34.656
Lately I've been obsessed with mixology.

00:13:37.497 --> 00:13:38.536
Got such a refined hobby?

00:13:39.536 --> 00:13:41.337
Ms. Lin has every liquor here.

00:13:41.857 --> 00:13:43.137
I just mix it for fun.

00:13:43.576 --> 00:13:44.497
I don't drink it,

00:13:45.337 --> 00:13:47.776
but enjoy mixing it.

00:13:48.497 --> 00:13:50.017
It feels good when doing it.

00:13:50.017 --> 00:13:50.656
Right?

00:13:52.776 --> 00:13:55.017
Any single bottle
from Ms. Lin's collection

00:13:55.017 --> 00:13:56.377
costs half my monthly earnings.

00:13:56.377 --> 00:13:57.416
Yet you mix it for fun?

00:13:57.416 --> 00:13:58.416
What a waste!

00:14:00.217 --> 00:14:01.257
I'll mix one for you.

00:14:01.696 --> 00:14:02.377
Now?

00:14:06.017 --> 00:14:08.977
Comfort beats a full meal.

00:14:09.576 --> 00:14:12.056
It's perfect
to get one drink with dishes.

00:14:15.776 --> 00:14:16.457
Just wait.

00:14:19.056 --> 00:14:20.816
Wait, don't pour so much.

00:14:20.816 --> 00:14:21.857
I don't hold my liquor.

00:14:28.936 --> 00:14:29.617
Peng.

00:14:31.137 --> 00:14:31.936
Come on.

00:14:34.617 --> 00:14:35.816
How much is your salary?

00:14:35.936 --> 00:14:37.017
You're so principled.

00:14:45.857 --> 00:14:49.017
Since when did you start liking this?

00:14:51.857 --> 00:14:54.936
Do you think I truly like it?

00:14:56.217 --> 00:14:57.097
What do you mean?

00:15:01.696 --> 00:15:03.176
What do you

00:15:04.137 --> 00:15:05.497
think of Lv Xian?

00:15:09.137 --> 00:15:12.457
Ms. Lin is always right.

00:15:16.696 --> 00:15:17.816
I didn't

00:15:18.056 --> 00:15:19.536
like him at first,

00:15:21.416 --> 00:15:23.017
but after spending time together,

00:15:24.097 --> 00:15:26.017
I felt he's quite approachable.

00:15:26.896 --> 00:15:28.896
Dr. Lv has always been easygoing.

00:15:32.857 --> 00:15:34.737
I wonder how well he holds his liquor.

00:15:37.776 --> 00:15:38.816
How much wine

00:15:39.617 --> 00:15:40.776
can get him drunk

00:15:41.776 --> 00:15:43.176
and let him stay tonight?

00:16:11.857 --> 00:16:12.576
Sis.

00:16:15.097 --> 00:16:18.056
Did you change my bedsheets?

00:16:39.257 --> 00:16:39.977
What's wrong?

00:16:40.977 --> 00:16:41.737
Let me check.

00:17:24.376 --> 00:17:25.417
Why are you parking here?

00:17:26.336 --> 00:17:26.977
What's wrong?

00:17:30.296 --> 00:17:31.217
Drive away now!

00:17:33.217 --> 00:17:34.977
Can't you see the "No Parking" sign?

00:17:37.657 --> 00:17:40.737
Open your eyes to see,
or I'll pluck them out.

00:17:41.257 --> 00:17:43.217
Keep your mouth shut,
or I'll rip it apart.

00:17:51.257 --> 00:17:51.816
What now?

00:17:52.897 --> 00:17:53.776
Don't touch me.

00:17:58.096 --> 00:18:00.217
Don't pull on tricks. I'm warning you.

00:18:11.737 --> 00:18:12.457
Goodbye, Miss.

00:18:12.457 --> 00:18:13.457
Okay, goodbye.

00:18:16.017 --> 00:18:16.576
Hello.

00:18:17.096 --> 00:18:17.697

I said don't touch me.

00:21:30.336 --> 00:21:31.257
Don't touch me.

00:21:34.217 --> 00:21:35.497
I told you.

00:21:39.697 --> 00:21:41.497
It's okay.

00:21:44.776 --> 00:21:45.417
It's okay.

00:21:48.697 --> 00:21:49.776

00:21:50.136 --> 00:21:50.897

00:22:23.457 --> 00:22:25.056
and find their own style.

00:22:25.616 --> 00:22:27.336
Otherwise, at their age,

00:22:27.336 --> 00:22:28.937
they'd end up with improper imitation.

00:22:31.296 --> 00:22:34.336
Improper imitation?

00:22:36.136 --> 00:22:37.136
I remember a saying.

00:22:37.136 --> 00:22:39.657
It's difficult

00:22:40.096 --> 00:22:42.376
to draw common things well.

00:22:46.816 --> 00:22:47.417
Indeed.

00:22:48.737 --> 00:22:51.856
It's difficult to draw

00:22:51.977 --> 00:22:53.136
common things from life well.

00:22:53.296 --> 00:22:55.257
Because the slightest deviation

00:22:55.336 --> 00:22:56.296
gets noticed easily.

00:22:57.576 --> 00:22:58.897
You're absolutely right.

00:23:00.056 --> 00:23:02.536
It's difficult to imitate human.

00:23:03.897 --> 00:23:05.336
Even if one imitates perfectly,

00:23:05.856 --> 00:23:07.657
one will still slip up, right?

00:23:14.457 --> 00:23:16.217
If you put down the pencil,

00:23:16.376 --> 00:23:17.737
we can talk properly.

00:23:50.257 --> 00:23:51.497
Forgot to ask.

00:23:53.336 --> 00:23:54.697
You kill human and drink blood.

00:23:56.697 --> 00:23:58.177
Is the meat in these noodles

00:23:59.457 --> 00:24:00.977
human flesh?

00:24:40.816 --> 00:24:42.457
Are you sure this is
the right direction?

00:24:43.657 --> 00:24:44.856
It shouldn't be much farther.

00:24:48.776 --> 00:24:49.977
You two take another taxi.

00:24:50.737 --> 00:24:51.536
I'm off work.

00:24:52.457 --> 00:24:55.336
There's a birdwatching platform ahead.

00:24:55.856 --> 00:24:56.616
Quite noticeable.

00:24:57.296 --> 00:24:58.737
Drive a bit further forward, please.

00:25:00.257 --> 00:25:02.536
What can you even see
in this pitch darkness?

00:25:04.017 --> 00:25:04.616
Listen.

00:25:05.497 --> 00:25:06.856
Can you hear the bird chirping?

00:25:08.096 --> 00:25:09.497
This is the bird we're looking for.

00:25:09.856 --> 00:25:10.536
What?

00:25:11.616 --> 00:25:12.616
Can't you even hear that?

00:25:13.497 --> 00:25:15.056
It's been chirping nonstop.

00:25:15.657 --> 00:25:16.977
The fiend.

00:27:11.576 --> 00:27:13.217
This batch of Yuwang Meat

00:27:13.336 --> 00:27:14.376
is really nice.

00:27:14.376 --> 00:27:16.056
Even though Conversion Shed
No. 4 is gone,

00:27:16.056 --> 00:27:17.417
as long as we have Yuwang Meat,

00:27:17.417 --> 00:27:18.657
we still have chances.

00:27:18.897 --> 00:27:19.856
Today's batch

00:27:20.096 --> 00:27:22.296
is enough for one buddy's root removal.

00:27:24.536 --> 00:27:25.217
Hurry!

00:27:25.217 --> 00:27:26.096
Here!

00:27:26.497 --> 00:27:28.417
Help her onto that bench. Hurry!

00:27:30.257 --> 00:27:31.056
Easy, easy.

00:27:31.296 --> 00:27:32.336
Check on her.

00:27:32.336 --> 00:27:34.257
I can't find what I need.
You go get the gauze.

00:27:34.336 --> 00:27:35.937
- Where's it?
- The room to change dressing.

00:27:35.937 --> 00:27:37.257
You've been there a lot. Hurry!

00:27:37.816 --> 00:27:39.056
Apply pressure.

00:27:39.056 --> 00:27:40.096
Easy, easy.

00:27:40.376 --> 00:27:41.217
Why did she faint?

00:27:41.217 --> 00:27:42.096
Anemia, right?

00:27:42.096 --> 00:27:43.017
A little.

00:27:43.737 --> 00:27:45.336
Did you get it? What took you so long?

00:27:45.737 --> 00:27:46.776
Go help him.

00:27:47.457 --> 00:27:47.977
I...

00:27:48.457 --> 00:27:49.296
Or you hold this.

00:27:49.296 --> 00:27:50.697
Hurry up, okay?

00:27:51.776 --> 00:27:54.096
Hurry up. It might be a severe wound.

00:27:54.096 --> 00:27:55.536
Her fingers might get stiff.

00:28:10.816 --> 00:28:11.657
Found it?

00:28:24.096 --> 00:28:24.937
Wake up.

00:28:25.536 --> 00:28:26.257
Stop pretending.

00:28:29.017 --> 00:28:30.096
You'll be free soon.

00:28:33.497 --> 00:28:34.576
Who exactly are you?

00:28:36.897 --> 00:28:37.977
Not a bad guy, anyway.

00:28:54.737 --> 00:28:56.296
It's fine. She's a friend of Tuo.

00:28:56.977 --> 00:28:57.737
Are you okay?

00:28:58.417 --> 00:28:58.897
She's okay.

00:28:58.897 --> 00:29:00.217
I taught her this little trick.

00:29:00.336 --> 00:29:01.257
Just looks bloody.

00:29:01.977 --> 00:29:03.336
But she's got real grit.

00:29:03.737 --> 00:29:04.937
She was merciless on herself.

00:29:06.657 --> 00:29:07.457
We should go.

00:29:08.937 --> 00:29:10.536
Follow her to a safe place.

00:29:11.336 --> 00:29:12.017
Use my car.

00:29:15.017 --> 00:29:16.737
I checked it. It won't be tracked.

00:29:18.816 --> 00:29:19.417
Thanks.

00:29:20.296 --> 00:29:21.697
What about you?

00:29:21.776 --> 00:29:23.177
Ms. Lin will suspect you.

00:29:27.776 --> 00:29:29.737
Miss Nie has to do me a small favor.

00:29:30.536 --> 00:29:31.417
What would you do?

00:29:32.737 --> 00:29:34.616
To leave him minor injuries like you.

00:29:35.697 --> 00:29:37.056
Don't worry. I can handle it.

00:29:40.576 --> 00:29:41.217
Let's go.

00:30:19.056 --> 00:30:20.897
Don't worry. No one is following us.

00:30:21.017 --> 00:30:21.776
I'm keeping watch.

00:30:25.177 --> 00:30:27.697
Lv Xian said you're Tuo's friend.

00:30:29.576 --> 00:30:30.856
A very trustworthy friend.

00:30:32.296 --> 00:30:33.616
Girlfriend?

00:30:38.816 --> 00:30:39.937
He told you so?

00:30:41.937 --> 00:30:44.697
No. Just guessing.

00:30:45.457 --> 00:30:47.336
Tuo doesn't trust people easily.

00:30:47.576 --> 00:30:49.096
He entrusted me to you.

00:30:50.897 --> 00:30:52.576
I bet your relationship must be special.

00:30:55.457 --> 00:30:56.536
You told Lv Xian

00:30:57.296 --> 00:30:59.657
Tuo is confined at home now, right?

00:31:02.257 --> 00:31:03.497
From what I remember,

00:31:04.697 --> 00:31:07.177
Ms. Lin never confined him like this.

00:31:09.536 --> 00:31:11.816
So she must've discovered something.

00:31:14.257 --> 00:31:14.897
Don't worry.

00:31:16.177 --> 00:31:17.376
After settling you in,

00:31:17.657 --> 00:31:19.136
I'll find a way to rescue him.

00:31:31.096 --> 00:31:32.177
Be careful, Shen.

00:31:32.296 --> 00:31:33.177
Don't get bitten.

00:31:33.336 --> 00:31:34.776
Though she won't risk omnivory.

00:31:35.336 --> 00:31:36.177
Focus on driving.

00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:48.921
(Xing Shen)

00:31:49.376 --> 00:31:50.576
Someone is here. Be brief.

00:31:51.336 --> 00:31:52.737
All four rats are in the cage.

00:31:53.856 --> 00:31:54.657
Is the cat unharmed?

00:31:55.497 --> 00:31:56.296
Perfectly unharmed.

00:31:57.616 --> 00:31:59.257
Good. Talk later.

00:32:22.060 --> 00:32:23.056
(Wanbao Tower)

00:32:52.536 --> 00:32:53.136
Sis.

00:32:53.336 --> 00:32:55.536
Ms. Lin, Lin Ling has been taken away.

00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:06.768
(Changxi Dumplings)

00:33:15.017 --> 00:33:16.816
Who is it at this hour?

00:33:24.136 --> 00:33:24.977
Miss Nie.

00:33:25.136 --> 00:33:25.937
Mr. Changxi.

00:33:26.816 --> 00:33:28.376
Sorry to bother you at this hour.

00:33:29.136 --> 00:33:30.417
This is Yan Tuo's sister,

00:33:30.417 --> 00:33:31.136
Lin Ling.

00:33:32.336 --> 00:33:33.217
Hello, Mr. Changxi.

00:33:33.737 --> 00:33:34.457
Hello.

00:33:35.977 --> 00:33:38.056
Tuo mentioned you before. You...

00:33:39.417 --> 00:33:41.017
Come in first.

00:33:46.457 --> 00:33:46.937
Have a seat.

00:33:51.897 --> 00:33:52.616
Well...

00:33:53.697 --> 00:33:54.457
Mr. Changxi,

00:33:54.816 --> 00:33:56.296
we've run into some trouble.

00:33:56.417 --> 00:33:57.457
Lin Ling might need

00:33:57.457 --> 00:33:58.856
to stay here for a while.

00:34:01.017 --> 00:34:02.776
Seems my place isn't a dumpling shop,

00:34:03.177 --> 00:34:05.217
but a Changxi Sanatorium.

00:34:06.536 --> 00:34:09.136
Every girl connected to Tuo

00:34:09.817 --> 00:34:11.417
gets sent here when injured.

00:34:12.616 --> 00:34:14.017
Where's Tuo?

00:34:18.056 --> 00:34:18.777
Yan Tuo...

00:34:20.576 --> 00:34:21.337
Tuo...

00:34:23.337 --> 00:34:23.977
He...

00:34:28.417 --> 00:34:30.377
Wait, what's wrong with him?

00:34:31.216 --> 00:34:32.176
What happened to Tuo?

00:34:33.056 --> 00:34:34.656
Nothing, Mr. Changxi. Don't worry.

00:34:35.497 --> 00:34:37.096
Yan Tuo has been busy.

00:34:37.417 --> 00:34:39.297
But I don't know exactly
what he's doing.

00:34:39.977 --> 00:34:41.256
When he returns,

00:34:41.656 --> 00:34:42.817
he'll explain it to you.

00:34:44.457 --> 00:34:46.616
I see. You can't tell me.

00:34:46.937 --> 00:34:47.897
And I won't ask further.

00:34:48.096 --> 00:34:48.616
Alright then.

00:34:48.817 --> 00:34:49.736
Just one thing.

00:34:50.297 --> 00:34:52.176
Don't do anything illegal.

00:34:52.696 --> 00:34:53.576
Don't worry.

00:34:54.216 --> 00:34:56.337
Don't you trust Yan Tuo?

00:34:58.136 --> 00:35:00.056
Alright, sit here for a bit.

00:35:00.337 --> 00:35:01.576
I'll go tidy up a room.

00:35:02.656 --> 00:35:03.216
Need help?

00:35:03.216 --> 00:35:03.817
No need.

00:35:04.377 --> 00:35:05.136
Thank you.

00:35:05.136 --> 00:35:05.736
Okay.

00:35:12.777 --> 00:35:14.056
Don't overthink it for now.

00:35:14.817 --> 00:35:15.656
Get some good rest.

00:35:19.736 --> 00:35:21.337
I've always wanted to escape that place.

Now that I'm out,

00:35:27.817 --> 00:35:29.457
and I don't know what to do.

00:35:35.337 --> 00:35:36.457
Starting today,

00:35:36.937 --> 00:35:38.096
you'll have plenty of time

Trust me, you'll love it.

00:35:51.616 --> 00:35:52.576
It's so late now.

00:35:53.777 --> 00:35:54.497
Wait a bit longer.

00:35:54.696 --> 00:35:55.417
It'll be soon.

00:36:02.576 --> 00:36:03.297
They're here.

might do it on purpose.
