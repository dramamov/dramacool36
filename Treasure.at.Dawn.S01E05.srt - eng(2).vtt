Why is there another person who uses incense ashes?

00:18:38.620 --> 00:18:39.780
The incense ashes can cure all diseases.

00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:41.140
It's nonsense.

00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:42.570

He wasn't seriously injured.

It's just some bruises.

00:19:47.550 --> 00:19:49.520
Don't expose his wound to water.

00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:50.550
And change his gauze every once in a while.

00:19:50.550 --> 00:19:51.070
Right.

00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:52.710

You took care of the poisoned water outside the city.

Yeah, it's me.

00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:15.280
The people who come to Xichuan

00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:17.590
have their own purposes.

00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:19.880
Some of them want money.

00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:21.800
Some of them want a bright future.

00:20:22.190 --> 00:20:23.640
They could have left, but they didn't.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.520
That's their choice.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.470
You don't have to pity them.

Otherwise,

00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:35.310
you'll get in trouble.

Whether you value what I say or not

00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:44.070

Did you drop that purse?

Your conscience caught up with you.

Could you give it to me yourself?

00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:43.120
A thief never leaves empty-handed.

If I give it back to you, I'll break the rules.

If you mix it with incense ashes,

Have a taste.

00:27:52.670 --> 00:27:53.470
Isn't it delicious?

00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:54.900
Delicious.

00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:55.660
Is it sour?

00:28:00.410 --> 00:28:00.970
Wait.

00:28:00.970 --> 00:28:01.770
It's mine.

00:28:01.770 --> 00:28:02.160
I...

00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:03.370
Tell me.

00:28:03.890 --> 00:28:04.850
Where did you steal it?

00:28:05.070 --> 00:28:06.460
We bought it.

00:28:06.940 --> 00:28:08.620
My brother had no appetite recently.

00:28:08.790 --> 00:28:10.310
I bought this to wake up his appetite.

00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:10.860
Wake up my appetite.

00:28:10.860 --> 00:28:11.660
Wake up your appetite?

00:28:16.830 --> 00:28:17.630
Wait.

00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:25.180
You're a horse slave.

00:28:25.180 --> 00:28:26.670
Do you deserve this?

00:28:26.670 --> 00:28:27.350
Get out of here.

00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:28.700
It hurts.

00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:29.590
Sir.

00:28:29.590 --> 00:28:31.170
Please spare my brother.

00:28:31.270 --> 00:28:33.110
We won't get in your way.

00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:34.630
Don't you understand me?

00:28:34.870 --> 00:28:35.550
Get away.

00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:41.070
Is your hand okay?

00:28:41.070 --> 00:28:41.630
It hurts.

00:28:41.630 --> 00:28:42.400
It hurts.

00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:45.200
Nonsense. You pushed me away.

00:28:45.330 --> 00:28:46.130
I...

00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:49.090
No.

00:28:49.330 --> 00:28:50.890
Let him go.

00:28:52.310 --> 00:28:53.010
Get away.

00:28:53.190 --> 00:28:54.160
Brother.

00:28:54.650 --> 00:28:55.330
Lunatic.

00:28:55.330 --> 00:28:56.760
You don't know who you are

00:28:56.760 --> 00:28:58.740
if I don't teach you a lesson.

00:28:58.950 --> 00:28:59.740
Brother.

00:29:02.580 --> 00:29:03.540
Sir, please spare me.

00:29:03.650 --> 00:29:05.450
I have money.

00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:07.890
I'll give you money.

00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:11.780
Brother.

00:29:12.450 --> 00:29:13.040
Brother.

00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:14.070
Don't come over, brother.

00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:15.610
Turn around.

00:29:28.660 --> 00:29:30.000
You...

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:31.580
You can step on my back.

00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:34.890
But you can't step on my brother's hand.

00:29:36.490 --> 00:29:37.760
You...

00:29:50.990 --> 00:29:51.470
Fu Sheng.

00:29:52.190 --> 00:29:53.270
Do you remember what you promised me

00:29:53.270 --> 00:29:54.340
in Shangyi?

00:29:56.030 --> 00:29:56.920
Of course.

00:29:57.230 --> 00:29:58.030
Good.

00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:00.230
When are you going to treat my dad?

00:30:00.230 --> 00:30:01.980
Can you give me a few more days?

00:30:02.370 --> 00:30:03.950
I want to visit Song Jingye first.

00:30:04.030 --> 00:30:04.920
Song Jingye?

00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:06.310
Why do you want to visit him?

00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:08.330
I need the Cloud-shaped Jade, the Water-shaped Jade,

00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:11.160
and the Mountain-shaped Jade

00:30:11.310 --> 00:30:12.230
for the Bird Jade Plate

00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:13.640
to unlock the Sealed Book.

00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:14.880
The Cloud-shaped Jade

00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:16.600
is right in Song Jingye's hand.

00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:18.600
My dad said in his will

00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:22.550
that Song Jingye could tell me the truth about the day.

00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:24.600
Can I have a look?

00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:26.230
Okay.

00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:27.750
Gu Tian, do you want to have a look?

00:30:29.750 --> 00:30:30.920
I'll have a look.

00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:31.750
You look at it first.

00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:42.160
Let me see.

00:30:43.310 --> 00:30:44.120
Fu Sheng.

00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:45.230
Since so many people

00:30:45.230 --> 00:30:46.640
want to get the Bird Jade Plate,

00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:47.510
we should keep it a secret

00:30:47.510 --> 00:30:48.680
to protect you.

00:30:49.030 --> 00:30:49.840
Don't worry.

00:30:49.990 --> 00:30:51.270
I won't even tell my dad.

00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:52.920
I understand.

00:30:52.990 --> 00:30:53.790
Fu Sheng.

00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:55.270
Don't

00:30:55.270 --> 00:30:56.600
leave me out of this.

00:30:57.500 --> 00:30:59.610
It's too dangerous.

00:30:59.610 --> 00:31:00.610
You'd better not get involved.

00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:04.420
I came with you all the way from Shangyi to Xichuan.

00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:06.700
Isn't it too late for you

00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:08.010
to tell me not to get involved?

00:31:09.140 --> 00:31:09.940
Besides,

00:31:10.180 --> 00:31:11.460
it's precisely because it's dangerous

00:31:11.740 --> 00:31:13.050
that you need me even more.

00:31:13.220 --> 00:31:14.250
I can protect you.

00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:15.460
Thank you. But it's fine.

00:31:15.610 --> 00:31:17.180
I can protect myself.

00:31:21.570 --> 00:31:22.290
Princess.

00:31:23.290 --> 00:31:24.610
Listen to this.

00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:26.010
From Shangyi to Xichuan,

00:31:26.530 --> 00:31:28.010
I protected him.

00:31:28.460 --> 00:31:29.940
You didn't dare to go to the toilet at night.

00:31:30.290 --> 00:31:31.330
Who risked his life

00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:32.770
to go with you?

00:31:34.610 --> 00:31:35.460
We finally got news

00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:37.290
of the Treasure of the Sealed Book.

00:31:37.810 --> 00:31:39.140
But you want to get rid of me.

00:31:42.850 --> 00:31:45.330
I swore in front of his dad's grave

00:31:45.770 --> 00:31:46.940
to protect him.

00:31:48.050 --> 00:31:49.010
Hurt.

00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:53.810
Fu Sheng, you're out of line.

00:31:58.220 --> 00:31:59.940
Come on. Drop the act.

00:31:59.940 --> 00:32:00.570
We'll go together.

00:32:00.940 --> 00:32:01.530
Okay.

Wait.

I'll go together with you.

00:32:11.330 --> 00:32:12.610
Don't mess around.

I'm not.

00:32:15.010 --> 00:32:17.490
If you want to be safe in Xichuan,

00:32:17.490 --> 00:32:18.510
you need me.

00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:19.570
Besides,

00:32:19.710 --> 00:32:21.250
you haven't treated my dad yet.

00:32:21.250 --> 00:32:22.220
I can't let anything happen to you.

00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:24.180
You...

00:32:26.290 --> 00:32:27.460
You got me.

00:32:27.530 --> 00:32:28.220
Okay.

00:32:28.220 --> 00:32:30.050
We'll go together.

00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:32.050
Okay.

That's a deal.

00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:35.010
I don't ask for much.

00:32:35.010 --> 00:32:36.330
When we get the Treasure of the Sealed Book,

00:32:36.330 --> 00:32:37.250
give me a share of the treasure.

00:32:37.420 --> 00:32:39.420
I want it enough for my two brothers to live a secure life.

It's late.

00:32:42.850 --> 00:32:44.050
I'll go home.

00:32:44.220 --> 00:32:45.050
We'll escort you home.

No, thanks.

Take care.

Okay, it's late.

Let's go to bed.

You go back...

00:33:00.850 --> 00:33:01.740
Are you going to sleep here?

00:33:02.850 --> 00:33:03.850
There is only one bed here.

00:33:03.850 --> 00:33:05.140
If I don't sleep here, where do I sleep?

00:33:05.810 --> 00:33:07.510

Tomorrow,

00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:16.320
My lord, if you...

00:35:18.790 --> 00:35:21.150
I'll do anything to make the Princess the Lord.

00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:22.400
Get up.

00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:26.230
Get up first.

00:35:34.030 --> 00:35:34.880
Jiu.

00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:37.640
I've always thought of you as my son.

00:35:38.470 --> 00:35:40.840
You and Jue grew up together.

00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:41.950
You're like brother and sister.

00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:46.440
I didn't marry her to you.

00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:47.990
That's not because I don't trust you.

00:35:49.030 --> 00:35:50.080
It's just...

00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:52.470
If I die,

00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:54.470
Jue and you

00:35:55.270 --> 00:35:56.640
cannot

00:35:57.080 --> 00:35:58.270
guard Xichuan.

00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:03.950
But why did you marry her to Ma Gang?

00:36:06.990 --> 00:36:07.950
You don't know.

00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:10.160
I used to be a bandit.

00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:12.920
I fought on horseback

00:36:13.510 --> 00:36:15.190
with my fighting skills.

00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:16.640
I fought my way here.

00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:19.030
I relied on the Star Gold to settle here.

00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:21.640
Gradually, Xichuan City is founded.

00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:24.030
Most of the people

00:36:24.470 --> 00:36:25.710
in the Chamber of Commerce are businessmen.

00:36:25.750 --> 00:36:26.950
They're calculating.

00:36:26.950 --> 00:36:28.160
They're not reliable.

00:36:28.550 --> 00:36:29.790
But Ma Gang is different.

00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:31.710
They are rough guys.

00:36:31.990 --> 00:36:33.550
But they are blunt

00:36:33.550 --> 00:36:34.790
and strong.

00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:36.680
Only these people

00:36:36.750 --> 00:36:38.160
can protect Jue.

00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:42.230
You worked so hard

00:36:42.790 --> 00:36:44.360
for the Princess.

00:36:47.790 --> 00:36:48.790
When you get married

00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:50.640
and have children

00:36:50.780 --> 00:36:51.620
in the future,

00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:54.680
you'll understand me.

00:37:15.890 --> 00:37:16.750
You guys,

00:37:16.870 --> 00:37:17.650
kill someone for me?

00:37:22.030 --> 00:37:24.050
You killed Song Jingye, the Chairman of Jibei Chamber of Commerce.

00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:25.280
We have all the evidence.

00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:25.980
Take them immediately!

00:37:26.190 --> 00:37:26.570
Wait.

00:37:26.590 --> 00:37:27.130
What?

00:37:27.590 --> 00:37:28.050
I...

00:37:32.260 --> 00:37:34.760
[The animals in the show are props]

00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:37.060
