00:08:45.821 --> 00:08:46.740
if anyone...

00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:49.140
I've only read about this in textbooks

00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:51.260
- and never seen real cases.
- ...damages our company's reputation,

00:08:51.496 --> 00:08:52.140
we will

00:08:52.461 --> 00:08:53.941
take legal action.

00:08:54.221 --> 00:08:57.260
We'll pursue all legal liabilities.

00:08:57.660 --> 00:08:59.301
Everyone involved in this disturbance

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:01.421
will face compensation demands

00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:03.500
and potential imprisonment.

00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:05.821
- What?
- Well...

00:09:08.341 --> 00:09:09.101
Let me see that.

00:09:09.981 --> 00:09:11.821
They owe us money!

00:09:18.461 --> 00:09:19.660
Show me that legal statement.

00:09:19.944 --> 00:09:20.552
Fine.

00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:21.581
I'll show you.

00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:23.941
Let this young lady examine it

00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:25.020
and educate you.

00:09:26.341 --> 00:09:26.981
Read it aloud.

00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:31.260
In this case,

00:09:31.341 --> 00:09:32.981
as the apartment lessee,

00:09:33.061 --> 00:09:34.701
I'll draft a formal response.

00:09:39.701 --> 00:09:40.740
Will this work?

00:09:47.301 --> 00:09:48.101
What is this?

00:09:48.181 --> 00:09:48.740
I don't know.

00:09:53.646 --> 00:09:54.472
(Reply letter)

00:09:56.181 --> 00:09:58.061
Your party has
committed breach of contract.

00:09:58.540 --> 00:09:59.860
This formal notice demands

00:10:00.181 --> 00:10:02.461
immediate rectification of violations.

00:10:02.821 --> 00:10:04.061
Failure to comply will

00:10:04.061 --> 00:10:05.581
result in all available legal measures

00:10:05.581 --> 00:10:07.140
to hold you accountable.

00:10:07.301 --> 00:10:08.020
That's it.

00:10:08.461 --> 00:10:09.221
- Well done!
- Well done!

00:10:09.421 --> 00:10:09.928
Excellent.

00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:11.020
She knows the law!

00:10:12.301 --> 00:10:14.221
Impressive. We've got an expert here

00:10:14.221 --> 00:10:15.701
with commanding presence!

00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:17.061
Let me remind you.

00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:18.500
If you haven't forgotten

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:19.981
what you learned at Law School,

00:10:20.101 --> 00:10:23.221
handwritten letters hold legal validity.

00:10:24.181 --> 00:10:26.701
- Well done!
- Well done!

00:10:28.301 --> 00:10:29.620
Wait, young lady!

00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:31.620
Which law school did you graduate from?

00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:32.660
Playing lawyer here?

00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:36.140
Law School at Jingbei University.
I work at Jun An Law Firm.

00:10:36.421 --> 00:10:37.101
It's Jun An.

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:38.061
Any more questions?

00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:39.620
Jun An?

00:10:40.221 --> 00:10:41.421
Let's go in.

00:10:42.421 --> 00:10:43.061
Wait.

00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:44.380
Everyone, listen!

00:10:46.341 --> 00:10:47.301
Is Jun An famous?

00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:50.581
Jun An is one of the top law firms.

00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:52.620
I also work there.

00:10:53.421 --> 00:10:54.941
She also works there.

00:10:55.061 --> 00:10:56.701
- So we have hope to defend our rights.
- She's

00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:58.061
Ren Jiatong.

00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:00.221
Ren Jiatong.

00:11:00.221 --> 00:11:01.500
Ren Jiatong.

00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:05.900
Hello.

00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:07.140
Could you help me check

00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:08.540
my landlord's contact information?

00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:10.140
I live in Wanjia Garden.

00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:11.860
Building 13, Unit 2, Apartment 602.

00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:14.061
Okay, I'll help you check.

00:11:16.981 --> 00:11:17.640
Found it.

00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:18.301
Thanks.

00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:26.461
Yes.

00:11:27.821 --> 00:11:28.780
I'll take a call.

00:11:29.181 --> 00:11:30.020
Go ahead.

00:11:30.312 --> 00:11:30.941
Hello?

00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:32.821
Who's this?

00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:36.424
Hello?

00:11:37.461 --> 00:11:38.221
Hello, madam.

00:11:39.981 --> 00:11:41.301
I'm the tenant of your house.

00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:45.000
You changed the locks
without telling me.

00:11:45.221 --> 00:11:46.301
But even as the owner,

00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:48.341
without the tenant's consent,

00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:49.821
you forcibly entered the house,

00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:51.701
which is suspected of illegal intrusion.

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:55.941
It violates the Law on Security
Administration Punishments or Criminal Law.

00:11:55.941 --> 00:11:57.020
Once I call the police,

00:11:57.140 --> 00:11:58.301
at least, you'll get fined.

00:11:58.301 --> 00:12:00.461
At worse, you might even
be detained or imprisoned.

00:12:01.221 --> 00:12:02.461
Please give me the key.

00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:03.780
According to the law,

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:05.981
a landlord has no right
to evict tenants.

00:12:06.181 --> 00:12:08.500
Tenants have the right, under the lease,

00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:09.260
to continue living.

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:18.500
Hold on.

00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:29.960
(Law School at Haryald University)

00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:31.540
Hello, Miss Ren.

00:12:32.221 --> 00:12:32.860
I'm Jiang Chen.

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:34.101
This is my aunt.

00:12:41.581 --> 00:12:42.981
It's the contract between my aunt

00:12:42.981 --> 00:12:43.821
and Warm Nest.

00:12:44.061 --> 00:12:45.860
It's essentially a sublease agreement.

00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:47.461
That is to say,

00:12:47.461 --> 00:12:48.740
my aunt leased her property

00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:49.900
to Warm Nest Apartments

00:12:50.101 --> 00:12:51.981
which then subleased it to you.

00:12:52.701 --> 00:12:54.821
Neither of you has
a direct contract relationship,

00:12:55.181 --> 00:12:56.140
so you have no right

00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:56.900
to demand my aunt

00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:58.500
to ensure your continued tenancy.

00:12:59.341 --> 00:13:00.181
Since you acknowledge

00:13:00.181 --> 00:13:02.301
there's no contract
between me and the landlord,

00:13:02.301 --> 00:13:03.981
then based on
the relativity of contracts,

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:05.540
the landlord also has no right

00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:07.380
to evict me based on Warm Nest's failure

00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:08.941
to pay the rent.

00:13:09.101 --> 00:13:10.461
But you need to note

00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:12.101
that my aunt is now

00:13:12.101 --> 00:13:14.260
not basing her request to vacate
on the contract,

00:13:14.581 --> 00:13:16.380
but on her rights as a property owner

00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:17.341
to ask you to leave.

00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:20.061
If your legal knowledge

00:13:20.061 --> 00:13:21.101
hasn't been forgotten,

00:13:21.101 --> 00:13:22.020
you should remember

00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:24.301
that property ownership rights
are absolute.

00:13:26.852 --> 00:13:28.421
(Are property rights absolute? Yes.)

00:13:28.421 --> 00:13:29.581
At least as of today,

00:13:29.581 --> 00:13:31.821
your aunt hasn't terminated the contract

00:13:31.821 --> 00:13:33.061
with Warm Nest.

00:13:33.341 --> 00:13:35.181
So my lease with Warm Nest Apartments

00:13:35.181 --> 00:13:35.900
is still valid.

00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:38.341
I still have the right
to legally occupy this rental.

00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:39.581
I understand.

00:13:39.941 --> 00:13:40.461
- But...
- Chen,

00:13:41.221 --> 00:13:42.260
call your dad.

00:13:42.581 --> 00:13:43.941
His Ruocheng Law Firm

00:13:43.941 --> 00:13:45.461
is not any worse than Jun An.

00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:46.421
If it doesn't work,

00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:47.701
we'll go to court.

00:13:48.221 --> 00:13:49.380
We also have lawyers.

00:13:56.860 --> 00:13:59.020
I don't recommend
going the litigation route.

00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:02.341
The time and financial costs
are very high.

00:14:03.061 --> 00:14:04.821
Actually, you two can negotiate.

00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:07.581
I don't know if you're willing.

00:14:08.101 --> 00:14:09.821
You pay another month's rent.

00:14:10.341 --> 00:14:11.821
You let her stay for another month.

00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:13.461
You can both keep an eye on

00:14:13.461 --> 00:14:14.421
how things develop.

00:14:17.341 --> 00:14:17.981
Alright.

00:14:19.101 --> 00:14:20.341
I'll listen to you.

00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:24.061
This whole night has been exhausting.

00:14:28.981 --> 00:14:29.581
What about you?

00:14:30.701 --> 00:14:32.461
Do you accept my proposal?

00:14:35.336 --> 00:14:36.072
Deal.

00:14:42.181 --> 00:14:42.728
Miss Ren.

00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:45.140
You work at Jun An, right?

00:14:46.941 --> 00:14:47.701
We'll meet again.

00:15:12.581 --> 00:15:13.941
What's going on with you?

00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:15.860
Why didn't you answer my calls?

00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:19.941
I just want to ask when is your payday.

00:15:20.221 --> 00:15:22.380
Don't let creditors come knocking again.

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:23.821
Don't make Mr. Lin unhappy.

00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:25.581
I'm not scolding you.

00:15:25.581 --> 00:15:27.061
You had a stable job before,

00:15:27.061 --> 00:15:28.221
but you insisted on quitting.

00:15:28.581 --> 00:15:30.581
Who knows if you'll stay this time.

00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:33.260
This is your dad's fault.

00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:35.660
Just pay back the money
as soon as possible.

00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:37.620
Only then can we live properly.

Yan Da, will you ever stop?

00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:09.221
I got three calls already this morning

from Lawyer Xu who worked with Xingke,

and a receptionist waiting downstairs.

When did you meet many Jun An people?

eases my mind.

You are my little sister.

If anyone bullies you, it should be me.

00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:25.901
No outsiders can do that.

00:19:36.661 --> 00:19:37.621
What's wrong with you?

00:19:38.701 --> 00:19:39.780
Watch the road!

00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:40.661
Didn't see my signal?

00:19:40.701 --> 00:19:41.580
I had right of way.

00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:42.780
Even so, watch the road.

00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:43.780
Why didn't you yield?

00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:44.780
Call the cops.

00:19:44.901 --> 00:19:45.621
No more talking.

00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:46.701
You're not leaving.

00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:47.381
Sure.

00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:49.941
You're in a hurry?

00:19:49.941 --> 00:19:50.500
You can't go.

00:19:58.020 --> 00:19:58.820
Are you hurt?

00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:00.901
Are you alright?

00:20:02.181 --> 00:20:04.020
Help your wife into
my car. I'll take you.

00:20:04.861 --> 00:20:06.300
We were carpooling. Not my wife.

00:20:06.861 --> 00:20:07.981
I'm on my way to work.

00:20:08.381 --> 00:20:09.100
It really hurts.

00:20:10.381 --> 00:20:11.381
Hand me your phone.

00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:14.260
Don't be scared.

00:20:14.621 --> 00:20:15.340
Follow me.

00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:16.260
Thanks.

00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:18.621
Lend a hand here!

00:20:18.621 --> 00:20:20.981
She's not your wife,
but couldn't you be a helper?

00:20:21.421 --> 00:20:23.060
No one's stopping you doing good deeds,

00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:24.861
but I'm an unrelated single man.

00:20:24.861 --> 00:20:25.500
Helping her?

00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:27.381
If something happens,
how could I explain?

00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:28.580
Relax.

00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:29.500
I study law.

00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:30.740
I'll handle the explanations.

00:20:31.661 --> 00:20:32.260
Actually,

00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:33.701
I happen to study law too.

00:20:36.941 --> 00:20:38.221
Unbelievable.

00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:39.780
Don't panic.

00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:41.181
Get out of the car.

00:20:42.632 --> 00:20:43.181
Let's go.

00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:48.540
We'll be there soon.

00:20:49.381 --> 00:20:50.260
Easy now.

00:21:06.701 --> 00:21:07.221
Good morning.

00:21:07.421 --> 00:21:08.100
I'm Zhou Nian,

00:21:08.421 --> 00:21:09.500
a fourth-year lawyer here.

00:21:09.943 --> 00:21:10.760
(Zhou Nian, 30, M&A Group 2)

00:21:11.381 --> 00:21:12.780
I'm responsible

00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:13.780
for group assignments.

00:21:14.181 --> 00:21:15.300
Consider me your mentor.

00:21:15.701 --> 00:21:17.421
Feel free to approach me anytime.

00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:18.540
Follow me, please.

00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:21.941
Jun An Law Firm,

00:21:21.981 --> 00:21:23.540
established in the early 1990s,

00:21:23.661 --> 00:21:25.621
is one of top Red Circle Firms.

00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:26.661
The program is

00:21:26.661 --> 00:21:28.060
a big competition

00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:29.661
organized by Director Zhuang Xin.

00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:31.060
It's also

00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:32.861
the eighth program
in our 30-year history.

00:21:32.981 --> 00:21:34.621
You all managed to stand out

00:21:34.621 --> 00:21:35.500
and join the program.

00:21:36.941 --> 00:21:37.780
This is your chance.

00:21:45.861 --> 00:21:47.740
The entire program lasts three months.

00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:48.901
(Mission)
It's divided into seven rounds.

00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:50.701
Each round has one or multiple missions.

00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:51.941
Points will accumulate.

00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:54.820
Each round, we'll eliminate
the lowest performers based on points.

00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:56.580
With total score
across all rounds tallied,

00:21:56.580 --> 00:21:59.181
final offers will be determined
by final rankings and scores.

00:21:59.400 --> 00:21:59.901
Besides,

00:21:59.901 --> 00:22:00.820
we'll be combining

00:22:00.901 --> 00:22:03.141
team system and lawyer pool,
a dual-track system.

00:22:03.381 --> 00:22:04.421
Beyond formal assignments,

00:22:04.701 --> 00:22:06.461
(Office, Bai Xiao)
you can earn points

00:22:06.621 --> 00:22:07.580
from the lawyer pool.

00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:10.461
These will be your workstations.

00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:13.141
For three months, you're all candidates.

00:22:13.381 --> 00:22:15.060
Only the ultimate winners

00:22:15.221 --> 00:22:17.181
will secure full-time internships

00:22:17.181 --> 00:22:17.981
along with bonus.

00:22:18.221 --> 00:22:19.461
You'll have a handsome salary

00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:20.540
and mentorship

00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:21.221
from partners.

00:22:22.141 --> 00:22:22.740
However,

00:22:23.621 --> 00:22:25.621
only one or two spots exist.

00:22:25.820 --> 00:22:26.440
Therefore,

00:22:26.540 --> 00:22:28.340
from the moment you entered Jun An,

00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:29.780
you became competitors.

00:22:31.981 --> 00:22:32.780
One final reminder,

00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:35.661
this isn't a learning environment.

00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:36.661
You must prove

00:22:36.981 --> 00:22:39.060
that you're exactly who Jun An needs.

00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:40.540
Best of the best.

00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:42.100
Starting today,

00:22:42.421 --> 00:22:44.181
your primary daily focus should be

00:22:44.701 --> 00:22:47.020
simple survival in this program.

00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:50.941
Are you all ready?

00:23:00.690 --> 00:23:01.384
(Talent Hunt Program)

00:23:01.384 --> 00:23:04.136
(Jun An Law Firm)

00:23:06.056 --> 00:23:07.576
(Red Circle Firms,)

00:23:07.576 --> 00:23:09.536
(known as a colloquial term,)

00:23:09.536 --> 00:23:10.836
(refer to the top law firms)

00:23:10.836 --> 00:23:13.128
(in China's legal service industry.)

00:23:16.744 --> 00:23:17.384
Hello.

00:23:17.701 --> 00:23:18.540
I have a question.

00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:22.141
What are the team system
and lawyer pool?

00:23:22.141 --> 00:23:23.020
I don't get it.

00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:26.981
The team system means

00:23:26.981 --> 00:23:28.540
if you survive the elimination rounds,

00:23:28.621 --> 00:23:29.540
lawyers will draft you.

00:23:29.832 --> 00:23:30.500
Then,

00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:32.060
you'll join their practice group,

00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:33.340
working directly under them.

00:23:33.941 --> 00:23:35.141
The lawyer pool means

00:23:35.141 --> 00:23:36.981
we're firm-wide interns.

00:23:36.981 --> 00:23:38.941
Any lawyer can put us

00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:40.461
to work.

00:23:42.221 --> 00:23:44.221
We'll be worked to death!

00:23:44.621 --> 00:23:46.901
Red Circle Firms are famous
for brutal hours

00:23:46.901 --> 00:23:48.260
and fat paychecks.

00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:50.221
They grind lawyers down.

00:23:50.661 --> 00:23:52.100
Take litigation lawyers.

00:23:52.461 --> 00:23:54.181
If they leave by 10:00 PM,

00:23:54.181 --> 00:23:55.661
it's considered early.

00:23:56.181 --> 00:23:57.060
Non-litigation lawyers

00:23:57.141 --> 00:23:58.820
are basically on standby.

00:23:59.861 --> 00:24:01.421
If you can't handle it, just leave.

00:24:03.701 --> 00:24:05.701
I'm a professional. I'm used to it.

00:24:08.701 --> 00:24:09.416
Thank you.

00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:13.288
Mr. Zhuang,

00:24:13.941 --> 00:24:15.740
the list of lawyers qualifying

00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:17.500
for limited equity partnership

00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:20.260
via three-year revenue benchmarks
is in your inbox.

00:24:20.381 --> 00:24:21.621
After committee consultation,

00:24:21.621 --> 00:24:23.740
preliminary review is set
for next month.

00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:24.901
I've cleared your schedule

00:24:24.901 --> 00:24:26.792
for that timeframe.

00:24:26.792 --> 00:24:27.336
Additionally,

00:24:27.336 --> 00:24:28.941
Warm Nest Apartments' legal director

00:24:28.941 --> 00:24:30.260
suddenly came this morning.

00:24:30.461 --> 00:24:31.941
He requests us

00:24:31.941 --> 00:24:33.500
as their new retained counsel

00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:35.100
to lead settlement negotiations.

00:24:35.141 --> 00:24:36.901
He requested Ms. Bai's involvement.

00:24:38.820 --> 00:24:40.461
Please welcome Director Zhuang Xin,

00:24:40.901 --> 00:24:41.941
our founding partner.

00:24:45.384 --> 00:24:45.960
Everyone.

00:24:46.381 --> 00:24:46.901
Good morning.

00:24:47.272 --> 00:24:47.820
Sit down.

00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:48.552
Sit.

00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:52.221
As a founding partner,

00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:53.861
Mr. Zhuang has championed

00:24:53.861 --> 00:24:55.941
this talent development initiative.

00:24:55.941 --> 00:24:57.064
(Zhuang Xin, 53,
Director of Jun An Law Firm)

00:24:57.181 --> 00:24:57.981
We'll now begin

00:24:58.381 --> 00:25:00.060
with one-minute self-introductions.

00:25:00.861 --> 00:25:01.500
Volunteers?

00:25:04.381 --> 00:25:05.000
I'll go.

00:25:05.512 --> 00:25:06.120
Go ahead.

00:25:09.621 --> 00:25:11.260
Hello, I'm Guo Xiaoyu.

00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:14.141
I have diverse hobbies.

00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:16.701
I love photography and Hanfu culture.

00:25:17.181 --> 00:25:19.100
I'm a weeb, in fact.

00:25:22.221 --> 00:25:24.500
I'm also a total milk tea addict.

00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:26.060
So whenever you want milk tea,

00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:27.340
just feel free

00:25:27.621 --> 00:25:29.100
to place group orders with me.

00:25:30.340 --> 00:25:31.820
At school, teachers

00:25:31.981 --> 00:25:32.820
and classmates

00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:34.260
love teaming up with me.

00:25:34.621 --> 00:25:37.820
My biggest strength is,

00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:40.340
I'm thick-skinned yet resilient.

00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:42.100
Most troubles fade away

00:25:42.260 --> 00:25:43.540
after I have a good cry.

00:25:43.861 --> 00:25:44.580
As long as I want,

00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:46.740
I can stay happy every single day.

00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:48.780
Thank you.

00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:49.820
Good.

00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:54.221
One question.

00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:58.901
What's a weeb?

00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:01.020
I don't know either.

00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:02.408
Well...

00:26:03.976 --> 00:26:04.616
Please.

00:26:06.461 --> 00:26:07.141
I'm Wang Lu.

00:26:07.580 --> 00:26:08.648
(Wang Lu, 25, Law School at Huaqing University)
I previously interned at Jun An.

00:26:08.648 --> 00:26:09.580
(Third-year combined bachelor's
and master's student)

00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:11.701
This program is so good.

00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:13.701
So I applied to transfer
from regular internship

00:26:13.701 --> 00:26:15.221
to the program candidate.

00:26:15.701 --> 00:26:17.181
My advantage over others

00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:18.701
is my prior experience here.

00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:20.941
After all, I've worked here for months,

00:26:21.221 --> 00:26:22.421
so feel free to ask me

00:26:22.621 --> 00:26:23.381
any questions.

00:26:33.861 --> 00:26:34.540
Hello, sir.

00:26:34.941 --> 00:26:35.740
I'm Li Ke.

00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:36.981
It's L I, Li,

00:26:37.141 --> 00:26:38.740
and K E, Ke.

00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:45.740
I consider myself

00:26:45.901 --> 00:26:47.780
experienced in practical work

00:26:47.941 --> 00:26:49.580
and academically competent.

00:26:50.020 --> 00:26:51.100
I interned

00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:53.181
at the Provincial High People's Court

00:26:53.461 --> 00:26:56.421
and got involved in
university-level research projects.

00:26:57.992 --> 00:26:58.580
Also,

00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:00.901
I am

00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:03.060
an alumnus of Lawyer Zhou Nian.

00:27:06.981 --> 00:27:08.300
Li Ke, don't get cocky.

00:27:09.861 --> 00:27:10.440
Sit.

00:27:18.020 --> 00:27:19.141
I've reviewed your resumes.

00:27:19.661 --> 00:27:20.621
You're not the best.

00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:22.861
One female candidate here

00:27:23.221 --> 00:27:24.981
interned at the Supreme Court
as undergrad

00:27:25.780 --> 00:27:27.181
and published solo-authored paper

00:27:27.181 --> 00:27:28.820
in core journal during grad school.

00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:32.540
Who's this superstar?

00:27:33.181 --> 00:27:33.736
Ren Jiatong.

00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:38.340
Holy moly!

00:27:39.661 --> 00:27:41.621
Very impressive.

00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:47.740
Mr. Zhuang.

00:27:48.540 --> 00:27:49.661
Pardon the interruption.

00:27:55.141 --> 00:27:56.260
Mr. Zhuang, I've confirmed

00:27:56.421 --> 00:27:58.500
that Ren Jiatong
impersonated our lawyer.

00:27:58.820 --> 00:28:00.780
She's a Talent Hunt Program candidate,

00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:01.901
not on official roster.

00:28:01.901 --> 00:28:03.020
That's why she was missed.

00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:04.461
Last night,

00:28:04.461 --> 00:28:06.221
someone posed as your lawyer.

00:28:06.340 --> 00:28:07.500
We verified it overnight.

00:28:07.861 --> 00:28:09.701
There's no such lawyer at Jun An

00:28:10.141 --> 00:28:12.141
Mr. Zhuang, we're sincere

00:28:12.381 --> 00:28:13.740
about switching to Jun An.

00:28:13.941 --> 00:28:14.901
But with this incident,

00:28:15.141 --> 00:28:16.060
you need to give us

00:28:16.421 --> 00:28:18.020
a proper explanation.

00:28:18.580 --> 00:28:20.260
How will we handle this?

00:28:20.981 --> 00:28:21.661
Okay, got it.

00:28:22.060 --> 00:28:22.661
You may leave.

00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:23.912
Okay.

00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:26.580
Proceed.

00:28:29.221 --> 00:28:31.060
Esteemed lawyers and candidates,

00:28:31.340 --> 00:28:33.941
I'm Jiang Chen, studying at
Law School of Haryald.

00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:37.300
I once interned at
Latham Simpson Law Firm in the US.

00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:38.820
He's truly impressive.

00:28:39.100 --> 00:28:40.820
Latham Simpson Law Firm

00:28:40.820 --> 00:28:42.780
is known as the nerd crusher

00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:44.500
and only accepts top six law grads.

00:28:44.901 --> 00:28:46.100
I hear Mr. Zhuang favors him.

00:28:46.381 --> 00:28:47.580
During interview, he said,

00:28:47.901 --> 00:28:48.901
"This is our guy."

00:28:49.340 --> 00:28:51.060
Through this program,

00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:51.981
I hope to find

00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:53.461
worthy rivals

00:28:54.181 --> 00:28:55.141
and true friends.

00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:03.461
Mr. Zhuang, pardon me.

00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:04.500
I'm late.

00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:08.020
Your brother called me this morning.

00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:10.060
He said you did a good deed

00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:11.300
on your way to work.

00:29:11.981 --> 00:29:12.552
Right?

00:29:12.740 --> 00:29:13.320
No big deal.

00:29:13.896 --> 00:29:14.461
Have a seat.

00:29:15.020 --> 00:29:15.621
Find a spot.

00:29:20.540 --> 00:29:21.340
So you are

00:29:21.820 --> 00:29:22.981
a lawyer from Jun An.

00:29:27.020 --> 00:29:29.740
Hello, I'm Ren Jiatong.
I graduated from Jingbei University.

00:29:49.221 --> 00:29:49.861
Mr. Zhou.

00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:51.141
Mr. Zhou.

00:29:51.141 --> 00:29:52.820
Could you tell me

00:29:52.820 --> 00:29:54.421
the ranking from this interview?

00:29:58.221 --> 00:29:59.100
Guo Xiaoyu.

00:30:00.701 --> 00:30:01.221
Last place.

00:30:05.820 --> 00:30:06.376
Mr. Zhuang.

00:30:07.100 --> 00:30:07.661
Jiang Chen.

00:30:08.181 --> 00:30:09.941
I'm thrilled to join the program.

00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:11.141
I wonder if you have time

00:30:11.141 --> 00:30:12.141
to have dinner with us?

00:30:13.381 --> 00:30:14.981
I've scheduled a dinner with a client.

00:30:15.540 --> 00:30:16.941
He's got some nerve.

00:30:17.381 --> 00:30:19.221
He dares to ask Mr. Zhuang out directly.

00:30:20.941 --> 00:30:21.576
How about this?

00:30:22.141 --> 00:30:23.060
Let me know

00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:24.381
if you're free tomorrow.

00:30:24.540 --> 00:30:25.580
I should be available

00:30:25.780 --> 00:30:26.701
all day tomorrow.

00:30:26.701 --> 00:30:27.740
I'm not sure yet

00:30:27.740 --> 00:30:28.901
about my exact schedule.

00:30:28.901 --> 00:30:30.500
Well, review your work plan.

00:30:30.740 --> 00:30:31.981
Call me when it's convenient.

00:30:32.421 --> 00:30:32.941
Thank you.

00:30:33.192 --> 00:30:33.704
Alright.

00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:39.340
His Ruocheng Law Firm

00:30:39.340 --> 00:30:40.901
is not any worse than Jun An.

00:30:41.060 --> 00:30:41.820
If it doesn't work,

00:30:41.941 --> 00:30:43.100
we'll go to court.

00:30:43.621 --> 00:30:44.820
We also have lawyers.

00:30:48.674 --> 00:30:49.414
(Jiang Ruocheng)

00:30:49.414 --> 00:30:50.364

(Ruocheng Law Firm)

00:30:52.141 --> 00:30:53.820
Lawyer Ren Jiatong

00:30:54.580 --> 00:30:55.240
at Jun An.

00:30:56.540 --> 00:30:58.461
Glad to see you. Just call me Jiang.

00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:11.020
I hope you'll
keep yesterday's matter confidential.

00:31:11.901 --> 00:31:14.100
I don't owe you confidentiality.

00:31:16.181 --> 00:31:17.260
If you agree to keep quiet,

00:31:17.661 --> 00:31:19.461
(Jiang Ruocheng)
I'll keep this a secret too.

00:31:22.901 --> 00:31:23.540
Impressive.

00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:26.181
I don't know where you found this,

00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:27.260
but I can be quiet,

00:31:27.621 --> 00:31:29.500
provided that this ends here.

00:31:31.688 --> 00:31:32.260
Deal.

00:31:34.340 --> 00:31:35.740
A Haryald elite should know

00:31:35.740 --> 00:31:37.661
oral agreements
hold legal weight, right?

00:31:40.020 --> 00:31:40.981
An agreement

00:31:41.461 --> 00:31:42.181
is an agreement.

00:31:44.776 --> 00:31:46.600
(Ren Jiatong)

00:31:50.540 --> 00:31:52.701
I've prepared small gifts for everyone.

00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:53.941
Hope you'll like them.

00:31:54.141 --> 00:31:54.981
Thank you.

00:31:57.181 --> 00:31:57.901
Guo Xiaoyu.

00:31:58.540 --> 00:31:59.176
Thanks.

00:32:00.461 --> 00:32:02.580
The decorations on your desk are cute.

00:32:04.901 --> 00:32:05.901
I doubt

00:32:06.141 --> 00:32:08.020
if they and I can

00:32:08.020 --> 00:32:08.941
survive this week.

00:32:11.740 --> 00:32:12.264
Go for it!

00:32:15.421 --> 00:32:16.040
Huang Yue.

00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:17.160
Thank you.

00:32:18.780 --> 00:32:19.461
Ren Jiatong.

00:32:19.901 --> 00:32:20.456
Thanks.

00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:24.808
Thank you.

00:32:27.016 --> 00:32:27.540
Thanks.

00:32:31.798 --> 00:32:33.960
(Xingke Group)

00:32:34.701 --> 00:32:35.580
Xingke Group?

00:32:37.901 --> 00:32:38.568
Wang Lu.

00:32:40.740 --> 00:32:41.288
Thank you.

00:32:45.340 --> 00:32:45.896
Yan Fei.

00:32:48.060 --> 00:32:49.020
Sorry about earlier.

00:32:49.540 --> 00:32:50.540
I had urgent business

00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:51.340
so I left.

00:32:51.820 --> 00:32:53.701
Is that pregnant woman okay?

00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:55.181
Don't worry.

00:32:55.221 --> 00:32:56.421
The pregnant woman is fine.

00:32:56.780 --> 00:32:58.060
But I learned from you

00:32:58.060 --> 00:33:00.260
what makes an excellent lawyer

00:33:00.580 --> 00:33:02.300
and how to mitigate risks.

00:33:08.540 --> 00:33:09.060
Yan Fei.

00:33:09.300 --> 00:33:10.421
I reject your accusation.

00:33:10.941 --> 00:33:13.060
First, I couldn't help objectively.

00:33:13.260 --> 00:33:14.632
Second, humans are unpredictable.

00:33:14.820 --> 00:33:16.701
If she blamed me for the injury

00:33:16.740 --> 00:33:17.661
and sued for damages,

00:33:17.661 --> 00:33:18.500
I'd defend myself.

00:33:18.901 --> 00:33:19.421
Finally,

00:33:19.580 --> 00:33:21.381
this morning was crucial for me.

00:33:21.621 --> 00:33:22.941
Had I taken her to hospital,

00:33:22.941 --> 00:33:24.740
it could've ruined my career.

00:33:25.181 --> 00:33:26.901
I might become the first one eliminated,

00:33:26.981 --> 00:33:27.861
losing this offer.

00:33:28.141 --> 00:33:28.740
I refuse.

00:33:38.020 --> 00:33:39.060
This your license plate?

00:33:44.500 --> 00:33:45.421
Your phone number?

00:33:47.260 --> 00:33:48.740
How did you get my number?

00:33:49.740 --> 00:33:50.901
You recited it yourself.

00:33:51.368 --> 00:33:51.976
Hello?

00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:54.060
I'm taking your wife to the hospital.

00:33:54.060 --> 00:33:55.300
Note down my phone number.

00:33:55.740 --> 00:33:58.901
13576275355.

00:34:00.141 --> 00:34:01.740
Four digits repeated in eleven numbers.

00:34:01.820 --> 00:34:02.941
Is it hard to memorize?

00:34:03.260 --> 00:34:05.300
I remember your license plate
and phone number.

00:34:05.421 --> 00:34:06.661
Once I finish my work,

00:34:06.740 --> 00:34:08.821
I'll contact you and the hospital

00:34:08.981 --> 00:34:10.620
to know the pregnant woman's condition.

00:34:10.861 --> 00:34:11.861
As lawyers,

00:34:11.861 --> 00:34:12.461
we must

00:34:12.461 --> 00:34:14.020
distinguish the priority of matters.

00:34:14.620 --> 00:34:15.700
I just want to say

00:34:15.941 --> 00:34:17.580
that besides avoiding risks,

00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:19.700
recording crucial information promptly

00:34:20.060 --> 00:34:21.861
and making sound decisions are also

00:34:21.861 --> 00:34:23.421
essential qualities of a good lawyer.

00:34:24.540 --> 00:34:26.261
Everyone, install the internal software.

00:34:26.381 --> 00:34:27.861
I've sent the link and password.

00:34:28.301 --> 00:34:29.261
Log in first.

00:34:29.301 --> 00:34:30.500
Get familiar with the system.

00:34:30.741 --> 00:34:31.660
Then go for lunch.

00:34:35.060 --> 00:34:36.261
It's our first day here.

00:34:36.261 --> 00:34:37.620
How about having lunch together?

00:34:38.381 --> 00:34:39.100
Mr. Zhou, join us.

00:34:39.301 --> 00:34:39.901
I'll pass.

00:34:40.261 --> 00:34:41.461
I'm busy. Enjoy your meal.

00:34:43.220 --> 00:34:43.981
Let's go.

00:34:44.461 --> 00:34:44.981
- Sure.
- Go.

00:34:45.736 --> 00:34:46.344
Come on.

00:34:54.580 --> 00:34:55.421
Aren't you eating?

00:34:55.540 --> 00:34:56.620
I'm not hungry.

00:34:57.261 --> 00:34:58.341
I want to study the system.

00:35:00.072 --> 00:35:00.648
Alright.
