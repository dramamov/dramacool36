WEBVTT

00:00:01.391 --> 00:00:02.391
Han Woo Jin?

00:00:03.961 --> 00:00:05.661
Pretty dramatic entrance, right?

00:00:06.661 --> 00:00:10.461
Why didn't you call first? You didn't know when I'd be back.

00:00:12.871 --> 00:00:14.531
I lost my phone.

00:00:15.101 --> 00:00:17.001
I think I left it in the airport bathroom.

00:00:18.001 --> 00:00:19.071
What about your luggage?

00:00:20.211 --> 00:00:21.781
I left without packing a thing.

00:00:22.611 --> 00:00:24.211
My grandfather passed away.

00:00:24.941 --> 00:00:26.111
I had to leave in a hurry.

00:00:27.911 --> 00:00:29.951
Your grandfather passed away?

00:00:30.921 --> 00:00:35.761
Yes. It's just... I booked a night train to Busan,

00:00:36.421 --> 00:00:37.791
and I had some time to kill.

00:00:38.991 --> 00:00:40.731
So, I just wanted to come and check on your place.

00:00:41.661 --> 00:00:43.431
I helped you move in here, remember?

00:00:45.971 --> 00:00:46.971
That's right.

00:00:47.831 --> 00:00:49.241
That was during your school break, right?

00:00:51.241 --> 00:00:52.471
What time's your train?

00:00:53.271 --> 00:00:55.181
Let's go inside and talk more.

00:00:56.481 --> 00:00:57.481
No, it's okay.

00:00:59.211 --> 00:01:00.881
How about we just sit over there for a little while?

00:01:03.821 --> 00:01:05.051
Aren't you cold?

00:01:14.291 --> 00:01:15.361
Han Woo Jin.

00:01:27.211 --> 00:01:28.341
By the way, Woo Jin,

00:01:29.311 --> 00:01:31.951
If I remember correctly, your dad runs a business, right?

00:01:33.281 --> 00:01:34.811
What kind of business was it again?

00:01:35.651 --> 00:01:36.981
Was it a company?

00:01:38.321 --> 00:01:39.821
You think every business is a big company?

00:01:41.321 --> 00:01:44.721
He runs a small factory. One that makes car parts.

00:01:46.031 --> 00:01:47.191
I see.

00:01:48.331 --> 00:01:49.461
And...

00:01:49.761 --> 00:01:52.331
you said your mother remarried, didn't you?

00:01:52.671 --> 00:01:54.101
- Well... - What?

00:01:55.271 --> 00:01:57.371
Where did you hear that nonsense?

00:01:59.871 --> 00:02:01.141
I guess not?

00:02:02.541 --> 00:02:05.381
Oh, I must be thinking of someone else.

00:02:11.521 --> 00:02:12.621
When's the burial?

00:02:13.951 --> 00:02:15.051
Tomorrow morning.

00:02:16.521 --> 00:02:17.521
Tomorrow?

00:02:19.691 --> 00:02:21.901
When are you coming back to Seoul?

00:02:22.531 --> 00:02:26.271
Since you don't have your phone, let's make plans before you go.

00:02:28.071 --> 00:02:29.501
I can't right now.

00:02:31.841 --> 00:02:33.841
I'm planning to get some rest while I'm there.

00:02:35.411 --> 00:02:36.481
For how long?

00:02:40.081 --> 00:02:41.181
Ten days at most, maybe?

00:02:42.521 --> 00:02:44.081
The semester just ended, anyway.

00:02:46.351 --> 00:02:48.321
Where will you stay?

00:02:49.021 --> 00:02:50.961
Do you have family near your grandfather's place?

00:02:52.291 --> 00:02:53.661
In a forest nearby...

00:02:55.931 --> 00:02:58.401
I was thinking of staying in a cabin or something.

00:03:03.541 --> 00:03:07.671
Get a new phone right after the funeral.

00:03:07.941 --> 00:03:10.211
And you have to call me right away.

00:03:13.281 --> 00:03:14.311
I will.

00:03:18.051 --> 00:03:19.191
I should get going.

00:03:22.091 --> 00:03:23.221
All right.

00:03:26.661 --> 00:03:27.691
Eun Oh.

00:03:28.931 --> 00:03:30.261
Listen. First, you should...

00:03:31.701 --> 00:03:35.701
find a man who loves you so much that he can't live without you.

00:03:37.541 --> 00:03:39.771
I mean, someone who really feels like he'd die.

00:03:41.211 --> 00:03:42.241
That kind of man.

00:03:44.081 --> 00:03:46.011
- What? - Someone who's affectionate,

00:03:47.151 --> 00:03:48.951
honest, and doesn't hold a grudge.

00:03:49.981 --> 00:03:51.521
Someone who's genuine.

00:03:56.021 --> 00:03:57.091
Hey.

00:03:57.761 --> 00:03:59.891
Where is this suddenly coming from?

00:04:00.291 --> 00:04:03.201
I'm just worried about you, now that you're in your 30s.

00:04:05.261 --> 00:04:07.471
Isn't it about time you went on some blind dates?

00:04:11.471 --> 00:04:12.541
Eun Oh,

00:04:14.041 --> 00:04:15.341
so you were her.

00:04:21.711 --> 00:04:23.221
Oh, that reminds me.

00:04:23.721 --> 00:04:25.851
What was that favour you were going to ask me?

00:04:28.761 --> 00:04:30.821
When we last spoke on the phone,

00:04:32.731 --> 00:04:34.091
you said your awful birth mother...

00:04:35.861 --> 00:04:38.061
only came for the liver transplant.

00:04:39.771 --> 00:04:41.101
Something along those lines, right?

00:04:53.281 --> 00:04:54.811
That's what I wanted to tell you. Absolutely do not do it.

00:04:56.521 --> 00:04:57.751
That's the favour I came to ask.

00:05:05.461 --> 00:05:06.731
I knew it.

00:05:08.161 --> 00:05:09.401
You're on my side.

00:05:11.661 --> 00:05:14.031
Everyone on my side is telling me not to do it.

00:05:15.841 --> 00:05:16.841
To be honest,

00:05:18.501 --> 00:05:20.771
someone's life depends on it,

00:05:21.071 --> 00:05:22.881
so I've been agonizing over it a little.

00:05:24.281 --> 00:05:25.951
She is my flesh and blood, after all.

00:05:26.451 --> 00:05:27.951
Flesh and blood? Give me a break.

00:05:28.381 --> 00:05:31.551
Family are the people you live with and grow to love.

00:05:32.421 --> 00:05:34.591
Like your mom and Gang Oh.

00:05:36.661 --> 00:05:39.331
Don't let some outdated thinking make you feel guilty.

00:05:40.531 --> 00:05:43.131
What if something happens to you? There's always a risk.

00:05:43.431 --> 00:05:44.801
Did you even think about that?

00:05:46.871 --> 00:05:47.871
You're right.

00:05:48.871 --> 00:05:51.740
That's why my mom, Ji Hyuk, and Su Jeong...

00:05:51.741 --> 00:05:53.211
They all tried to talk me out of it.

00:06:02.651 --> 00:06:03.721
I should get going.

00:06:05.281 --> 00:06:06.821
Man, I'm cutting it close.

00:06:07.321 --> 00:06:08.651
Okay. You'd better go then.

00:06:15.191 --> 00:06:16.201
Take care.

00:06:19.531 --> 00:06:20.531
Stay well.

00:06:26.041 --> 00:06:27.311
Yu Ra, I'm sorry.

00:06:28.011 --> 00:06:29.181
I'm truly sorry.

00:06:30.211 --> 00:06:32.311
I'm sorry I left you at the orphanage.

00:06:39.091 --> 00:06:41.321
I'm so glad that's not Woo Jin.

00:06:44.221 --> 00:06:47.591
But why does he keep popping up out of nowhere?

00:06:49.931 --> 00:06:52.401
- I'm home! - You're back?

00:06:52.431 --> 00:06:55.130
- Yes. - You left a while ago.

00:06:55.131 --> 00:06:56.371
What took you so long?

00:06:56.901 --> 00:06:59.341
Mom, I ran into Woo Jin.

00:06:59.741 --> 00:07:01.540
He was waiting for me right out front.

00:07:01.541 --> 00:07:04.411
What? Out front? Why didn't he come inside?

00:07:05.041 --> 00:07:08.921
His grandfather died unexpectedly. He's on his way to Busan.

00:07:09.381 --> 00:07:12.621
He had some time before his train, so he just stopped by.

00:07:13.151 --> 00:07:14.421
Doesn't he have a crush on you?

00:07:14.691 --> 00:07:16.491
Who comes all the way out here just to see a friend?

00:07:17.061 --> 00:07:19.861
Come on, I know all about his dating history.

00:07:20.061 --> 00:07:21.861
They've always been super close.

00:07:22.631 --> 00:07:25.701
But is his family from Busan originally?

00:07:27.371 --> 00:07:30.641
I'm not sure. I don't remember him mentioning it.

00:07:31.201 --> 00:07:34.311
He just never really talked about his home life.

00:07:35.141 --> 00:07:39.011
His dad owns a business, and his mom was a housewife.

00:07:39.881 --> 00:07:42.351
He said he had an older brother and a younger sister?

00:07:43.351 --> 00:07:45.281
And yet, he was always over at our house.

00:07:59.731 --> 00:08:03.001
Honey. Since you're working late, I'm going to head to bed.

00:08:03.401 --> 00:08:05.471
If I'm asleep when you get home, wake me up.

00:08:13.981 --> 00:08:16.621
What now? Why is he calling?

00:08:17.651 --> 00:08:18.651
(Han Cheong Ah)

00:08:18.651 --> 00:08:19.651
What?

00:08:21.551 --> 00:08:22.561
Hello?

00:08:22.961 --> 00:08:24.991
This is Cheong Ah University Hospital.

00:08:25.831 --> 00:08:27.591
What? Is something wrong with Woo Jin?

00:08:31.001 --> 00:08:32.231
What are you talking about?

00:08:40.571 --> 00:08:42.281
(To Mother)

00:08:46.051 --> 00:08:47.781
I'm writing this so you won't look for me.

00:08:48.981 --> 00:08:51.321
I wanted to just disappear and die without a word,

00:08:52.151 --> 00:08:53.951
but I knew you'd come looking for me.

00:08:54.891 --> 00:08:57.561
You will never see me again in this life.

00:08:58.461 --> 00:09:00.591
This is my ultimate revenge.

00:09:05.401 --> 00:09:06.871
That crazy brat...

00:09:12.001 --> 00:09:14.971
The phone is turned off. Please leave a message...

00:09:15.041 --> 00:09:18.541
His phone is off. We've been trying to reach him, too.

00:09:18.641 --> 00:09:21.611
Why didn't you call me the moment he left?

00:09:22.351 --> 00:09:25.651
He said he was just going home to get something.

00:09:27.091 --> 00:09:28.351
He's actually serious.

00:09:29.021 --> 00:09:30.021
If he's serious,

00:09:30.421 --> 00:09:34.631
he wouldn't have taken a phone the police could easily track.

00:09:37.301 --> 00:09:40.101
Who's in charge of the cleaning staff here?

00:09:43.171 --> 00:09:45.341
A patient suffering from depression has gone missing.

00:09:45.601 --> 00:09:50.381
Please check all trash cans in your areas for a cell phone.

00:09:54.881 --> 00:09:57.981
- Hey, I found a phone! Over here! - You found it?

00:09:58.351 --> 00:09:59.521
- Oh, my. - We finally found it.

00:09:59.921 --> 00:10:02.361
(Welcome!)

00:10:03.691 --> 00:10:05.791
What? What's wrong with this phone?

00:10:06.191 --> 00:10:08.191
It looks like Woo Jin deleted everything.

00:10:11.301 --> 00:10:13.001
I think he did a factory reset.

00:10:13.831 --> 00:10:14.831
A factory reset?

00:10:18.701 --> 00:10:19.711
Ma'am.

00:10:20.341 --> 00:10:23.111
What on earth happened? Why did Woo Jin disappear?

00:10:24.311 --> 00:10:25.851
He hasn't disappeared.

00:10:26.151 --> 00:10:29.021
He's been struggling mentally because of the upcoming surgery.

00:10:29.451 --> 00:10:31.451
Don't worry, Doctor. I'll find him.

00:10:31.721 --> 00:10:33.251
I'll make sure it doesn't interfere with his surgery.

00:10:39.031 --> 00:10:41.461
So you're at the funeral home in Pyeongtaek right now?

00:10:42.401 --> 00:10:43.401
Yes.

00:10:43.661 --> 00:10:47.301
But the teacher just arrived, so I'll be heading back soon.

00:10:47.901 --> 00:10:49.041
Don't wait up.

00:10:49.441 --> 00:10:52.001
Okay, sure. Drive safe.

00:10:55.141 --> 00:10:56.811
Why is Mom running late?

00:10:56.941 --> 00:11:00.311
One of the scholarship kids doesn't have any parents...

00:11:00.381 --> 00:11:02.081
and was living with their grandmother.

00:11:02.421 --> 00:11:03.751
And their grandmother just passed away.

00:11:04.521 --> 00:11:07.490
So Mom went all the way to the funeral home for them?

00:11:07.491 --> 00:11:10.520
Well, the kid didn't know what to do,

00:11:10.521 --> 00:11:12.021
so they called her for help.

00:11:13.091 --> 00:11:14.191
Sometimes, your mom...

00:11:14.731 --> 00:11:17.131
has certain kids she takes under her wing.

00:11:18.401 --> 00:11:21.001
He's really buying this?

00:11:22.541 --> 00:11:25.471
Your mother has a big heart. She just doesn't show it.

00:11:32.081 --> 00:11:33.211
This is insane.

00:11:34.651 --> 00:11:36.851
How can he trust Mom so blindly?

00:11:39.951 --> 00:11:43.361
My son needed a liver transplant, but the donor fell through.

00:11:43.461 --> 00:11:47.531
He's despondent and ran off. Find him fast. He may hurt himself.

00:11:48.831 --> 00:11:52.231
Please check all the CCTV footage, starting from the hospital entrance.

00:11:53.001 --> 00:11:54.871
- Please hurry. - Right away, ma'am.

00:11:55.531 --> 00:11:59.211
We'll obtain the CCTV footage and trace his movements.

00:11:59.971 --> 00:12:02.681
This is urgent. Please, you have to hurry.

00:12:03.111 --> 00:12:04.111
Understood.

00:12:11.621 --> 00:12:12.891
Tell them to work all night to recover the data.

00:12:13.191 --> 00:12:15.861
- I'll pay whatever it takes. - Understood.

00:12:21.491 --> 00:12:25.531
Woo Jin. You can't do this to me. Not after everything I've set up.

00:12:30.701 --> 00:12:33.171
- I hope you enjoyed your meal. - It was delicious. Good night.

00:12:33.271 --> 00:12:35.571
Take care. Thank you!

00:12:36.981 --> 00:12:38.241
Hey, Mr. Kim.

00:12:38.911 --> 00:12:41.011
Hey, Ji Hyuk. I'm seeing a lot of you these days.

00:12:41.581 --> 00:12:43.751
Yes, I park my car just over there.

00:12:44.081 --> 00:12:46.091
- I see. - But listen, why were you...

00:12:46.321 --> 00:12:48.721
bowing so deeply to kids that young?

00:12:49.861 --> 00:12:53.361
Business is terrible. I keep losing regulars.

00:12:53.891 --> 00:12:55.091
Really?

00:12:56.001 --> 00:12:59.401
Life's a grind. Looking as sharp as you isn't easy.

00:12:59.501 --> 00:13:00.671
You should head home and get some rest.

00:13:01.201 --> 00:13:04.141
Actually, I'm pretty thirsty. I'll have a quick beer before I go.

00:13:04.201 --> 00:13:06.811
- Can I get the house special too? - Yes, sure. Come on in.

00:13:09.841 --> 00:13:11.241
I can't join you for a drink, though.

00:13:11.611 --> 00:13:13.481
My wife's not feeling so well today.

00:13:13.811 --> 00:13:15.151
That's fine. I don't mind drinking alone.

00:13:15.921 --> 00:13:18.121
You'll never have a son if you pour your own drink, rascal.

00:13:18.521 --> 00:13:20.921
Dad, did you come in because you saw me?

00:13:21.721 --> 00:13:23.861
If I'd known you were here, I wouldn't have come in.

00:13:24.721 --> 00:13:26.691
I just happened to come in and find you here.

00:13:27.891 --> 00:13:29.661
Mr. Kim, could we get another glass, please?

00:13:29.731 --> 00:13:33.671
Sure. I guess your dad wanted a drink after Byeong Ho's death.

00:13:36.141 --> 00:13:37.141
Byeong Ho?

00:13:37.741 --> 00:13:41.241
Wait, the one who moved to Mexico? He passed away?

00:13:42.411 --> 00:13:43.411
Car accident.

00:13:45.011 --> 00:13:46.751
But he was your age, wasn't he, Dad?

00:13:47.251 --> 00:13:50.351
There's an order to birth, but not to death.

00:13:50.981 --> 00:13:52.951
Still, he was gone too soon.

00:13:55.291 --> 00:13:56.291
Thanks.

00:13:57.991 --> 00:13:58.991
Here you go, Dad.

00:14:21.511 --> 00:14:23.821
Is there something you wanted to say to me?

00:14:24.551 --> 00:14:27.151
What? Yes.

00:14:28.051 --> 00:14:30.761
I figured. You only came in because you saw me.

00:14:32.561 --> 00:14:33.561
It's just that...

00:14:36.831 --> 00:14:37.831
I'm sorry.

00:14:39.131 --> 00:14:40.131
What?

00:14:41.431 --> 00:14:43.171
What's that supposed to mean?

00:14:44.141 --> 00:14:46.911
Are you saying you're sorry because you finally kicked me out?

00:14:48.211 --> 00:14:50.141
So, you're happy now that I'm finally leaving?

00:14:50.681 --> 00:14:52.341
No, that's not it, you punk.

00:14:52.911 --> 00:14:53.951
I'm sorry...

00:14:54.251 --> 00:14:56.751
No. I'm sorry for what I did back then.

00:14:57.281 --> 00:14:58.321
What about you, Dad?

00:14:59.321 --> 00:15:00.951
When did you ever apologise to me?

00:15:01.551 --> 00:15:03.891
Did you ever say you were sorry? Not even once.

00:15:05.491 --> 00:15:06.831
You never said you were sorry.

00:15:08.531 --> 00:15:10.531
"Sorry I couldn't keep my promise, Ji Hyuk."

00:15:11.361 --> 00:15:12.701
"I'm sorry for what happened to your grandfather."

00:15:13.671 --> 00:15:16.471
You couldn't even say that one simple thing.

00:15:17.141 --> 00:15:18.141
Never.

00:15:18.201 --> 00:15:21.111
I never apologised for making you give up studying abroad.

00:15:22.411 --> 00:15:24.141
I'm sorry for not doing it back then,

00:15:25.011 --> 00:15:28.181
and I'm sorry for breaking my promise.

00:15:32.891 --> 00:15:35.521
Gosh, why are you bringing this up all of a sudden?

00:15:36.261 --> 00:15:41.031
Honestly, back then, my father's life was on the line,

00:15:41.591 --> 00:15:44.701
so I felt like I couldn't apologise to my own son.

00:15:46.131 --> 00:15:47.171
Because if I did,

00:15:48.171 --> 00:15:50.501
it would've felt like I was blaming my own sick father.

00:15:53.971 --> 00:15:54.971
Dad...

00:15:55.341 --> 00:15:56.341
But the truth is,

00:15:57.611 --> 00:15:59.781
I resented my own father for it, too.

00:16:01.451 --> 00:16:04.721
Your grandfather was rushed to the hospital this morning.

00:16:05.881 --> 00:16:07.521
It's an abdominal aortic aneurysm.

00:16:07.951 --> 00:16:10.261
It ruptured by 8cm, so he had to have surgery.

00:16:11.061 --> 00:16:15.291
Okay. But what does that have to do with me not studying abroad?

00:16:16.931 --> 00:16:19.431
- We need that money. - You can't be serious!

00:16:19.601 --> 00:16:22.431
What do you mean? Your grandfather's life is at stake.

00:16:23.541 --> 00:16:24.901
Hey, Ji Hyuk...

00:16:26.711 --> 00:16:27.711
That kid...

00:16:35.511 --> 00:16:38.581
It's raining, and he's out there without an umbrella...

00:16:41.521 --> 00:16:43.361
I'm so sorry, Ji Hyuk.

00:16:45.691 --> 00:16:48.491
Dad is so sorry, kiddo.

00:16:53.931 --> 00:16:54.971
Father.

00:16:56.841 --> 00:17:00.411
I told you again and again to quit smoking.

00:17:01.471 --> 00:17:03.341
Especially after you'd already damaged your lungs.

00:17:07.781 --> 00:17:09.881
So what am I supposed to do?

00:17:11.721 --> 00:17:13.191
What am I supposed to do?

00:17:14.821 --> 00:17:18.161
Must you make me the kind of father who crushes his son's dreams?

00:17:22.461 --> 00:17:24.961
That's been his dream since he was in ninth grade.

00:17:31.271 --> 00:17:32.471
I'm so sorry, Ji Hyuk.

00:17:34.671 --> 00:17:36.411
I'm so sorry!

00:17:42.851 --> 00:17:46.221
You studied so hard to study abroad, all while trusting in me.

00:17:47.321 --> 00:17:48.491
Then in your senior year, out of the blue...

00:17:49.251 --> 00:17:51.621
I was sorry I told you so suddenly, with no explanation.

00:17:53.461 --> 00:17:55.931
But back then, I didn't realise...

00:17:56.531 --> 00:18:00.401
that what made you so resentful wasn't that you couldn't go,

00:18:01.571 --> 00:18:03.741
but that I never even apologised.

00:18:06.441 --> 00:18:09.111
But why is he bringing this up now, after all this time?

00:18:11.541 --> 00:18:14.911
When you were drunk the other day, you said it all with such anguish.

00:18:16.011 --> 00:18:17.351
That's when I finally understood.

00:18:19.791 --> 00:18:20.791
But...

00:18:21.551 --> 00:18:24.791
after so long, it's not like "I'm sorry" just comes out easily.

00:18:25.621 --> 00:18:27.391
The mood has to be right for something like that.

00:18:35.631 --> 00:18:36.741
I get it, Dad.

00:18:38.541 --> 00:18:39.841
It's all in the past now,

00:18:40.611 --> 00:18:41.741
so don't worry about it.

00:18:44.581 --> 00:18:45.581
Okay.

00:18:46.381 --> 00:18:47.381
Thank you.

00:18:48.411 --> 00:18:49.411
Let me...

00:19:11.601 --> 00:19:13.911
What? So you really were cooking.

00:19:14.271 --> 00:19:15.871
When did you get here? How long have you been at it?

00:19:16.141 --> 00:19:20.081
How did you know it was me? I said I was sleeping in the study.

00:19:20.611 --> 00:19:24.621
I could smell your dried shrimp and perilla seed stew.

00:19:25.521 --> 00:19:28.591
I see. I got home at dawn and got a little shut-eye.

00:19:28.651 --> 00:19:31.361
Goodness. You should've slept in more, dear.

00:19:32.361 --> 00:19:35.531
It must've been exhausting to set up the funeral to help that student.

00:19:38.831 --> 00:19:41.001
And what brought you down so early, Yeong Ra?

00:19:41.771 --> 00:19:44.941
Oh, I smelled something delicious too.

00:19:45.871 --> 00:19:47.141
You must be exhausted, Mom.

00:19:48.211 --> 00:19:51.541
If you want breakfast, sit down. I have to eat and run too.

00:19:52.381 --> 00:19:55.311
I have my scalp treatment today, so I'm going there to relax.

00:19:55.381 --> 00:19:59.521
Good. That's a great idea. Okay, come on, sit down.

00:19:59.791 --> 00:20:00.791
Here you go.

00:20:10.801 --> 00:20:12.161
This is Eun Oh's neighbourhood, though.

00:20:13.171 --> 00:20:14.901
How would Woo Jin have known to come here?

00:20:15.001 --> 00:20:17.941
We tracked him getting out of a taxi here,

00:20:18.701 --> 00:20:22.871
but after he went into that alley, we lost him on the CCTV.

00:20:26.011 --> 00:20:30.281
He could've caught a cab in there, or walked a few blocks.

00:20:31.021 --> 00:20:32.651
Please look harder, Detective.

00:20:33.291 --> 00:20:35.191
If we waste any more time, he'll die.

00:20:35.521 --> 00:20:39.961
Please, widen the search radius and check the shop cameras too.

00:20:40.761 --> 00:20:43.601
If you need more people, I'll pay for everything, Detective.

00:20:44.961 --> 00:20:48.001
If he dies, I die too, Detective.

00:20:49.741 --> 00:20:50.741
Understood.

00:20:51.301 --> 00:20:53.741
We'll expand the radius and keep searching.

00:20:54.611 --> 00:20:55.771
Thank you.

00:20:56.111 --> 00:20:58.411
- Please. - Yes.

00:21:02.911 --> 00:21:04.751
(Ms. Shin)

00:21:04.821 --> 00:21:07.151
I'm at the data recovery service. The phone's data has been restored.

00:21:14.091 --> 00:21:15.231
Go wait outside.

00:21:23.041 --> 00:21:26.071
(Recents, Mom)

00:21:28.771 --> 00:21:30.581
(Chat, Mom)

00:21:30.641 --> 00:21:32.081
(Mom: Take your medicine and look after yourself.)

00:21:37.021 --> 00:21:38.281
(Ji Eun Oh)

00:21:38.351 --> 00:21:39.351
What's this?

00:21:42.521 --> 00:21:43.591
Ji Eun Oh?

00:21:45.561 --> 00:21:46.791
(Ji Eun Oh)

00:21:47.391 --> 00:21:48.391
(Voice Call)

00:21:51.931 --> 00:21:53.701
(Here's the picture Yeong Min took of us.)

00:22:06.411 --> 00:22:08.311
Woo Jin and Eun Oh were friends?

00:22:13.791 --> 00:22:17.521
(Hyunmyeong High School Days)

00:22:41.751 --> 00:22:42.851
Ms. Shin!

00:22:47.691 --> 00:22:48.691
Ms. Shin.

00:22:49.421 --> 00:22:52.691
Why didn't you tell me Ji Eun Oh went to Hyunmyeong High School?

00:22:53.021 --> 00:22:56.601
You said you didn't need to know about her life before college.

00:22:57.031 --> 00:22:59.131
Her adoptive parents' occupations, her family relationships,

00:22:59.261 --> 00:23:02.131
her university, major, and her work history after college.

00:23:02.271 --> 00:23:04.000
And if dating, only her boyfriend's details.

00:23:04.001 --> 00:23:05.671
Those were your instructions.

00:23:06.171 --> 00:23:10.411
- I said that? - Yes, when we discussed Cafe Agit.

00:23:11.041 --> 00:23:13.911
- That's when I got the case. - That I didn't need to know?

00:23:16.081 --> 00:23:17.081
I guess I did.

00:23:18.151 --> 00:23:19.721
I didn't need it then.

00:23:20.521 --> 00:23:21.591
Go wait outside.

00:23:35.331 --> 00:23:36.601
Okay. This is a lifesaver.

00:23:41.411 --> 00:23:44.741
As you can see in the proposal, out of 100 customers browsing,

00:23:45.111 --> 00:23:48.781
we want 80 to find a style they like among our 30 sample homes.

00:23:49.081 --> 00:23:51.651
In addition to antique, Zen, and French styles,

00:23:51.721 --> 00:23:54.151
we'll have a grandma's house style, a European home style,

00:23:54.251 --> 00:23:55.791
and styles with colour accents.

00:23:57.291 --> 00:24:00.861
So you're proposing 30 conceptual model homes?

00:24:00.991 --> 00:24:04.401
Exactly. Designs we can only create using our AP materials,

00:24:04.501 --> 00:24:06.401
making them conceptual interior sample homes.

00:24:13.171 --> 00:24:14.341
You should file a report first.

00:24:19.211 --> 00:24:20.311
You and I need to talk.

00:24:22.451 --> 00:24:25.151
Ms. Ji. What do you want to do?

00:24:26.321 --> 00:24:27.491
I'll handle this.

00:24:39.761 --> 00:24:42.131
What is it this time? Let's make this quick.

00:24:42.471 --> 00:24:44.371
Go on. Play your card.

00:24:48.371 --> 00:24:50.741
This time, it's the face of the brother you're about to kill.

00:24:52.141 --> 00:24:54.081
You should at least see the face of the person you're killing.

00:24:54.611 --> 00:24:56.951
Know exactly who it is you're killing.

00:25:06.631 --> 00:25:08.161
I'm not curious.

00:25:34.621 --> 00:25:37.521
Well? Does he look killable to you?

00:25:38.561 --> 00:25:39.591
This guy...

00:25:41.431 --> 00:25:44.131
Is he really my brother?

00:25:46.431 --> 00:25:47.431
Yes.

00:25:50.271 --> 00:25:51.441
Han Woo Jin.

00:25:52.541 --> 00:25:56.571
And your name was Han Yu Ra.

00:26:00.111 --> 00:26:01.381
Turns out, the two of you were friends.

00:26:03.281 --> 00:26:05.481
You two really are fated, aren't you?

00:26:07.251 --> 00:26:10.221
But what a shame. After he heard you refused the transplant,

00:26:10.291 --> 00:26:11.961
he wrote a suicide note and disappeared.

00:26:12.261 --> 00:26:13.791
He said he was going off to die alone.

00:26:14.561 --> 00:26:17.131
He wiped his phone, left his bag,

00:26:17.201 --> 00:26:18.901
and just disappeared with nothing.

00:26:20.331 --> 00:26:24.001
Out of despair, I imagine. How could he possibly bear it?

00:26:24.271 --> 00:26:26.271
He almost had a chance to live, and now he has to die.

00:26:27.471 --> 00:26:29.471
I lost my phone.

00:26:29.811 --> 00:26:31.740
I think I left it in the airport bathroom.

00:26:31.741 --> 00:26:35.351
My grandfather passed away. I had to leave in a hurry.

00:26:35.651 --> 00:26:37.420
You said your awful birth mother...

00:26:37.421 --> 00:26:39.181
only came for the liver transplant.

00:26:39.751 --> 00:26:41.350
Something along those lines, right?

00:26:41.351 --> 00:26:42.951
That's what I wanted to tell you. Absolutely do not do it.

00:26:46.561 --> 00:26:47.931
That's the favour I came to ask.

00:26:51.631 --> 00:26:52.801
Take care.

00:26:55.471 --> 00:26:56.531
Stay well.

00:26:58.641 --> 00:27:00.341
So that's what that was all about.

00:27:03.511 --> 00:27:05.111
Is there anywhere Woo Jin would go?

00:27:05.211 --> 00:27:07.951
The last we saw was him on CCTV exiting a cab in your neighbourhood.

00:27:08.951 --> 00:27:12.521
He's decided to die somewhere alone, where no one can find him.

00:27:14.151 --> 00:27:15.291
And it's all because of you.

00:27:22.561 --> 00:27:24.561
You are Woo Jin's mother?

00:27:24.631 --> 00:27:28.101
If you'd cooperated earlier, this never would've happened.

00:27:29.801 --> 00:27:31.041
Find Woo Jin.

00:27:33.341 --> 00:27:34.641
I'm out of options.

00:27:35.641 --> 00:27:39.381
So, you need to rack your brain and find him.

00:27:44.751 --> 00:27:45.981
Take responsibility and find him.

00:27:48.991 --> 00:27:53.291
He's like this. That's why I hid it. Because he's so fragile.

00:27:55.461 --> 00:27:57.261
He's probably dying somewhere as we speak.

00:27:59.901 --> 00:28:01.071
Are you satisfied now?

00:28:09.211 --> 00:28:10.381
(Team Leader's Office)

00:28:30.701 --> 00:28:33.131
He didn't say anything to me, right up to the end.

00:28:34.371 --> 00:28:37.571
He never said he was my brother or that I was his sister.

00:28:38.841 --> 00:28:40.541
He just told me to live a good life.

00:28:42.041 --> 00:28:43.941
He patted my head and then he left.

00:28:44.941 --> 00:28:46.081
What do I do?

00:28:46.741 --> 00:28:48.111
He should have said something.

00:28:52.221 --> 00:28:54.091
He stopped by on his way to die.

00:28:55.121 --> 00:28:57.461
He came to see me one last time.

00:28:58.621 --> 00:29:00.461
Woo Jin had no idea.

00:29:01.131 --> 00:29:03.831
That his mother would find out about our relationship.

00:29:04.231 --> 00:29:06.401
That's why he left, keeping it all to himself.

00:29:08.101 --> 00:29:09.371
He thought if he was the only one to die,

00:29:09.631 --> 00:29:12.341
then I would never find out the truth.

00:29:13.201 --> 00:29:15.311
I can't imagine what that must've felt like for him.

00:29:15.811 --> 00:29:18.141
Poor Woo Jin. How heartbreaking.

00:29:19.711 --> 00:29:20.881
He told me...

00:29:21.911 --> 00:29:25.721
to promise I'd never go through with the liver transplant.

00:29:26.521 --> 00:29:29.421
He told me not to give in to my cruel birth mother's request.

00:29:30.191 --> 00:29:31.861
But he was the one...

00:29:32.361 --> 00:29:34.191
He was the one who needed it.

00:29:35.261 --> 00:29:39.561
How could he throw his life away? How could he do that?

00:29:40.231 --> 00:29:41.801
What do I do?

00:29:42.101 --> 00:29:43.771
What are you going to do?

00:29:48.611 --> 00:29:51.581
What about Woo Jin... What do I do?

00:29:54.851 --> 00:29:56.551
What do I do?

00:29:58.981 --> 00:30:00.251
What's Eun Oh's plan?

00:30:00.821 --> 00:30:05.091
She's calling their mutual friends and thinking of places he might go.

00:30:07.561 --> 00:30:09.191
Man, she must be a wreck.

00:30:09.761 --> 00:30:11.361
Is there anything we can do to help?

00:30:12.631 --> 00:30:15.201
Realistically, there's nothing we can do.

00:30:16.671 --> 00:30:19.141
Seriously, watching Eun Oh sob her heart out,

00:30:19.641 --> 00:30:22.541
it almost felt like a good thing that woman abandoned her.

00:30:25.041 --> 00:30:26.081
I know.

00:30:26.981 --> 00:30:28.851
It's because of the parents she has now.

00:30:29.411 --> 00:30:30.851
That's how she grew into the person she is.

00:30:35.721 --> 00:30:36.721
Yes.

00:30:45.701 --> 00:30:46.701
Are you okay?

00:30:47.631 --> 00:30:48.631
I'm okay.

00:30:51.241 --> 00:30:53.841
There are no words for what you're going through.

00:30:54.871 --> 00:30:56.011
Nothing I can say will help.

00:31:05.351 --> 00:31:07.251
Okay. Hang in there.

00:31:30.711 --> 00:31:32.081
(Resume, Name: Lee Sang Cheol)

00:31:32.141 --> 00:31:34.081
So you can run a half-marathon.

00:31:34.851 --> 00:31:36.511
You must be in excellent shape.

00:31:36.881 --> 00:31:37.881
Yes.

00:31:38.581 --> 00:31:41.191
Even with a liberal arts degree, in less than six months,

00:31:41.451 --> 00:31:44.691
I passed the practical exam for an electrician's license.

00:31:44.961 --> 00:31:48.091
Plus, I worked at 1 company for 33 years until retirement.

00:31:48.391 --> 00:31:52.761
I just hope you'll consider my perseverance and my work ethic.

00:31:53.261 --> 00:31:54.271
Right.

00:31:54.571 --> 00:31:56.971
That's why we called you in for an interview.

00:31:58.001 --> 00:31:59.501
You won't regret it. I promise.

00:32:12.621 --> 00:32:16.521
A new face joins special training for the next fashion show.

00:32:17.121 --> 00:32:20.491
This is Ms. Jo Ok Rye, who will walk with us in the show,

00:32:21.191 --> 00:32:24.101
and from our advanced class, we have Ms. Kim Yeong Ja...

00:32:24.601 --> 00:32:25.831
and Ms. Sim Deok Hui.

00:32:26.631 --> 00:32:28.971
Hello, everyone. I'm Jo Ok Rye.

00:32:29.701 --> 00:32:31.501
I'm actually in the beginner class,

00:32:32.501 --> 00:32:36.311
- so I'm not sure I should be here. - Of course, you should be.

00:32:36.871 --> 00:32:37.981
It's nice to meet you, Ok Rye.

00:32:40.711 --> 00:32:43.880
Left.

00:32:43.881 --> 00:32:45.421
And turn!

00:32:45.681 --> 00:32:48.221
And right.

00:32:48.791 --> 00:32:52.821
Right and turn! And pose.

00:32:54.291 --> 00:32:57.301
Great. Let's take it from the top.

00:32:59.231 --> 00:33:02.731
Two, three. Left.

00:33:03.101 --> 00:33:05.471
Left and turn!

00:33:10.171 --> 00:33:13.041
- Grandma. Are you okay? - I'm so dizzy.

00:33:13.951 --> 00:33:14.951
My gosh.

00:33:15.381 --> 00:33:19.351
My goodness. Because I'm dressed differently,

00:33:19.421 --> 00:33:21.451
why won't my limbs listen to me?

00:33:21.991 --> 00:33:24.821
My arms and legs are flailing all over the place.

00:33:25.261 --> 00:33:27.831
I don't know if I can do this.

00:33:28.691 --> 00:33:29.931
You'll do great, Grandma.

00:33:32.561 --> 00:33:35.501
You're doing much better than I did when I started.

00:33:35.701 --> 00:33:37.141
Yeong Ja.

00:33:37.671 --> 00:33:39.171
I have a slipped disc.

00:33:39.571 --> 00:33:42.711
So at first, I couldn't even stand up straight.

00:33:43.411 --> 00:33:45.411
You're already doing so well, Ok Rye,

00:33:45.681 --> 00:33:48.181
so if you just take it step by step, you'll be great.

00:33:49.281 --> 00:33:50.621
Thank you.

00:33:51.321 --> 00:33:52.381
Thank you.

00:33:53.251 --> 00:33:54.921
Since we're all in this show together,

00:33:55.251 --> 00:33:56.921
I promise I won't mess it up.

00:33:58.891 --> 00:34:00.691
Let's do this!

00:34:00.961 --> 00:34:01.961
Let's do this!

00:34:08.871 --> 00:34:11.041
I'm officially a model now.

00:34:12.071 --> 00:34:15.641
And it's all your fault, Jang Su. My poor legs are about to give out.

00:34:17.681 --> 00:34:20.951
Wow, that was fast. Congratulations!

00:34:21.311 --> 00:34:23.011
I knew you had it in you.

00:34:25.951 --> 00:34:28.651
(Vice President Park Seong Jae)

00:34:32.891 --> 00:34:33.891
Mr. Oh.

00:34:34.661 --> 00:34:36.031
The lining on this new product...

00:34:36.591 --> 00:34:38.031
Are you sure it's 3A grade?

00:34:38.501 --> 00:34:40.501
Yes, sir. We always use 3A grade.

00:34:40.601 --> 00:34:41.901
You didn't change suppliers, did you?

00:34:42.271 --> 00:34:45.201
No, sir. We've worked with them for over 15 years.

00:34:47.071 --> 00:34:48.341
Feel it for yourself.

00:34:49.271 --> 00:34:50.371
These two feel different.

00:34:50.441 --> 00:34:53.951
(Shoealls)

00:35:02.651 --> 00:35:05.061
The lining that goes into our shoes...

00:35:05.291 --> 00:35:07.861
must be 3A grade, no exceptions!

00:35:08.931 --> 00:35:11.331
So why am I finding 2A grade in our shoes?

00:35:11.601 --> 00:35:14.101
I'm sorry, Mr. Chairman. It wasn't the entire batch.

00:35:14.771 --> 00:35:16.731
We were short on the second production run,

00:35:17.201 --> 00:35:19.671
so we had to use 2A for part of the batch.

00:35:20.001 --> 00:35:21.641
I'm truly sorry.

00:35:22.341 --> 00:35:23.341
Vice President.

00:35:24.111 --> 00:35:26.581
Stop production on the second batch at the factory.

00:35:27.041 --> 00:35:28.981
And during inspection, reject anything below 3A.

00:35:30.351 --> 00:35:31.351
Yes, sir.

00:35:31.951 --> 00:35:36.221
And contact the companies that want to supply for us.

00:35:36.351 --> 00:35:37.790
Find a new lining supplier.

00:35:37.791 --> 00:35:39.761
Sir! Please give us just one more chance.

00:35:39.921 --> 00:35:42.591
It'll never happen again. This was the only time.

00:35:43.431 --> 00:35:47.631
Someone who cheats you once was always capable of cheating.

00:35:48.171 --> 00:35:50.301
And they'll do it again whenever they get the chance.

00:35:52.471 --> 00:35:54.741
You dare to lie to me? To Park Jin Seok?

00:35:55.341 --> 00:35:57.541
- You lie to my company? - Mr. Chairman!

00:35:59.211 --> 00:36:00.341
Sir, please...

00:36:00.851 --> 00:36:04.351
Please, think of the 17 years I've worked for you.

00:36:05.181 --> 00:36:07.521
- Seventeen Years. - Okay, so what?

00:36:08.551 --> 00:36:10.121
What if it were 30 years?

00:36:10.791 --> 00:36:11.921
You still lied to me.

00:36:13.821 --> 00:36:15.891
Vice President, get this man out of my sight.

00:36:16.291 --> 00:36:19.101
- Please, just this once, sir! - Get him out!

00:36:29.211 --> 00:36:31.511
(CEO Park Jin Seok)

00:36:33.581 --> 00:36:35.811
What a pain.

00:36:41.551 --> 00:36:42.921
Honey?

00:36:44.061 --> 00:36:45.561
I'll be late. Something came up.

00:36:47.661 --> 00:36:48.661
What's wrong?

00:36:53.601 --> 00:36:56.171
What's with him now? This is making me anxious.

00:36:59.501 --> 00:37:01.171
He didn't sound like his usual self.

00:37:13.521 --> 00:37:16.321
Yeong Ra, are you getting tired? You can stop if you are.

00:37:16.621 --> 00:37:17.891
No, I'm fine.

00:37:18.621 --> 00:37:19.721
This is so much fun.

00:37:27.671 --> 00:37:29.231
Is there anything you can't do?

00:37:30.501 --> 00:37:32.701
Come on, this is a piece of cake for a guy like me.

00:37:34.371 --> 00:37:37.241
- Yeolmu. - I'll check that Yeolmu post.

00:37:37.311 --> 00:37:38.311
Okay.

00:37:40.751 --> 00:37:42.551
Oh, it's an electric kettle.

00:37:43.851 --> 00:37:45.121
"Giving away?" What does that mean?

00:37:45.251 --> 00:37:48.191
Hey, we should claim that fast. It's free.

00:37:49.291 --> 00:37:52.561
People are so generous, giving this stuff away for free.

00:37:52.721 --> 00:37:54.991
Yes. You'd be surprised how many give stuff away for free.

00:37:55.731 --> 00:37:56.731
Really?

00:37:57.501 --> 00:37:58.531
They said to come pick it up now.

00:37:58.831 --> 00:38:01.271
We're all done, so let's head out. You've got to get home, right?

00:38:01.601 --> 00:38:04.771
- I'll wait outside. Go get changed. - Okay.

00:38:13.181 --> 00:38:14.951
My first studio, paid for with my own money.

00:38:16.381 --> 00:38:17.381
Here's to a new beginning.

00:38:27.561 --> 00:38:29.091
I really love the vibe here.

00:38:30.961 --> 00:38:33.761
I want to put this in my webtoon. Maybe I can get a story out of this.

00:38:34.271 --> 00:38:36.431
That's the artist in you talking, Yeong Ra.

00:38:36.831 --> 00:38:38.640
When you see something you like, you want to draw it.

00:38:38.641 --> 00:38:39.701
I know, right?

00:38:39.941 --> 00:38:42.311
I can't help but see everything as material for my webtoon.

00:38:44.011 --> 00:38:46.781
And you still can't admit you want to do this for a living?

00:38:48.411 --> 00:38:50.511
That's because I don't think Dad would ever approve.

00:38:53.021 --> 00:38:56.221
Still, you'll have to decide sooner or later.

00:38:57.561 --> 00:38:58.561
Why?

00:38:58.891 --> 00:38:59.921
That's just how life is.

00:39:00.621 --> 00:39:02.561
It doesn't let you put things off forever.

00:39:03.631 --> 00:39:06.101
So you should really start thinking about it.

00:39:08.801 --> 00:39:09.801
You're right.

00:39:10.941 --> 00:39:14.111
I think I'll know for sure once I finish this series.

00:39:14.941 --> 00:39:16.811
Just how far I can really take this.

00:39:26.881 --> 00:39:28.551
Hey, Seong Jae.

00:39:29.121 --> 00:39:30.791
Why does your father look so upset?

00:39:33.321 --> 00:39:37.231
That jerk, Choi, used a lower-grade lining.

00:39:38.061 --> 00:39:39.061
Lining?

00:39:39.531 --> 00:39:42.731
My gosh. But we've been working with them for almost 20 years.

00:39:42.801 --> 00:39:43.801
Exactly.

00:39:44.571 --> 00:39:47.371
I cut them off immediately, reorganised the factory line,

00:39:47.741 --> 00:39:50.141
and met with new suppliers. It's been absolute chaos.

00:39:52.041 --> 00:39:54.811
Wait, you replaced them completely?

00:39:55.111 --> 00:39:57.451
Of course, I did. You know me better than that.

00:39:58.151 --> 00:40:02.321
The people I hate most are cheaters. Liars.

00:40:05.291 --> 00:40:08.991
So, you and Seong Jae handled this together?

00:40:09.961 --> 00:40:11.101
Seong Jae was the one who found it.

00:40:11.931 --> 00:40:14.061
The subtle difference between 3A and 2A grade.

00:40:16.331 --> 00:40:17.571
I'm going to head upstairs.

00:40:17.871 --> 00:40:20.811
Yes, good work today. Go get some rest.

00:40:32.881 --> 00:40:35.951
My blood is still boiling. Honey, some plum tea, please.

00:40:36.091 --> 00:40:39.521
Okay, I'll get it. Why don't you go wash up first?

00:40:41.331 --> 00:40:42.561
How dare he try to deceive me?

00:40:45.231 --> 00:40:47.701
This is why you can never fully trust anyone.

00:40:48.701 --> 00:40:49.701
Darn it.

00:40:58.981 --> 00:41:00.811
I used to resent my parents a lot,

00:41:01.551 --> 00:41:02.811
but she's on a whole other level.

00:41:05.151 --> 00:41:06.721
You should hurry up and find your own place.

00:41:07.081 --> 00:41:08.491
If you move out, you won't have to argue anymore.

00:41:11.821 --> 00:41:14.191
So, are things better with your parents?

00:41:14.491 --> 00:41:16.791
Hardly. We're just living apart now.

00:41:18.631 --> 00:41:21.001
Ji Hyuk, maybe it's time for you to move out.

00:41:21.401 --> 00:41:24.241
Your dad isn't the only one hurting. I am, too.

00:41:24.941 --> 00:41:27.341
If you're going to disrespect me, why won't you move out?

00:41:27.641 --> 00:41:29.811
You made me feel like I've wasted my life!

00:41:30.311 --> 00:41:31.881
As the head of this family! As a father!

00:41:32.641 --> 00:41:33.981
"Just living apart."

00:41:36.151 --> 00:41:37.151
We'd just grow further apart.

00:41:37.651 --> 00:41:40.421
Wait, the one who moved to Mexico? He passed away?

00:41:41.951 --> 00:41:43.621
But he was your age, wasn't he, Dad?

00:41:44.191 --> 00:41:47.161
There's an order to birth, but not to death.

00:41:54.331 --> 00:41:56.571
- I'm home. - Ji Hyuk.

00:41:56.871 --> 00:41:58.171
Go on upstairs and get some rest.

00:41:58.671 --> 00:42:02.871
Gosh, you always tell me to go rest. Here, let me help you with that.

00:42:05.181 --> 00:42:07.111
Hey, what do you think you're doing?

00:42:07.511 --> 00:42:09.551
Go on, get some rest. What's gotten into you?

00:42:10.181 --> 00:42:11.181
Some of my clothes are in here.

00:42:11.481 --> 00:42:16.021
I'll take mine and fold them. And I'll do Dad's as a bonus.

00:42:16.751 --> 00:42:18.621
What's gotten into you? This is so unlike you.

00:42:19.191 --> 00:42:20.861
Mom, you said I was making it hard on you.

00:42:21.261 --> 00:42:22.491
So, this is me, helping out.

00:42:23.061 --> 00:42:25.901
Hey, did what I said upset you?

00:42:26.201 --> 00:42:28.801
No, your son's not that petty.

00:42:29.401 --> 00:42:34.001
From now on, I'll clean my own room. Don't even worry about the upstairs.

00:42:34.101 --> 00:42:35.111
I'll take care of all of it.

00:42:35.941 --> 00:42:38.811
Why? Feeling guilty about moving out?

00:42:39.181 --> 00:42:40.881
No, I'm not moving out.

00:42:41.551 --> 00:42:43.481
Actually, I'm just going to stay here at home.

00:42:44.251 --> 00:42:46.721
You're not moving out? Why not?

00:42:47.451 --> 00:42:50.321
I figure I'll move out when I get married.

00:42:50.821 --> 00:42:54.331
- Married? - "Married?" What do you mean?

00:42:56.031 --> 00:42:57.631
Are you getting married?

00:42:58.231 --> 00:43:01.071
Honey, Ji Hyuk says he's not moving out.

00:43:01.401 --> 00:43:02.401
That's not the point.

00:43:03.401 --> 00:43:04.871
He just said he was getting married.

00:43:05.201 --> 00:43:07.971
Hey, hold on, you two. Just hear me out first.

00:43:09.311 --> 00:43:10.771
I don't want to move out right now.

00:43:11.341 --> 00:43:13.741
I'm just saying it'd be ideal to move out when I get married.

00:43:14.281 --> 00:43:15.681
So you found someone to marry?

00:43:17.051 --> 00:43:20.991
No. But I did find someone I want to marry.

00:43:21.221 --> 00:43:25.591
- Gosh, Ji Hyuk, you're dating! - So when's the wedding?

00:43:27.091 --> 00:43:29.961
Come on, I don't know. We're not even dating yet.

00:43:30.461 --> 00:43:31.461
What?

00:43:32.061 --> 00:43:34.261
It's just a one-sided thing.

00:43:34.801 --> 00:43:37.671
One-sided? So, you have an unrequited love?

00:43:38.241 --> 00:43:40.501
You're so outgoing. Why didn't you tell her?

00:43:41.911 --> 00:43:44.141
I did, and she turned me down.

00:43:44.981 --> 00:43:45.981
What? She turned you down?

00:43:46.481 --> 00:43:49.551
How could anyone reject you? Who is this woman anyway?

00:43:51.521 --> 00:43:52.521
She's someone who...

00:43:54.121 --> 00:43:55.351
She was at my wedding.

00:43:58.261 --> 00:43:59.691
You get the picture, right?

00:44:00.621 --> 00:44:01.631
Ji Hyuk.

00:44:01.991 --> 00:44:04.561
Then that ship has sailed. You should move on.

00:44:04.901 --> 00:44:07.401
But then, what's all this about getting married and moving out?

00:44:08.871 --> 00:44:11.171
Anyway, I'm not moving out until I'm married.

00:44:11.241 --> 00:44:12.941
You telling me to move out just makes me want to stay more.

00:44:13.001 --> 00:44:14.611
- Good night! - Hey!

00:44:14.671 --> 00:44:15.671
What's with him?

00:44:17.371 --> 00:44:22.051
Seriously, why does he want to stay? He's not even comfortable with me.

00:44:22.381 --> 00:44:24.311
I guess he loves his mom enough to stay.

00:44:25.081 --> 00:44:27.721
He's so stubborn. Why insist on not moving out?

00:44:28.451 --> 00:44:31.361
Who would want a man who was left at the altar?

00:44:32.321 --> 00:44:34.091
Poor Ji Hyuk must be really hurting inside.

00:44:42.131 --> 00:44:44.171
He won't move out?

00:44:52.341 --> 00:44:53.681
I'll have a beer too, please.

00:44:55.881 --> 00:44:58.721
Come to think of it, he was a little strange that day.

00:45:00.521 --> 00:45:03.151
I wonder if this is his way of trying to make an effort.

00:45:09.331 --> 00:45:11.031
What is it about this room?

00:45:11.901 --> 00:45:13.301
It's doing everything it can to keep me here.

00:45:20.471 --> 00:45:21.641
Still no word from him?

00:45:23.741 --> 00:45:26.781
Got it. Yeong In, I'll explain later.

00:45:27.141 --> 00:45:28.151
All right.

00:45:31.321 --> 00:45:33.321
Woo Jin, where are you?

00:45:33.951 --> 00:45:35.451
Are you really thinking of killing yourself?

00:45:35.991 --> 00:45:37.591
Where would you want to die?

00:45:38.691 --> 00:45:39.761
If I were Woo Jin,

00:45:40.721 --> 00:45:42.361
where would I want to die?

00:45:43.661 --> 00:45:45.561
Where would I want to die?

00:45:47.161 --> 00:45:48.271
They say twins...

00:45:49.301 --> 00:45:51.271
have a special connection.

00:45:52.401 --> 00:45:53.701
In a forest nearby...

00:45:56.041 --> 00:45:58.281
I was thinking of staying in a cabin or something.

00:46:02.911 --> 00:46:03.911
A cabin?

00:46:04.921 --> 00:46:05.921
A forest?

00:46:06.551 --> 00:46:10.521
- You only do it once. No. - This makes it juicier.

00:46:10.591 --> 00:46:11.790
- I told you to leave it alone! - No.

00:46:11.791 --> 00:46:13.560
- Hey, listen to me. Listen. - That's what my mom said.

00:46:13.561 --> 00:46:16.091
- What are you doing? - Well, she said to flip it often.

00:46:16.191 --> 00:46:18.430
- No, leave it. - Just leave it alone.

00:46:18.431 --> 00:46:20.631
- Stop. - What is this? Where's Han Woo Jin?

00:46:21.031 --> 00:46:23.201
- I don't know. I haven't seen him. - Maybe he went to the restroom?

00:46:23.271 --> 00:46:24.701
- No, I said to just leave it alone! - Okay.

00:46:24.971 --> 00:46:27.301
- Let me... - Min Jeong, calm down. Here.

00:46:32.081 --> 00:46:33.081
My gosh.

00:46:38.051 --> 00:46:39.881
Hey, why aren't you helping out...

00:46:40.481 --> 00:46:41.851
and just brooding all by yourself?

00:46:43.591 --> 00:46:45.821
Whenever I come here, I just feel like being quiet.

00:46:48.591 --> 00:46:50.231
This is my first time in the woods in winter,

00:46:50.791 --> 00:46:52.361
but the air is so crisp and nice.

00:46:53.431 --> 00:46:55.131
So how did you find a place like this?

00:46:56.331 --> 00:46:57.831
This is my favourite place.

00:46:58.971 --> 00:47:01.341
I used to come here every year around my birthday.

00:47:03.541 --> 00:47:04.541
With your dad?

00:47:06.811 --> 00:47:08.711
Looks like you have many memories with your dad, too.

00:47:12.581 --> 00:47:13.921
I suppose so.

00:47:15.851 --> 00:47:18.261
There you go again, being all vague, Han Woo Jin.

00:47:19.391 --> 00:47:21.261
You could've just said yes.

00:47:21.661 --> 00:47:23.991
You know you have a habit of being evasive sometimes?

00:47:24.761 --> 00:47:27.261
And don't think it makes you sound cool.

00:47:30.031 --> 00:47:31.031
You caught me.

00:47:35.271 --> 00:47:37.141
What was that place called again?

00:47:41.281 --> 00:47:45.721
(Apfel Kitchen)

00:47:45.781 --> 00:47:47.081
Hello, Yurim Forest Garden.

00:47:47.321 --> 00:47:50.091
Hi, yes. I was wondering if you had a guest yesterday...

00:47:50.151 --> 00:47:51.821
named Han Woo Jin?

00:47:52.221 --> 00:47:53.221
No.

00:47:54.661 --> 00:47:58.831
Did a young man check in alone, maybe under a different name?

00:47:59.231 --> 00:48:00.831
It's urgent. I really need to find him.

00:48:01.331 --> 00:48:02.801
We don't have any guests today.

00:48:08.071 --> 00:48:11.071
If he's not there, then where did he go?

00:48:12.081 --> 00:48:13.341
Where are you, Han Woo Jin?

00:48:16.281 --> 00:48:19.221
(Apfel Kitchen)

00:48:19.281 --> 00:48:20.281
Yes.

00:48:21.821 --> 00:48:22.821
Hey.

00:48:26.391 --> 00:48:29.061
- What's up? - I need to ask you something.

00:48:29.691 --> 00:48:30.691
Ji Hyuk,

00:48:31.431 --> 00:48:34.131
if you really wanted to die, where do you think you'd go?

00:48:36.771 --> 00:48:38.941
I can't think of anywhere Woo Jin would go.

00:48:39.701 --> 00:48:42.371
I'm so terrified that something's already happened,

00:48:43.211 --> 00:48:44.211
but I can't predict what he'd do.

00:48:45.541 --> 00:48:46.541
Where have you checked so far?

00:48:48.911 --> 00:48:51.451
I guess you've called everyone you can think of.

00:48:54.791 --> 00:48:55.851
If it were me...

00:48:57.321 --> 00:48:58.591
I can only speak for myself.

00:48:59.021 --> 00:49:02.161
I wouldn't want my last moments spent in Seoul.

00:49:03.331 --> 00:49:05.061
Remember how I left for Cheongpo?

00:49:05.861 --> 00:49:06.861
I...

00:49:07.631 --> 00:49:09.071
wanted to die back then too.

00:49:10.701 --> 00:49:13.471
Even if I were going to die, I had to get away from here.

00:49:15.071 --> 00:49:16.071
Well...

00:49:16.441 --> 00:49:18.711
There was one place just like that, so I called them.

00:49:19.111 --> 00:49:22.251
But they said no one like Woo Jin was there.

00:49:22.851 --> 00:49:23.911
He could be on his way there now.

00:49:25.381 --> 00:49:26.381
What?

00:49:27.081 --> 00:49:28.321
If you know where it is, you should go.

00:49:28.691 --> 00:49:29.691
That way, you won't have any regrets.

00:49:33.761 --> 00:49:35.131
Do you want me to go with you?

00:49:35.761 --> 00:49:37.391
Is there anything else I can do to help?

00:49:40.061 --> 00:49:41.061
It's okay.

00:49:41.801 --> 00:49:43.401
I'll go by myself.

00:49:45.341 --> 00:49:46.341
Hold on.

00:49:48.311 --> 00:49:50.311
(Apfel Kitchen)

00:49:52.881 --> 00:49:53.941
Here, take this.

00:49:57.111 --> 00:49:58.981
Come on, at least take this.

00:50:05.261 --> 00:50:06.291
Thank you.

00:50:06.991 --> 00:50:07.991
This is helpful.

00:50:22.341 --> 00:50:23.811
- Honey. - Yes, thanks.

00:50:27.641 --> 00:50:29.281
Yeong Ra, are you going to the art studio on Saturday?

00:50:29.681 --> 00:50:33.121
Yes. Mom is clearing out the studio,

00:50:33.751 --> 00:50:35.521
so I'm getting all my personal stuff out today.

00:50:36.351 --> 00:50:37.891
Okay, go ahead.

00:50:39.091 --> 00:50:41.161
- I'm heading out. - All right.

00:50:46.901 --> 00:50:49.201
I heard Seong Jae went out to meet a friend, too.

00:50:49.931 --> 00:50:52.001
And he's usually such a homebody, even on his days off.

00:50:53.471 --> 00:50:54.471
Tell me about it.

00:50:57.011 --> 00:50:59.681
So, how about we go for a drive?

00:51:02.211 --> 00:51:04.451
- A drive? - Yes.

00:51:04.881 --> 00:51:06.951
It's been a while since we went on a real date.

00:51:08.021 --> 00:51:09.321
With the new product launch and all.

00:51:10.651 --> 00:51:13.521
Of course, you wouldn't know. You're always playing golf at dawn.

00:51:13.821 --> 00:51:16.331
Downtown will be packed with traffic by now.

00:51:17.661 --> 00:51:19.561
- Oh, no. - What's wrong?

00:51:19.631 --> 00:51:21.971
I had a wedding to go to today. What am I going to do?

00:51:22.701 --> 00:51:24.941
It was for a friend's son from my executive group.

00:51:25.301 --> 00:51:27.101
Honey, I think I'm starting menopause.

00:51:27.401 --> 00:51:28.471
It's really happening.

00:51:30.271 --> 00:51:32.211
I guess it really is menopause, then.

00:51:32.641 --> 00:51:33.881
For someone so meticulous...

00:51:34.211 --> 00:51:36.651
to forget about a wedding she was supposed to attend.

00:51:49.631 --> 00:51:50.631
Hey, Su Bin.

00:51:55.471 --> 00:51:56.571
What the...

00:51:57.571 --> 00:51:59.001
No way. Did she really not recognise me?

00:51:59.641 --> 00:52:01.511
It's 1pm. I wonder if he's running late.

00:52:05.141 --> 00:52:06.911
I'm here. Where are you?

00:52:11.181 --> 00:52:12.651
She really didn't recognise me.

00:52:22.191 --> 00:52:23.731
Let's see how long it takes for her to realise.

00:52:56.491 --> 00:52:58.361
I have a boyfriend, you know.

00:53:01.131 --> 00:53:02.131
What?

00:53:03.001 --> 00:53:04.431
I'm not giving you my number.

00:53:07.471 --> 00:53:08.511
Seong Jae?

00:53:09.911 --> 00:53:12.881
So you have another boyfriend?

00:53:13.581 --> 00:53:17.211
No, it's just some guy kept hovering around me,

00:53:17.451 --> 00:53:19.880
so I thought, "Another guy wants my number."

00:53:19.881 --> 00:53:20.881
"Another guy?"

00:53:21.351 --> 00:53:23.551
Do a lot of guys ask for your number?

00:53:24.321 --> 00:53:25.791
I've had my fair share.

00:53:28.461 --> 00:53:30.890
- Anyway, what's with this outfit? - What?

00:53:30.891 --> 00:53:32.201
I thought you were my age.

00:53:36.031 --> 00:53:37.031
Really?

00:53:37.701 --> 00:53:39.501
This hip style looks great on you.

00:53:40.401 --> 00:53:41.401
You really think so?

00:53:42.211 --> 00:53:43.871

There are 26 parties ahead of us.

00:53:54.021 --> 00:53:55.091
What?

00:53:57.121 --> 00:53:59.221
It's a trendy spot.

00:54:00.391 --> 00:54:03.431
It's cold, isn't it? Let's just go to a hotel restaurant.

00:54:03.661 --> 00:54:06.131
What? You just don't get it, do you?

00:54:06.431 --> 00:54:09.231
Waiting in line like this is all part of the fun of dating.

00:54:10.731 --> 00:54:11.741
Waiting in line?

00:54:12.041 --> 00:54:16.011
Imagine how good the food will taste after waiting in the cold.

00:54:16.141 --> 00:54:17.341
It's a famous spot for a reason.

00:54:17.711 --> 00:54:20.781
Plus, it gives us more time to talk while we wait.

00:54:20.981 --> 00:54:23.251
It's all about making memories.

00:54:23.851 --> 00:54:26.421
Isn't this your first time waiting in line?

00:54:26.851 --> 00:54:28.251
You're having many firsts with me, right?

00:54:30.621 --> 00:54:33.161
You're right. Everything is a first.

00:54:33.921 --> 00:54:35.131
This feeling, too.

00:54:36.291 --> 00:54:39.301
My heart keeps fluttering, and I can't stop smiling.

No way! That is Seong Jae.

00:55:03.691 --> 00:55:05.421
Seong Jae wears stuff like that?

00:55:07.321 --> 00:55:11.231
Yes. He really tries hard for me.

00:55:12.161 --> 00:55:13.961
Gosh, I shouldn't have asked.

00:55:14.661 --> 00:55:16.001
You just love rubbing it in, don't you?

Ta-da! Hey, a gift to celebrate your new studio.

00:55:23.041 --> 00:55:24.071
Ji Wan...

00:55:25.481 --> 00:55:26.611
I'm so touched.

00:55:26.941 --> 00:55:31.081
Every writer's studio needs a plant. You can put it right here.

00:55:34.581 --> 00:55:37.591
What are you staring at? Are you really that touched?

00:55:39.291 --> 00:55:41.121
I bet Woo Jin would be touched too.

Hey, I want to go visit Woo Jin.

00:55:50.901 --> 00:55:53.541
Like you said, I can just wear a disguise, right?

00:55:54.441 --> 00:55:56.511
And there's no way my mom will be in his room all day.

00:55:59.011 --> 00:56:02.181
All right. Besides, we have the gear for it.

00:56:03.051 --> 00:56:04.211
That's a great idea, Yeong Ra.

00:56:04.981 --> 00:56:06.121
Good thinking.

00:56:06.921 --> 00:56:08.551
So these are all their signature dishes.

00:56:09.921 --> 00:56:11.391
This looks good,

00:56:12.621 --> 00:56:14.061
and so does this one.

Here, give me those.

00:58:47.381 --> 00:58:50.851
Hello? I sent you a text a moment ago.

00:58:51.411 --> 00:58:53.551
Tell me exactly what's going on.

00:58:54.381 --> 00:58:57.991
If the taxi exited at Goyang IC, you must've seen the license plate,

00:58:58.191 --> 00:59:00.091
which means you should be able to find the driver, right?

00:59:00.321 --> 00:59:04.931
We found and spoke with the driver. After exiting the Goyang IC,

00:59:05.131 --> 00:59:06.831
he dropped him off in front of an underpass.

00:59:07.131 --> 00:59:11.601
But there's no CCTV there. It looks like he got out on purpose.

00:59:12.041 --> 00:59:15.171
- What do you mean, on purpose? - So you couldn't find him.

00:59:15.671 --> 00:59:17.111
He left a suicide note, didn't he?

You will never see me again in this life.
