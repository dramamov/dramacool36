Ran.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.760
Why do you love tigers?

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:53.440
Zhang Ran.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:56.200
Zhang Ran.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:57.760
What?

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.880
Shh!

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:14.520
If it weren't for drink,

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:15.520
you wouldn't wake up.

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.640
Leave me alone.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.760
Check out

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:19.560
what I took.

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:20.280
What time is it?

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:22.520
Are we almost there?

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:23.240
Look who it is.

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:24.200
Who?

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:25.840
It's my cousin.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:27.200
She's up ahead.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:33.720
Your cousin?

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.920
It fell off?

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.640
See?

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:47.920
So lively and fresh.

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:48.640
Really lively.

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.640
The fresher, the faster.

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.920
No matter how fast,

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.240
it still ends up in the pot.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.720
These crabs are top-notch.

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.560
Just this one's a bit small.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:57.920
I'll get you a bigger one.

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.079
No need, just weigh them.

00:03:59.200 --> 00:03:59.520
Okay.

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.680
It's fine.

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.800
I'll give this one to my husband.

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.080
You're too kind.

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.680
Big ones are for daughter and son-in-law,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.480
smaller ones are for Mr. Zhang.

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:10.600
He doesn't appreciate.

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:11.880
What for?

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:13.000
Besides,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.480
how can he compare to my son-in-law?

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:15.520
My son-in-law

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:16.880
graduated from an "Ivory League".

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.160
He's a chemistry PhD.

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.320
My husband couldn't even

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:21.760
tell left from right.

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.640
Alright.

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:26.400
These crabs

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.280
weigh 4.7 pounds total.

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:29.440
46 yuan per pound.

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.520
For you, I'll round it down.

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:32.800
I'll only charge 200

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.800
instead of 215.

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.560
No, that's too much off.

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:36.680
Wait, hold on.

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:37.120
Ms. Zhou,

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.159
just a moment.

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:39.040
I heard your

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.600
famous daughter

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:41.840
is back in China.

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.080
Is she returning to the TV station?

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:45.680
She hasn't said.

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.760
She doesn't discuss things with me.

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.000
She must be going back.

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:50.040
You see...

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.840
She has been a famous host.

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:52.720
With all her

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:53.720
experience abroad,

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:55.120
the station must have

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:56.200
begged her to return.

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:57.360
Perhaps.

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.840
Of all people

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:00.080
in the sugar factory,

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.680
I just knew

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.320
she was the most talented.

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:03.520
Ms. Zhou,

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.480
do you remember Xiaobo?

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.400
Our own Liu Bo.

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:09.680
Wasn't he a tour guide?

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:10.720
Don't even start.

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:12.320
His agency went bankrupt.

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:13.480
Now he's just

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:14.320
staying at home.

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:15.200
Can't find

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.280
a proper job.

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:17.960
I... I was wondering

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.240
if you could ask

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:22.240
your daughter to talk to the station,

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.840
and get Xiaobo

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:24.520
a job there?

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:26.120
Okay.

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:27.520
I'll mention it when she's back.

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:30.760
Our Ran is very kind-hearted.

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:32.680
Always a model student.

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.320
Her reports always said

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:35.480
she's cooperative

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:36.159
and helpful.

00:05:36.159 --> 00:05:36.640
I'll bet.

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:37.760
I'll talk to her.

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:38.760
Thank you!

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:39.480
How much was it?

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:40.600
No, keep the change.

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:42.120
Just... just 200.

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:43.159
That's robbery!

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:43.640
It's nothing.

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:44.920
Alright, done.

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:46.120
Thank you.

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:47.560
Here, let me carry that.

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:48.440
No, I'm fine.

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:49.720
Really, it's no problem.

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:50.560
I've got it.

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:51.400

Shi, your wheel's vile.

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:15.480
What wine?

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:16.720

Scared of your wife!

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:30.560
Wife-whipped!

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:32.799
Under her thumb!

00:08:32.799 --> 00:08:33.880
Run!

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:44.400
Zhang Jianbin, hurry up!

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:45.520
Peel the ginger

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:46.520

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:52.600
Yudong and Ran

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:53.880
aren't strangers.

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:54.960
They're married.

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:57.200
No need for formalities with family.

00:08:58.040 --> 00:08:58.680
Yudong

00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:00.480
has only visited a few times.

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:02.280
We haven't even met his parents.

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:03.240
No grandchildren yet,

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:04.280
how is that family?

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:05.760
No more excuses, lazybone.

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:07.240
Look sharp!

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:08.280
Okay.

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:09.880
Are you working

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:11.000
or your phone is?

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:13.200
I'm peeling ginger!

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:14.760
Your sister says

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:16.360
fancy bistros nowadays

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:17.880
peel their ginger properly.

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:19.960
But for family meals?

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:20.880
I see no need.

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:22.320
Your sister's too fussy.

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:23.760
Just do what she asked

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:25.280
and stop whining.

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:28.640
You're definitely her sister.

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:30.840
What can I help with?

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:32.280
Any operation

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:33.320
to perform, surgeon?

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:34.040
Step aside.

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:35.840
I've just washed my hands!

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:37.000
Fine, fine.

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:38.280
No tasks for me?

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:40.240
What?

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:41.560
Not needed yet.

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:43.000
Whatever.

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:44.480
Tonight...

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:47.880
Call Lu Ming,

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:49.200
see if he's picked them up.

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:50.920
No need to call.

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:52.960
He'll bring them back when he's done.

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:55.880
Why not take off

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:56.760
your jacket?

00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:57.520
It's warm.

00:09:57.520 --> 00:09:58.320
I'm fine.

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:00.240
Here, let me.

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:01.080
It is really warm.

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:04.400
Uncle, a bigshot like you

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:05.480
picking us up yourself?

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:06.760
What an honor.

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:08.560
Thank you.

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:10.200
My pleasure.

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:14.360
Parked inside.

00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:15.200
Good.

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:16.920
Haven't been back in ten years.

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:18.280
I don't recognize anything.

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:22.160
Your trunk fits a lot.

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:22.840
Will it all fit?

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:23.440
Yes, yes.

00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:24.200
Here.

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:26.200
Too many suitcases. One more there.

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:27.240
That one should go

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:28.360
in the back seat.

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:29.000
Okay.

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:29.920
Back seat it is.

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:30.880
I'll sit up front then.

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:31.400
Fine.

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:35.440
Uncle, you're so thoughtful.

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:36.560
Cleared the back in advance

00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:38.320
for the luggage.

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:39.920
You even folded the front seat.

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:40.680
No problem.

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:41.800
Just adjust it.

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:43.840
Is the cart okay here?

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:45.080
Someone will collect it.

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:45.920
Okay.

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:47.400
A bit cramped.

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:48.320
It's fine.

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:50.720
Better now.

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:51.640
This works.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:52.760
Let's go home.

00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:54.960
How long to get home?

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:55.520
Uncle?

00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:58.280
About half an hour.

00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:03.280
Let's go.

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:09.920
Enough space there?

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:10.400
Plenty.

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:11.240
Very spacious.

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:20.360
Turn up the AC, it's hot.

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:25.360
Here's a tissue.

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:27.080
I'm fine.

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:27.720
Really.

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:28.680
It's okay.

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:39.080
Was this bridge here before?

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:40.920
Built after you left.

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:41.600
Right.

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:42.400
These past years,

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:43.480
the city changed a lot.

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:44.920
Yes, really

00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:45.840
changed a lot.

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:48.520
Yudong, are you local?

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:49.480
No.

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:51.080
I went to university here.

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:54.000
What a coincidence

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:55.280
for you to meet abroad!

00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:55.760
Yes.

00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:57.880
Are your parents

00:11:57.920 --> 00:11:59.360
in your hometown or here?

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:01.960
He's in Lucheng City.

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:04.080
That overpass!

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:04.960
If I recall,

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.080
my first reporting spot

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:06.720
was right there,

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:07.720
near that bridge.

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:08.400
That bridge?

00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:09.840
During the typhoon, right?

00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:10.440
Yes.

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:11.760
Your aunt saw it.

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:12.720
She was worried sick.

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:14.880
Said Xinying should

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:15.880
learn from you.

00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:16.720
That dedication!

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:20.280
Is Xinying doing well?

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:21.520
Yes.

00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:25.760
I didn't tell her

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:27.000
I was coming back.

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:28.960
Is she planning to return?

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:30.520
Probably not.

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:31.840
She's working

00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:32.920
at a bank now.

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:33.560
And

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:35.280
she just got her work permit

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:36.000
renewed.

00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:37.520
Probably can't take time off.

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:41.200
How about you two?

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:42.840
How long are you staying this time?

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:44.720
We're... Actually,

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:45.760
a company here

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:46.600
wants to work with me,

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:48.360
so I come back to

00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:49.080
do some research.

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:49.720
You never know...

00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:51.720
Go ahead, answer it.

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:52.480
It's alright.

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:54.400
Nah, probably a crank call.

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:55.080
Ignore it.

00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:57.680
We'll see what they offer.

00:12:57.680 --> 00:12:58.720
So I come back.

00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:00.760
And Yudong's free right now,

00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:01.920
so he comes with me.

00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:03.160
We'll see how it goes...

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:05.160
Just answer it.

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:08.800
Who is it?

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:10.720
Hello?

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:11.800
Mr. Lu?

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:13.400
Why did you hang up?

00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:15.440
Sorry, who's this?

00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:17.000
I was your passenger

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.680
from OCT to the airport.

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:19.880
Can you check if I

00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:20.960
left my makeup bag

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:22.200
in your car?

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:23.440
A pink one.

00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:25.600
Yes, it's here.

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:27.040
There is one.

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:27.520
Yes.

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:28.640
Can you check

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:29.920
if my ID's inside?

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:30.920
Yes, it's in here.

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:31.600
It's here.

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:33.120
Good.

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:34.080
Could you

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:34.920
bring it to the airport

00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:35.520
right now?

00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:36.440
Thanks.

00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:38.920
Sorry, but

00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:40.080
I've already left.

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:41.120
How about this,

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:42.520
you get a temporary ID first,

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:43.720
and I'll mail it

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:44.760
to you later?

00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:46.160
Listen,

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:47.520
I'm really in a hurry.

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:48.880
I'll pay you 200 yuan extra

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:50.480
to bring it to me.

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:52.080
It's not about the money.

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:52.720
I'm really

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:53.680
busy right now.

00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:54.520
Sorry.

00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:56.000
Don't be sorry!

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.520
Everything's about money.

00:13:57.840 --> 00:13:59.200
What could you possibly be doing?

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:00.400
I booked a premium car.

00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:01.960
I paid for premium service!

00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:02.520
We're fine.

00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:03.520
Is this your attitude?

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:04.400
We can take a detour.

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:04.920
I'm gonna

00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:06.320
report you to the platform!

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:07.400
And my ID...

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:08.120
It's totally fine.

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:09.240
We're not in a hurry.

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:10.120
I don't use temporary one.

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:12.200
Alright, wait a moment.

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:13.080
I can't wait!

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:13.880
Hurry up.

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:15.320
Departures, Gate 9.

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:16.120
Be quick!

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:20.080
It's okay.

00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:21.120
I'll just tell Mom

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:22.440
I forgot something at the airport.

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:23.520
Let's turn around.

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:27.240
Sorry, Yudong.

00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:28.200
No problem.

00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:31.120
Can we turn around

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:31.800
at that bridge?

00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:33.520
Yes, next exit.

00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:34.800
There's an exit here, yeah?

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:56.760
Just picked them up.

Will be here a bit later.

Are they infants?

How can they still be so forgetful?

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:04.080

Zhang Jianbin?

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:11.080
Didn't you ask him

00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:12.480

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:22.640

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:45.480

Well,

00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:44.280
I'm starting my own business,

00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:45.920
so I need to understand

00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:47.080
young people's perspectives.

00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:49.520
Stay current.

00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:50.520
Really?

00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:51.600
Yes, so...

00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:52.760
I occasionally drive

00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:53.680
for ride-sharing

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:55.600
in my free time.

00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:56.160
I see.

00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:57.720
It helps me connect

00:16:57.720 --> 00:16:59.080
with younger people.

00:16:59.080 --> 00:16:59.920
Exactly.

00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:01.200
Many people do this abroad.

00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:02.600
Yudong and I even took

00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:03.640
those high-end,

00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:05.079

00:17:05.079 --> 00:17:05.800
Right, Yudong?

00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:06.480
Yes.

00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:07.920
When Ran went shopping,

00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:09.319
she'd wait in long lines.

00:17:09.319 --> 00:17:10.400
To pass time,

00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:11.319
I'd drive for Uber

00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:12.720
nearby

00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:13.359

00:17:13.599 --> 00:17:14.079

Yes, exactly.

00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:19.079
But about this,

00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:21.119
don't tell your aunt

00:17:21.119 --> 00:17:22.079
or your parents.

00:17:22.079 --> 00:17:23.599
I'm not an idiot, uncle.

00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:24.839
Don't want them to worry.

00:17:24.839 --> 00:17:25.440
I get it.

00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:26.400
Don't worry, uncle.

00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:27.119
Mum's the word.

00:17:27.119 --> 00:17:28.040
I know nothing.

You're

00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:43.840
a bit stouter than on video.

00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:44.600
Same as always.

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:45.280
Let's go home.

00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:45.880

00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:46.480
No, no.

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:47.280
We've got it.

00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:47.840
Don't worry about it.

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:48.240
We're fine.

00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:48.960
Help him.

00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:50.360
Help him, I'll take this.

00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:51.400
It's not heavy, I can...

00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:52.280
Give it to me.

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:52.720
Too much stuff.

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:53.320
Really, it's fine.

00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:54.200
Just pull that.

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:55.080
Help him.

00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:55.880
Let's go.

00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:56.400
Give me one!

00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:57.320
Go ahead.

00:17:57.760 --> 00:17:58.320
My clothes!

00:17:58.320 --> 00:17:58.880
See?

00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:00.600
You pull it, Dad.!

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:01.480
I've got it my way.

00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:02.840
Give me that one.

00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:03.600
No need.

00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:05.080
You'll break it.

00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:06.160
What did you buy?

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:07.360
Nothing, let's go.

00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:08.360
Go ahead, it's fine.

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:10.160
Mom's home, right?

00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:11.280
Yes, turn left here.

00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:12.000
Turn left!

00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:12.560
Left.

00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:13.680
Almost there.

00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:14.520

Here, give me one.

00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:17.360
My hands are free.

00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:20.960
Take them one by one.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:21.840
Lu Ming.

00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:23.360
Let's have a drink

00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:24.280
later.

00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:24.800
Sure.

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:26.520
Dad!

00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:27.720
Give it to me!

00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:28.600
Help your uncle.

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:29.080
I'm fine.

00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:29.520
Uncle!

00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:30.120
Don't...

00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:30.880
Let go!

00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:31.640
I've got it!

00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:32.400
Give it to him!

00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:32.920
Okay.

00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:33.440
Careful!

00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:34.000
Okay.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:35.520

00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:36.800
What's in here?

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:37.920
It's so heavy!

00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:39.240
Leave it, I'll get it.

00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:39.920
Be right there.

00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:42.520
Here.

00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:46.600
Easy, watch your back!

00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:47.800
Careful!

00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:03.480
What?

00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:05.440
Why measure so precisely?

00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:06.360
It's not medicine.

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:07.320
A little more or less

00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:08.400
doesn't matter.

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:09.920
Stop hovering

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:11.400
and nagging!

00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:12.200
Just

00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:13.320
pour it evenly.

00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:14.880
Swirl it around.

00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:15.680
My way

00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:17.000
spreads it evenly.

00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:18.680
Mine works too.

00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:19.640
And you're

00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:22.800
taking forever!

00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:24.160
Have some grapes, aunt.

00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:25.600
Grapes, mom.

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:26.560
You're taking forever.

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:29.320
I'm just asking!

00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:30.400
Am I stopping you from eating?

00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:31.680
Need help? No?

00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:32.800
Fine.

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:34.520
Dad, uncle,

00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:35.360
what are you watching?

00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:37.560
A business show.

00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:39.560
Used to be your show.

00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:40.680
Not good anymore.

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:41.560
Not without me.

00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:42.160
Her face

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:43.320
looks weird, see?

00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:44.680
You're cruel, kiddo.

00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:46.840
Yudong?

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:48.760
Let's unpack.

00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:51.160
We're at her place now, getting

00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:51.920
ready for meal.

00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:53.040
Maybe in a few days.

00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:53.960
Let's see then

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:55.120
if we can set up a meeting.

00:19:59.320 --> 00:19:59.840
What?

00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:01.480
Let's unpack.

00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:02.440
You're not even halfway...

00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:03.520
Why are you standing there?

00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:04.880
It's fine.

00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:06.600
Her uncle picked us up.

00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:07.760
We're at her place now,

00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:08.640
getting ready for dinner.

00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:09.680
Maybe in a few days.

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:10.600
Let's see then if we can

00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:11.760
set up a meeting.

00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:14.800
Don't wait!

00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:16.680
No time like the present.

00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:17.640
Tomorrow!

00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:19.680
Perfect timing,

00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:20.880
Cheng Man's home too.

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:21.560
Come for lunch

00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:23.480
with Ran,

00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:25.480
bring some gifts

00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:27.520
to my place,

00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:29.320
and visit me.

00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:31.440
I've got some

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:32.320
great news!

00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:35.680
Okay, then tomorrow it is.

00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:38.520
You brought this pot back?

00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:39.640
When did you get this?

00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:40.880
No wonder the suitcase was so heavy!

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:41.720
Oh, right. Mom!

00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:43.320
Mom!

00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:46.520
The pot you wanted.

00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:47.320
What pot?

00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:47.960
I went with Zhang Ran

00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:48.840
and bought it for you.

00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:49.520
She paid with her card.

00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:51.080
This pot is seriously heavy.

00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:52.160
Ran raid for this?

00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:54.160
Give it to me.

00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:55.880
Customs never lets me bring it.

00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:56.960
Says it's over the weight limit.

00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:58.040
Let me wash it.

00:20:58.120 --> 00:20:58.680
I'll make you

00:20:58.720 --> 00:20:59.400
red-braised pork later.

00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:00.720
You're so thoughtful!

00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:02.000
So observant!

00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:03.520
I'll do it.

00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:04.560
Let me do it.

00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:06.040
[Ailing, look at this pot.]

00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:06.760
[It's just like yours.]

00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:08.000
Fu Yudong, where's

00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:08.960
that American ginseng?

00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:10.160
[Coming.]

00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:12.160
[Is it the same as yours?]

00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:12.840
What?

00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:14.320
[You just like my pot.]

00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:15.560
Look over there.

00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:17.040
[It's great for cooking, right?]

00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:17.920
[But it's not]

00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:19.000
[the same brand as ours.]

00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:19.960
Count them.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:20.840
Am I great?

00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:22.960
One, two, three, four...

00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:24.960
Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:27.000
Not bad.

00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:28.320
So many certificates.

00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:30.280
I get that many in one semester.

00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:32.280
You can go now.

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:32.840
You're done here.

00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:33.720
I don't need you anymore.

00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:34.240
I mean it.

00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:34.920
Get going.

00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:36.160
But I think you've already

00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:36.680
done really well.

00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:37.480
Get out of here.

00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:38.400
"Best Debater."

00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:39.440
"Best Writer."

00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:40.520
"Best..."

00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:41.800
[Why have you been best debater so many times?]

00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:45.000
[Mom, let me do it.]

00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:45.680
[This pot doesn't need]

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:47.240
[to be seasoned, right?]

00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:48.080
[Needed.]

00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:48.920
[Definitely needed.]

00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:49.760
[For real?]

00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:50.480
[Of course.]

00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:51.920
Imported ones still need seasoning?

00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:52.480
[Yes.]

00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:53.560
[It's a clay pot?]

00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:55.200
Not a clay pot.

00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:55.880
This exact one.

00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:57.200
Just like Ailing has.

00:21:57.520 --> 00:21:58.760
Ours doesn't need seasoning.

00:21:58.760 --> 00:21:59.280
Silly tiger.

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:01.520
Clay pots need seasoning.

00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:03.000
This one doesn't.

00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:03.880
This one...

00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:06.680
Ailing said meat cooked in this is so delicious.

00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:13.520
Pierce likes

00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:15.640
this hairstyle.

00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:17.200
In front of Pierce,

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:18.080
can I have this hairstyle?

00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:19.120
Looks like a silly girl.

00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:20.920
I'd definitely need full makeup.

00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:22.280
At least you know you're silly.

00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:24.200
You ungrateful brat...

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:26.840
You just leave me like this.

00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:29.280
Such a big TV station,

00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:30.960
how can't they keep you?

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:33.240
I just told you the day before yesterday.

00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:34.080
I can't say it

00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:35.280
every single day.

00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:36.640
I don't like

00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:37.680
the competitive environment.

00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:38.360
Besides,

00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:40.040
in this new era, you need long-term vision.

00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:41.160
You've got to fight tooth and nail

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:42.560
just to grab some scraps.

00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:43.640
What's the point?

00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:46.160
Just because you don't like it and you're leaving me.

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:47.960
That's called a job for life.

00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:49.520
I don't know about that.

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:50.880
Pierce said

00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:52.080
in the era of globalization

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:53.920
what matters is global influence.

00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:55.800
Someone like me who speaks English

00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:57.160
and is good at communicating

00:22:57.240 --> 00:22:58.920
would definitely thrive in Canada.

00:22:58.920 --> 00:22:59.720
Who knows,

00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:00.480
maybe I'll become

00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:01.920
an internationally influential host.

00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:03.320
I'll bring honor to the family.

00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:06.120
It's not that simple.

00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:08.000
Let me try first.

00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:08.840
Worst case scenario,

00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:09.840
even if I don't succeed,

00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:10.440
can't I just

00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:11.320
be a housewife at home?

00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:13.080
Pierce has it all there,

00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:14.160
place, wheels, status.

00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:15.480
Most importantly, he's handsome.

00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:17.280
Like that matters.

00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:19.080
He has no manners.

00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:21.200
If you marry a Chinese guy,

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:21.840
he'll be

00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:23.080
over at our place all the time.

00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:24.520
He's Western.

00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:25.560
He doesn't care about that.

00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:27.800
Who cares?

00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:29.760
The problem is the distance.

00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:32.240
What if something happens?

00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:33.720
Your family won't be there for you.

00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:35.280
What if he bullies you?

00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:37.840
It won't happen and there're laws.

00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:38.640
Who could

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:40.080
possibly bully me?

00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:42.440
You don't want

00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:43.320
these cases anymore?

00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:44.080
That one...

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:46.080
Such an expensive bag,

00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:48.040
how could you just stuff it in there?

00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:49.000
If you don't mind it,

00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:50.480
take it out and use it.

00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:51.400
I'll buy you a new one

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:52.040
and a good one.

00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:53.360
Don't waste money.

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:54.280
You must be crazy.

00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:55.080
These cases...

00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:56.600
Don't put it that high.

00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:57.640
Just stack them here.

00:23:57.640 --> 00:23:58.880
Okay, put them there.

00:23:58.920 --> 00:23:59.960
Stop nagging me.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.080
I still need

00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:03.040
to unpack the cabinet.

00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:05.240
I'll take this one.

00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:06.760
I'll take this one.

00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:08.840
Can you bring something useful?

00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:10.400
Don't be so childish.

00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:11.920
When are you gonna grow up?

00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:23.200
Hello, I'm Zhang Ran.

00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:25.080
I just got my degree in English

00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:25.960
from Lucheng University this year.

00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:28.520
Before that, at the campus job fair,

00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:30.480
I signed an agreement with you.

00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:32.200
I'm here

00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:34.320
to report for duty.

00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:51.880
Hi, Miss Lin,

00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:53.000
I'm Zhang Ran,

00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:54.080
a graduate in English

00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:55.080
from Lucheng University.

00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:56.720
Now working in the News Editing Room

00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:58.280
on international news compilation.

00:24:58.400 --> 00:24:59.600
Just came to say hello.

00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:01.560
Good position and great talent.

00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:03.560
[I'm off early today. Any fun plans?]

00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:04.760
[Why'd you step on my shoe?]

00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:06.880
Today...

00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:09.000
I think today is Ting's birthday.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:10.000
Let's go inside.

00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:11.880
Who is that?

00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:14.360
The famous host, Miss Lin.

00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:16.160
What a coincidence.

00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:18.120
[I was just talking about you]

00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:19.040
[with these young girls.]

00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:21.160
Look at Wang.

00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:22.720
Take a good look.

00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:24.960
Familiar, right?

00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:27.480
Isn't she just like you

00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:28.520
when you first joined the station?

00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:32.000
Just like the next Lin Fei.

00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:33.520
What a coincidence.

00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:35.280
I was just talking about Zhang Ran too.

00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:37.520
She's on international news compilation.

00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:38.640
That's where

00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:40.440
two deputy directors came from.

00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:42.760
When I first started hosting,

00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:44.440
Mr. Zhou were doing that job.

00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:47.280
Mr. Zhou, you're amazing.

00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:48.120
Fei,

00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:50.240
I've always heard from Mr. Zhou.

00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:52.840
You've moved to an office job.

00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:55.000
Why come back to the front lines?

00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:55.800
You think being

00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:57.320
a reporter is easy?

00:25:58.280 --> 00:25:59.160
I joined the TV station

00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:00.440
because I wanted to be a host.

00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:02.200
I have Level A Mandarin certification.

00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:03.480
I even got my host qualification certificate.

00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:04.440
I can do it.

00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:05.440
I think...

00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:06.320
[Mr. Zhou,]

00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:08.600
Since Ran brought it up,

00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:09.600
let her have a shot.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:10.440
Aren't we supposed

00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:11.840
to give youngsters a chance?

00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:14.480
[Did you schedule it?]

00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:15.360
[No.]

00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:16.920
[Don't worry. I'll help you set it up later.]

00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:17.360
Okay.

00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:19.040
Zhang Ran,

00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:21.640
reporting is really tough.

00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:23.080
Early mornings, late nights,

00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:24.400
out in wind and rain,

00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:26.800
barely eating, drinking, or sleeping well.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:28.720
Can you handle it?

00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:30.240
I can.

00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:32.880
Hello everyone, I'm Zhang Ran.

00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:34.960
I'm now at the coastal park.

00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:36.360
We're currently about

00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:37.720
100 kilometers from

00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:39.520
the typhoon's center.

00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:41.360
[Just now on our way here,]

00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:42.480
[we saw many]

00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:43.360
[shop signs]

00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:44.640
[already blown down.]

00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:46.680
[Already blown...]

00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:48.760
Everyone,

00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:51.000
stay home

00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:52.960
unless you really have to go out...

00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:54.440
Some people say

00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:55.320
you're working so hard

00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:56.120
just to

00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:57.720
become a financial news host.

00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:00.280
If I were you, I wouldn't even care.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:01.480
Having ambition

00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:02.800
isn't a bad thing at all.

00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:06.200
New bag?

00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:06.960
Yeah.

00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:08.840
Saved up for a long time to buy it.

00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:10.080
It really suits you.

00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:12.040
I'm heading out now.

00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:12.800
Okay, bye.

00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:13.400
Bye.

00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:21.120
We are really sorry about

00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:21.400
this

00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:22.120
technical issue.

00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:23.280
Our team is all set.

00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:24.120
We're gonna fix it

00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:24.880
in about 10 to 15 seconds.

00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:26.480
We sincerely thank you for your patience.

00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:27.800
[Speak louder. I can't hear you.]

00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:30.080
Threatened miscarriage?

00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:33.200
Excuse me, I'll be back soon.

00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:34.400
That's what the doctor said?

00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:36.320
Alright then.

00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:37.240
You stay there

00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:38.240
and focus on preserving the pregnancy.

00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:38.920
Mr. Zhou.

00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:40.880
We're about

00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:42.560
to record the show

00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:44.200
and Lin Fei went to hospital.

00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:47.160
What if there's dead air?

00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:11.520
I'll do it.

00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:12.400
You?

00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:13.920
Let me take the slot.

00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:15.640
I'm ready.

00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:18.520
[Life always seems to]

00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:19.880
[have other plans.]

00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:22.160
[I thought I would be an interpreter,]

00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:24.200
[but now I'm an anchor instead.]

00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:25.320
[This reminds me of]

00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:26.240
[my favorite line:]

00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:28.960
[Life is like a box of chocolate,]

00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:30.200
[you never know]

00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:31.280
[what you gonna get.]

00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:33.760
Honey,

00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:35.280
do you think this style works for me?

00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:37.600
She has over a million followers.

00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:38.560
I'm not even close to her?

00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:41.600
This looks great.

00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:42.080
Right?

00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:43.360
You're way better than her.

00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:44.440
Exactly.

00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:49.080
You'll have to work a bit tomorrow though.

00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:51.400
We're going to Li Daoqi's for meal.

00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:52.560
That person

00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:53.480
I told you about before.

00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:54.280
Okay.

00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:55.440
What time tomorrow?

00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:56.120
Tomorrow afternoon,

00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:57.320
I have to go to that company.

00:28:57.720 --> 00:28:58.520
Okay, then noon.

00:28:59.120 --> 00:28:59.720
Noon works.

00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:00.600
It's Li Daoqi

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:01.800
and his wife Cheng Man.

00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:03.400
Okay, let's go early.

00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:05.800
Is dad going tomorrow?

00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:08.440
Is 11:00 AM okay?

00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:09.520
Sure.

00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:10.160
[Ran,]

00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:12.320
[I want to get you]

00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:13.520
[a thin silk quilt.]

00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:15.080
Come on, mom.

00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:16.000
[I'm heading in.]

00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:16.680
Okay.

00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:19.160
I told your dad to grab a quilt,

00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:20.240
and he brought such a thick one.

00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:21.320
Watch out, mom.

00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:22.080
Thank you, mom.

00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:23.000
Here, this one's for you.

00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:24.200
Hi, dad.

00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:27.200
Why the winking? What's up?

00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:28.280
I'm looking for Fu.

00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:29.480
We're gonna chat.

00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:30.120
Not with you.

00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:31.240
It's already late.

00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:32.440
We've been on a plane all day.

00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:32.920
We're exhausted.

00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:33.920
Let's talk tomorrow. Still getting over the jet lag.

00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:35.760
It's okay if dad wants to talk.

00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:37.920
You stay out of it.

00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:39.720
Jet lag is killing us.

00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:40.640
Come on.

00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:42.120
It's fine. I'll take it.

00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:42.840
Come on.

00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:44.080
Dad's...

00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:50.840
Such a goofball.

00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:51.600
What?

00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:53.920
Your dad cares about you.

00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:55.800
What are you doing?

00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:57.280
Just like you're interrogating a spy?

00:29:57.880 --> 00:29:58.800
Be serious.

00:29:59.120 --> 00:29:59.960
I'm being very serious.

00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:01.200
This one is thin.

00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:03.040
Once when I was organizing things,

00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:04.640
I found a business card

00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:05.880
from that guy

00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:07.080
you used to date,

00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:08.160
Pierce.

00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:10.200
His name's initials

00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:12.080
are PZ.

00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:13.640
What does PZ stand for

00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:14.200
in Chinese?

00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:16.080
Cheater!

00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:19.080
You're still laughing?

00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:21.080
You really can make connections.

00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:22.480
That chapter's closed. Let's not bring it up.

00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:23.640
What do you mean closed?

00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:25.520
Shouldn't we learn from it?

00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:27.720
Your dad and I have been reflecting

00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:29.280
on your first failed relationship.

00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:30.120
That was our responsibility.

00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:30.920
We didn't vet him properly.

00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:32.480
You can do it now.

00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:33.760
You've already called him out.

00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:34.880
- I didn't say anything.
- Keep it down.

00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:35.720
I didn't stop you.

00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:38.120
Look at you and Ran.

00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:39.720
You've been married for years now,

00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:41.480
and...

00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:44.120
I don't really know you yet.

00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:45.080
We've never

00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:46.400
really

00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:47.160
had a proper chat.

00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:49.480
You don't really know me either.

00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:50.960
Now that you're back this time,

00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:52.040
it's the perfect opportunity

00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:53.360
for us to have a good talk.

00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:55.800
Dad, if there's anything

00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:56.720
you want to know about me,

00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:57.680
feel free to ask.

00:30:57.840 --> 00:30:59.320
I'll answer honestly.

00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:01.400
Fu

00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:03.040
seems pretty honest and reliable.

00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:04.720
Looks like a decent guy.

00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:05.120
He's not bad.

00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:05.720
Alright then.

00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:07.800
But your aunt warned me:

00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:09.920
when people

00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:10.800
come back from abroad,

00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:12.200
everything here in China

00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:13.320
seems

00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:14.520
tempting to them.

00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:15.960
So your dad

00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:17.840
wants to have a word with him.

00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:19.640
Just a reminder.

00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:20.760
See,

00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:22.320
you've been in Canada

00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:23.720
for so many years,

00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:25.280
and you're a PhD,

00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:27.720
educated from a top university.

00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:29.520
You must have

00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:32.520
a global perspective,

00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:33.840
right?

00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:35.480
No, you're too kind.

00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:36.480
I just studied abroad

00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:37.920
for a few years.

00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:40.360
You're too modest.

00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:41.680
I'd like

00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:44.720
to discuss something with you.

00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:45.720
Go ahead.

00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:48.320
How about

00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:49.520
we talk about oil?

00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:54.080
Oil.

00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:56.560
I mean the kind used as fuel.

00:31:57.320 --> 00:31:59.080
[It's getting warm globally.]

00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:01.080
Oil?

00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:02.360
[It's getting worse.]

00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:05.080
[So I think we should]

00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:06.920
[talk about how to]

00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:08.840
[save these non-renewable resources.]

00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:10.760
[Oil]

00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:11.960
[is a kind of...]

00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:14.400
How are you so off-topic?

00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:16.280
Why are you talking about oil?

00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:18.200
Leave it to the UN.

00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:19.680
Just go to sleep first.

00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:20.280
Okay, dad?

00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:21.880
We're dealing with jet lag here.

00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:23.280
I don't really know

00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:24.440
the situation over there.

00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:25.040
Oh.

00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:27.000
[Hurry up, Fu Yudong.]

00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:27.960
[Come back and sleep.]

00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:28.720
Okay, okay.

00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:29.480
Go sleep.

00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:30.720
You go to sleep first.

00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:32.080
Fu,

00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:34.360
tomorrow we'll continue.

00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:35.720
Sure.

00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:36.960
Let's sleep.

00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:38.480
You all rest early then.

00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:44.280
Mentioned anything important?

00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:45.240
What important stuff?

00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:49.440
Dad's so adorable.

00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:50.480
The biggest regret

00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:51.000
of my dad's life

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:52.200
is that he never got to work with oil.

00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:53.720
I can't believe him.

00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:56.720
Time to sleep.

00:32:56.720 --> 00:32:57.840
Where's my phone? Need to charge it.

00:32:57.840 --> 00:32:58.360
Here.

00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:00.760
This quilt's perfect,

00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:02.240
just the right thickness.

00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:03.720
That other one was way too thick.

00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:06.440
Charger.

00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:07.600
I'll dig it out of the suitcase.

00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:08.280
I'll get it.

00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:09.240
In the small one.

00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:10.280
The small carry-on.

00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:11.120
In the small one.

00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:11.880
Yeah, here it is.

00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:13.920
Right side?

00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:14.920
Yes, that's it.

00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:15.520
Type-C connector.

00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:20.920
Welcome to my home!

00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:23.080
Glad to be here!

00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:26.080
When your mom came in earlier,

00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:26.840
she scared me.

00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:28.480
Scared of what?

00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:29.400
You didn't even warn me.

00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:30.680
I was wearing big shorts.

00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:32.040
What's wrong with that?

00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:33.400
First time at your house,

00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:34.280
and I'm in big shorts.

00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:35.360
You weren't wearing underwear.

00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:35.960
What's the big deal?

00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:36.840
What's so impolite about it?

00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:37.760
From now on, you'll have to

00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:38.880
wear big shorts at home every day.

00:33:40.840 --> 00:33:41.720
Tomorrow I'll wear them with you.

00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:42.680
I'll wear big shorts too.

00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:51.720
Let's go.

00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:55.920
Let's go.

00:33:57.520 --> 00:33:58.840
This isn't good. Stop.

00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:00.080
Fu Yudong, you're something else.

00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:03.320
Every day the most you say

00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:04.200
is "stop".

00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:06.760
Stop.

00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:12.480
Honey...

00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:15.000
Zhang Ran...

00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:17.360
Look.

00:34:21.639 --> 00:34:22.480
What are those two doing?

00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:23.920
Personal shopper.

00:34:25.159 --> 00:34:25.719
How could

00:34:25.719 --> 00:34:27.320
he possibly be a PhD?

00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:28.360
What executive?

00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:29.679
He doesn't look like one at all.

00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:31.920
Oh my...

00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:33.480
I'll call your eldest sister.

00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:35.400
Don't call.

00:34:35.719 --> 00:34:36.840
What if they don't know?

00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:38.159
That would be so awkward.

00:34:38.639 --> 00:34:39.920
Wait, does my sister know

00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:41.480
her daughter is a personal shopper?

00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:43.159
If she does, calling her would be awkward.

00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:48.760
So, we just pretend we don't know?

00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:51.960
Why are you so happy about this?

00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:53.719
Oh my...

00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:57.120
Oh, Ran.

00:34:58.200 --> 00:34:59.280
That's too much!

00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:00.640
This is too ridiculous.

00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:05.040
It's not here.

00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:06.400
These are all just blankets.

00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:07.360
Mom.

00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:08.560
Mom.

00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:09.480
[What's wrong?]

00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:10.560
It's not here either.

00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:11.800
Where's the bag?

00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:13.320
[Didn't I tell you?]

00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:15.080
[It's in the middle compartment up top.]

00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:16.920
This compartment is all blankets.

00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:20.080
[How did it end up with the blankets?]

00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:20.720
[How did it get...]

00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:21.800
There's nothing back here either.

00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:22.640
It's all empty.

00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:23.400
Honey,

00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:24.920
is this the middle?

00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:25.880
There's one over here.

00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:26.840
Is this the middle?

00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:28.160
What's this?

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:29.360
Isn't this...

00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:30.680
You're amazing.

00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:32.920
That's the middle left compartment.

00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:34.520
In the red one over there.

00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:36.760
Which red one?

00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:37.920
This one?

00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:39.400
Yes. Right there.

00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:41.400
I thought you gave it away.

00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:43.160
No one wanted that.

00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:45.240
It is so useless.

00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:46.800
It's heavy itself,

00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:48.280
can't hold much anyway.

00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:49.840
With this much stuff

00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:51.000
in the cabinet,

00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:52.080
how can you find anything?

00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:12.880
Great. Thank you.

00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:13.640
You're welcome.

00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:14.640
[She's about to give birth soon, right?]

00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:15.440
[For this child,]

00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:16.720
[she's given up quite a lot.]

00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:17.400
[Yes.]

00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:18.160
[Exactly.]

00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:20.080
That's impressive.

00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:20.560
Come on.

00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:21.600
Mr. Chen, want more?

00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:23.360
Good.

00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:25.000
Look at Zhang,

00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:25.960
she did great.

00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:26.520
Right.

00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:27.560
Calm under pressure.

00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:28.520
[I think]

00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:29.840
[with proper training,]

00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:30.480
[in the future,]

00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:31.840
[she won't be any worse than Lin Fei.]

00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:32.720
[Mr. Chen,]

00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:34.440
[you can't praise young people to their face.]

00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:37.160
They need more training

00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:37.760
and experience now.

00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:39.960
Give them space to showcase,

00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:40.840
and in the future

00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:42.960
they won't bring shame to our station.

00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:44.680
Right?

00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:45.920
That makes sense.

00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:51.200
Full again.

00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:52.520
Mr. Chen,

00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:54.000
let me toast you.

00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:54.520
Good.

00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:55.520
Thank you for your

00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:56.680
continued guidance and support.

00:36:56.760 --> 00:36:58.120
I'll work twice as hard

00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:00.960
to repay your support.

00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:01.560
Thank you.

00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:02.080
Excellent, excellent.

00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:02.960
Thank you.

00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:03.720
I'll drink with you.

00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:04.160
Thank you.

00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:04.960
Mr. Zhou's worked hard too.

00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:09.400
You're looking better and better.

00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:10.600
Mr. Chen,

00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:13.120
did you see

00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:14.120
the program innovation proposal

00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:14.880
I sent you last time?

00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:15.640
If there's anything not good about it,

00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:16.200
just tell me,

00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:17.320
I'll revise it right away.

00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:19.160
Zhang,

00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:20.920
you just became a host,

00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:22.160
don't be

00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:23.080
too ambitious.

00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:24.560
Alright, alright...

00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:27.280
I mainly think that

00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:28.320
finance programs

00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:29.080
sometimes

00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:30.200
have too much homogenization.

00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:31.920
If we innovate a bit,

00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:33.600
it might feel fresh

00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:34.600
to some viewers

00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:35.400
and

00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:36.320
possibly attract new audiences too.

00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:38.960
Proposals are just words on paper.

00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:39.960
People are what matter.

00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:41.240
Zhang,

00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:42.680
why don't you elaborate

00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:43.280
on your ideas?

00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:44.200
Sure.

00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:46.760
No.

00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:48.320
We agreed today

00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:49.160
we're drinking

00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:50.480
to relax, right?

00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:52.240
If you start elaborating,

00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:53.960
won't that put pressure on the leadership?

00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:54.560
Right.

00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:55.320
No elaborating.

00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:56.320
No elaborating.

00:37:56.320 --> 00:37:56.800
I'll drink a penalty.

00:37:57.240 --> 00:37:57.920
My bad.

00:37:58.680 --> 00:37:59.320
Come on.

00:37:59.320 --> 00:37:59.760
Right.

00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:00.720
I didn't expect...

00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:01.440
Actually just now,

00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:02.480
I had no intention of overstepping.

00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:03.840
For my proposal...

00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:05.800
Since I'm still a newbie,

00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:07.560
I really hope you can

00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:09.000
give me more feedback.

00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:10.440
That way I can improve it

00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:11.800
and make our program

00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:12.800
even better,

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:14.680
more appealing to young audiences.

00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:17.680
Actually, I think

00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:19.160
other programs

00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:20.000
could

00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:21.800
apply

00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:23.240
your new proposal.

00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:23.760
Right?

00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:25.240
Right?

00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:25.800
Mr. Jiang,

00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:27.360
I wrote this proposal.

00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:28.280
If it goes to someone else,

00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:29.800
wouldn't that be inappropriate?

00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:32.640
Zhang, you're part of the station.

00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:34.760
[You need to have the big picture.]

00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:35.880
[You need to be open-minded]

00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:38.600
[and know what's more important.]

00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:39.720
[For your dreams,]

00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:41.200
[you need to have a spirit of sacrifice.]

00:38:57.520 --> 00:38:58.600
[When was this decided?]

00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:04.360
I'm done with my resignation letter.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:06.160
What I wanted was

00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:07.360
to let you know

00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:08.400
before submitting it.

00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:09.720
I'm asking you

00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:11.240
when you decided this.

00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:17.920
You've given so much,

00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:19.240
and now you want to leave,

00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:21.280
the timing isn't right.

00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:23.120
It's all the same.

00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:24.560
I'll leave sooner or later anyway.

00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:02.920
Ran,

00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:05.520
why do you like tigers so much?
