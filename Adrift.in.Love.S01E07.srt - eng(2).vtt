[Six years ago]

00:00:21.688 --> 00:00:23.232
I love you.

00:00:28.737 --> 00:00:30.467
Get out of the car.

00:00:31.322 --> 00:00:34.409
- I love you.
- Get out.

00:00:34.409 --> 00:00:36.036
- I love you.
- Get out.

00:00:36.036 --> 00:00:38.800
If you don't get out, we'll die together!

00:00:42.292 --> 00:00:45.003
Get out! Get lost!

00:00:45.003 --> 00:00:46.747
Get lost!

00:00:56.806 --> 00:00:58.189
Love means...

00:00:59.142 --> 00:01:03.354
For a goal that's
more important than yourself...

00:01:03.354 --> 00:01:06.637
you choose to live or die.

[Episode 7: Until death do us part?]

00:02:14.968 --> 00:02:17.332
[I'm back. Remember the cabin?
I'm waiting for you there.]

00:02:38.575 --> 00:02:40.535
Why are you here?

00:02:40.535 --> 00:02:42.734
What if someone sees you?

00:02:44.747 --> 00:02:46.524
I'm worried about you.

00:02:50.628 --> 00:02:52.521
What did the doctor say?

00:02:54.591 --> 00:02:57.569
The doctor said two-thirds
of his heart muscle is damaged.

00:02:58.386 --> 00:03:00.491
He's still in a coma.

00:03:02.223 --> 00:03:04.499
What if he wakes up?

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:08.769
Have you notified the company?

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.241
I don't dare to tell anyone.

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.199
If I wait until he's gone,

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:21.409
it'll only arouse more suspicion.

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:23.968
You must inform the company first.

00:03:30.335 --> 00:03:31.849
Don't worry.

00:03:32.795 --> 00:03:34.446
I'm here.

00:03:43.723 --> 00:03:45.356
Where are you going?

00:03:46.184 --> 00:03:48.353
I'm moving in with Xin Tong.

00:03:48.353 --> 00:03:50.146
What did you say?

00:03:50.146 --> 00:03:52.124
Xin Tong needs me now.

00:03:53.566 --> 00:03:56.204
Unpack your clothes and put them back.

00:03:58.154 --> 00:04:00.073
I'm just moving out.

00:04:00.073 --> 00:04:02.033
I'll still handle company matters.

00:04:02.033 --> 00:04:03.605
Don't worry.

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.663
What's wrong with you?

00:04:06.663 --> 00:04:11.251
You've never gone this far for a woman before.

00:04:11.251 --> 00:04:12.585
I told you.

00:04:12.585 --> 00:04:14.545
Xin Tong is different from other girls.

00:04:14.545 --> 00:04:16.339
When she's feeling a bit better,

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:17.924
I'll bring her home to have dinner with you.

00:04:17.924 --> 00:04:19.634
Then you'll understand what I mean.

00:04:19.634 --> 00:04:22.641
You can't go anywhere without my permission.

00:04:26.933 --> 00:04:28.546
Xin Yi Fu!

00:04:29.686 --> 00:04:31.062
Xin Yi Fu!

00:04:31.062 --> 00:04:32.397
That's enough.

00:04:32.397 --> 00:04:33.557
Xin Tong is waiting for me at home.

00:04:33.557 --> 00:04:35.024
I can't let her wait alone for too long.

00:04:35.024 --> 00:04:36.401
That's enough!

00:04:36.401 --> 00:04:38.945
It's always "Xin Tong this," "Xin Tong that."

00:04:38.945 --> 00:04:40.905
How long have you known her?

00:04:40.905 --> 00:04:43.324
Now, you're disobeying me because of her.

00:04:43.324 --> 00:04:45.451
Don't be so dramatic.

00:04:45.451 --> 00:04:47.550
I'm not running away from home.

00:04:48.788 --> 00:04:50.748
Fine.

00:04:50.748 --> 00:04:52.458
If you're moving out,

00:04:52.458 --> 00:04:55.920
you might as well quit your job
at the company, too.

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.381
I don't think you should be
the vice president anymore.

00:04:58.381 --> 00:05:01.033
Let's see how well you can do out there.

00:05:12.395 --> 00:05:15.773
Fine, I'll quit.

00:05:15.773 --> 00:05:18.525
You've always just doubted me anyway.

00:05:19.402 --> 00:05:22.497
I don't even know what
I'm supposed to do in this company.

00:07:01.003 --> 00:07:02.547
Do you see that?

00:07:02.547 --> 00:07:04.340
Your mom is glaring at you.

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:07.010
She wants to see if you're living happily.

00:07:12.849 --> 00:07:15.351
My mom isn't glaring at me.

00:07:15.351 --> 00:07:17.765
She's clearly smiling happily.

00:07:20.014 --> 00:07:21.660
You're right.

00:07:23.526 --> 00:07:26.904
But your mom seems to be glaring at me.

00:07:26.904 --> 00:07:28.239
Because I promised her

00:07:28.239 --> 00:07:31.031
that I'd make you happy.

00:07:33.578 --> 00:07:35.163
If your mom turns into a ghost,

00:07:35.163 --> 00:07:36.981
will she come for me?

00:07:37.832 --> 00:07:39.499
Do you have a cigarette?

00:07:40.585 --> 00:07:42.879
Do you have a cigarette?

00:07:42.879 --> 00:07:45.798
Son-in-law, do you have a cigarette?

00:07:45.798 --> 00:07:47.650
All right.

00:07:55.892 --> 00:07:58.051
I'll pull myself together.

00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:00.897
- Okay.
- Good.

00:08:00.897 --> 00:08:03.367
Okay, thank you.

00:08:04.692 --> 00:08:07.069
- Good morning, Chief Secretary Zhao.
- Morning.

00:08:12.283 --> 00:08:13.827
Are you all right?

00:08:13.827 --> 00:08:15.620
Don't push yourself.

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:18.080
Don't worry about me. I'm fine.

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:20.500
I'm sorry for troubling you with work.

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:23.752
Now that I'm back,
let me know if you need anything.

00:08:23.752 --> 00:08:24.754
Okay.

00:08:24.754 --> 00:08:26.923
Mr. You and Mr. Zhan have a meeting today.

00:08:26.923 --> 00:08:29.008
I can introduce you to him.

00:08:29.008 --> 00:08:31.890
Mr. You is already inside.

00:08:33.554 --> 00:08:35.431
Who is this Mr. You?

00:08:35.431 --> 00:08:38.100
Mr. You? Everyone calls him Abla.

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:40.228
He used to be Mr. Zhan's driver.

00:08:40.228 --> 00:08:42.230
Don't be fooled by his appearance.

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:46.025
He's now Mr. Zhan's go-to guy
for the stock market.

00:08:50.363 --> 00:08:52.156
Mr. You.

00:08:52.156 --> 00:08:54.158
Hello, Mr. You.
I'm Pan Xin Tong, the secretary.

00:08:54.158 --> 00:08:55.576
Mr. You?

00:08:55.576 --> 00:08:57.411
I'm still inexperienced.

00:08:57.411 --> 00:08:59.582
Just call me Abla.

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:02.500
Don't scare our girls.

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:07.048
Xin Tong is still young,
but she's very capable.

00:09:09.215 --> 00:09:11.467
Then we'll get along well.

00:09:11.467 --> 00:09:14.060
I like capable people.

00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:18.021
Mr. Zhan isn't here yet?

00:10:08.649 --> 00:10:10.838
You're here.

00:10:10.838 --> 00:10:13.039
Long time no see.

00:10:19.285 --> 00:10:21.279
You sent the video, didn't you?

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:27.752
I know that woman married the old man.

00:10:27.752 --> 00:10:29.503
You were dumped.

00:10:29.503 --> 00:10:30.838
So, I came back.

00:10:30.838 --> 00:10:32.798
To get back at us?

00:10:32.798 --> 00:10:35.885
Why would you think that? I'm not that evil.

00:10:35.885 --> 00:10:38.346
Why would I hurt you?

00:10:38.346 --> 00:10:39.721
I bought a lot of food.

00:10:39.721 --> 00:10:40.765
I've also bought wine.

00:10:40.765 --> 00:10:42.266
It'll be enough for a few days.

00:10:42.266 --> 00:10:43.678
Come on.

00:10:49.774 --> 00:10:51.192
What are you doing?

00:10:51.192 --> 00:10:52.443
Where's the money?

00:10:52.443 --> 00:10:55.446
You're not recording this, are you?

00:10:55.446 --> 00:10:58.282
You're so silly.

00:10:58.282 --> 00:11:00.826
Trust me, okay?

00:11:00.826 --> 00:11:04.372
I'm back now, and I'll transfer the money back.

00:11:04.372 --> 00:11:05.998
I mean it.

00:11:05.998 --> 00:11:09.251
Stop recording. Trust me, okay?

00:11:09.251 --> 00:11:11.565
Or you can go to the bank with me tomorrow.

00:11:12.922 --> 00:11:15.733
Let's go. It's hot.

00:11:16.926 --> 00:11:19.679
Zhan Qian Ren is still unconscious.

00:11:19.679 --> 00:11:22.223
His condition is still not optimistic.

00:11:22.223 --> 00:11:23.974
You have to be mentally prepared.

00:11:23.974 --> 00:11:27.062
It might happen in a day or two.

00:11:34.151 --> 00:11:36.578
How did Mr. Zhan suddenly end up like this?

00:11:42.827 --> 00:11:45.162
This won't do. Let's transfer him.

00:11:45.162 --> 00:11:46.831
I know a cardiologist.

00:11:46.831 --> 00:11:48.958
I'm sure he can save Mr. Zhan.

00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:50.931
I'll contact him.

00:11:53.129 --> 00:11:56.382
Ma'am, I'll go back to the office
and inform the board members.

00:11:56.382 --> 00:11:58.300
Thank you for your help at the hospital.

00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:00.645
Call me if you need anything.

00:12:13.733 --> 00:12:16.954
Thin crust or thick crust for the pizza?

00:12:18.362 --> 00:12:19.780
Thin crust.

00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:21.506
Okay.

00:12:25.703 --> 00:12:27.562
This should be enough.

00:12:29.051 --> 00:12:30.527
Here.

00:12:42.344 --> 00:12:44.805
Look at the sunlight outside.

00:12:44.805 --> 00:12:46.724
It's so beautiful.

00:12:46.724 --> 00:12:49.199
It's just like what I saw in New Zealand.

00:12:50.227 --> 00:12:51.270
You know what?

00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:53.939
During my trip to New Zealand,

00:12:53.939 --> 00:12:56.859
I found it's even more beautiful
than I imagined.

00:12:56.859 --> 00:12:59.528
Time moves so slowly there.

00:12:59.528 --> 00:13:01.894
It feels like everything has stopped.

00:13:01.894 --> 00:13:04.163
[Xiao Qi]

00:13:09.413 --> 00:13:11.055
It's so astringent.

00:13:12.416 --> 00:13:14.752
Maybe it needs to breathe a bit more.

00:13:14.752 --> 00:13:16.670
Aren't you going to answer it?

00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:18.506
It's okay.

00:13:18.506 --> 00:13:20.015
Should I cut the bell peppers?

00:13:20.966 --> 00:13:22.171
Yes.

00:13:23.219 --> 00:13:26.481
Are you putting them on the pizza
or making a salad?

00:13:27.765 --> 00:13:29.717
Take a guess.

00:14:39.503 --> 00:14:41.630
Since you're alone in the hospital,

00:14:41.630 --> 00:14:44.734
I brought you some clothes
and daily necessities.

00:14:48.304 --> 00:14:49.856
Thank you.

00:14:51.891 --> 00:14:53.939
You haven't eaten, have you?

00:14:54.894 --> 00:14:56.061
I'm not hungry.

00:14:56.061 --> 00:14:57.907
You can't do that.

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:13.996
This is light. You should eat some.

00:15:13.996 --> 00:15:15.827
I'll eat with you.

00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:20.964
Yours looks better.

00:15:23.714 --> 00:15:26.008
Do you want some?

00:15:26.008 --> 00:15:27.437
Yes.

00:15:40.356 --> 00:15:41.913
Thank you.

00:15:53.953 --> 00:15:56.789
You rarely eat convenience store food, do you?

00:15:56.789 --> 00:15:58.666
Speaking of convenience store food,

00:15:58.666 --> 00:16:00.995
I'm a professional
convenience store foodie of many years,

00:16:00.995 --> 00:16:02.050
also known as a budget expert.

00:16:02.050 --> 00:16:04.213
I can give you some tips.

00:16:04.213 --> 00:16:07.216
If you want fresh food, you have to dig for it.

00:16:07.216 --> 00:16:09.343
The clerks usually put
the soon-to-expire food out front.

00:16:09.343 --> 00:16:10.928
So, the deeper inside, the fresher.

00:16:10.928 --> 00:16:13.055
Here's another money-saving tip
for those who live paycheck to paycheck.

00:16:13.055 --> 00:16:16.433
You must grab bargains
during the discount period for expiring items.

00:16:16.433 --> 00:16:18.227
Every convenience store has different timings.

00:16:18.227 --> 00:16:20.521
Some are at 5 P.M., some are at 7 P.M.

00:16:20.521 --> 00:16:21.981
It depends on when you go to grab them.

00:16:21.981 --> 00:16:24.108
Also, 12 A.M. and early morning

00:16:24.108 --> 00:16:26.318
are when convenience stores restock.

00:16:26.318 --> 00:16:28.862
Food that's about to expire
becomes very cheap then.

00:16:28.862 --> 00:16:30.322
Especially rice balls.

00:16:30.322 --> 00:16:32.162
How did you know?

00:16:35.494 --> 00:16:38.706
Why didn't you ask me what happened?

00:16:38.706 --> 00:16:40.916
Everyone's curious.

00:16:40.916 --> 00:16:43.043
My mom's in the hospital a lot.

00:16:43.043 --> 00:16:45.254
I hate questions like that.

00:16:45.254 --> 00:16:46.961
So, I understand.

00:16:53.303 --> 00:16:56.074
I used to be a convenience store expert, too.

00:17:02.563 --> 00:17:04.244
Aren't you going to eat?

00:17:07.609 --> 00:17:09.319
I'm not hungry.

00:17:09.319 --> 00:17:11.291
It's delicious.

00:17:18.954 --> 00:17:20.188
Hello?

00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:23.959
The doctor said

00:17:23.959 --> 00:17:27.629
he's in critical condition,
and he only has a day or two left.

00:17:27.629 --> 00:17:29.381
I see.

00:17:29.381 --> 00:17:32.342
What about you? Are you okay?

00:17:32.342 --> 00:17:33.786
I'm fine.

00:17:33.786 --> 00:17:36.528
The money should be wired back.

00:17:40.893 --> 00:17:42.352
I'm worried...

00:17:42.352 --> 00:17:45.522
we can't hide the test results.

00:17:45.522 --> 00:17:47.129
Give me a minute.

00:17:54.865 --> 00:17:56.909
Here's the thing.

00:17:56.909 --> 00:18:00.370
A doctor is obligated
to keep a patient's condition confidential.

00:18:00.370 --> 00:18:02.122
If the information is leaked,

00:18:02.122 --> 00:18:05.000
they'll have to take legal responsibility.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.253
You're his legal wife now.

00:18:08.253 --> 00:18:10.839
Even if the baby isn't his,

00:18:10.839 --> 00:18:13.286
you can still inherit his assets.

00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:16.512
So, I'm thinking that...

00:18:16.512 --> 00:18:18.055
if we hadn't met...

00:18:18.055 --> 00:18:19.487
I know.

00:18:20.516 --> 00:18:23.519
Let's not think about what happened.

00:18:23.519 --> 00:18:25.687
Hang in there.

00:18:25.687 --> 00:18:27.042
Okay.

00:18:35.489 --> 00:18:37.488
You're studying so hard
for the college entrance exam.

00:18:38.534 --> 00:18:40.894
I'm reading about small farmers.

00:18:41.703 --> 00:18:44.164
Small farmers? What small farmers?

00:18:44.164 --> 00:18:47.626
I met some farmers when I was
on a business trip in the south.

00:18:47.626 --> 00:18:49.962
They're looking for a partner
to start a skincare brand.

00:18:49.962 --> 00:18:52.114
But they're still short on funds.

00:18:52.114 --> 00:18:56.990
I think I'll talk to some friends and elders.

00:19:00.639 --> 00:19:02.481
You've changed.

00:19:03.142 --> 00:19:05.269
Who are you? I almost don't recognize you.

00:19:05.269 --> 00:19:08.772
How dare you fall out with your mom
and not even show up to work?

00:19:08.772 --> 00:19:11.503
Looks like you're serious
about Xin Tong this time.

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:16.725
I want to use this opportunity to prove myself.

00:19:19.449 --> 00:19:22.033
So, this is what true love is like.

00:19:34.173 --> 00:19:35.513
Here.

00:19:39.511 --> 00:19:43.056
Let's get started. Attorney Ren, you go first.

00:19:43.056 --> 00:19:45.462
Okay. Thank you, Mr. Huang.

00:19:46.393 --> 00:19:49.980
Mr. Zhan stated in
the revised will trust after marriage

00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:51.440
that if anything happens to him,

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:53.650
all his assets will be transferred

00:19:53.650 --> 00:19:59.204
through the trust to Ms. Zhou Xiao Qi.

00:20:06.538 --> 00:20:10.114
Attorney Ren, what do you suggest?

00:20:11.293 --> 00:20:14.463
I suggest that before Mr. Zhan passes away,

00:20:14.463 --> 00:20:16.215
we hold an emergency board meeting

00:20:16.215 --> 00:20:19.009
and nominate Zhou Xiao Qi to replace Mr. Zhan

00:20:19.009 --> 00:20:21.136
as the Chairman of Hongfa.

00:20:21.136 --> 00:20:23.180
Stop fooling around!

00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:24.785
Zhou Xiao Qi knows nothing.

00:20:24.785 --> 00:20:27.684
It's absurd for her to be chairman.

00:20:27.684 --> 00:20:29.645
Maybe she tried to kill Mr. Zhan.

00:20:29.645 --> 00:20:31.251
Vice President Qian.

00:20:46.164 --> 00:20:47.625
Let's go.

00:20:49.248 --> 00:20:53.919
"Hongfa's Chairman Zhan had
a heart attack and is in critical condition."

00:20:53.919 --> 00:20:56.164
Did you see the news?

00:20:59.466 --> 00:21:01.635
That woman is pregnant with your child.

00:21:01.635 --> 00:21:03.303
She's afraid she won't get the inheritance.

00:21:03.303 --> 00:21:05.584
So, you teamed up to kill him?

00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:12.110
You've got quite the imagination.

00:21:13.605 --> 00:21:17.648
Don't think I don't know what you're up to.

00:21:18.986 --> 00:21:22.281
You're his legal wife now.

00:21:22.281 --> 00:21:24.908
Even if the baby isn't his,

00:21:24.908 --> 00:21:27.228
you can still inherit his fortune.

00:21:32.207 --> 00:21:34.084
You bugged my phone?

00:21:34.084 --> 00:21:36.795
That woman made you so scary.

00:21:36.795 --> 00:21:39.253
You're capable of murder now.

00:21:42.759 --> 00:21:44.594
Are you going to kill me, too?

00:21:44.594 --> 00:21:47.264
Since when?

00:21:47.264 --> 00:21:51.768
It's a blessing to die by your hand.

00:21:51.768 --> 00:21:53.895
Do it.

00:21:53.895 --> 00:21:55.741
Kill me.

00:22:12.205 --> 00:22:15.010
Stay for one last dinner with me.

00:22:16.918 --> 00:22:18.993
Then I'll go back to New Zealand.

00:22:20.547 --> 00:22:22.259
I'm tired.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.294
Oh, Sis.

00:22:59.294 --> 00:23:01.630
You've worked so hard
your whole life just to get Hongfa.

00:23:01.630 --> 00:23:03.840
Now that Mr. Zhan is finally dying,

00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:05.675
a great opportunity is coming.

00:23:05.675 --> 00:23:08.512
Do you really want Zhou Xiao Qi
to become chairman?

00:23:08.512 --> 00:23:09.721
Calm down.

00:23:09.721 --> 00:23:13.092
I can't calm down. I can't accept this.

00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:23.318
I know.

00:23:23.318 --> 00:23:25.529
How about I persuade Mr. Huang?

00:23:25.529 --> 00:23:27.656
I'll get him to support you
in the board meeting.

00:23:27.656 --> 00:23:29.492
Plus, we'll have the seats under our directors.

00:23:29.492 --> 00:23:30.492
See?

00:23:30.492 --> 00:23:32.244
You'll definitely be the chairman.

00:23:32.244 --> 00:23:34.947
Don't be so impatient.

00:23:36.039 --> 00:23:38.208
As long as Mr. Zhan is still alive,

00:23:38.208 --> 00:23:40.572
do you think Mr. Huang will listen to you?

00:23:45.424 --> 00:23:49.094
The board election is coming up soon.

00:23:49.094 --> 00:23:55.111
By then, it'll be easy to remove her.

00:23:59.521 --> 00:24:01.692
Hello, this is the secretary's office.

00:24:14.411 --> 00:24:16.121
Hello.

00:24:16.121 --> 00:24:17.914
Are you Ms. Pan?

00:24:17.914 --> 00:24:20.099
- Yes.
- This way, please.

00:24:34.347 --> 00:24:36.600
Director Qian.

00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:38.106
Have a seat.

00:24:43.690 --> 00:24:45.567
That's bird's nest.

00:24:45.567 --> 00:24:47.944
Yi Fu likes to eat it
in the morning or before bed.

00:24:47.944 --> 00:24:49.529
Take it home.

00:24:49.529 --> 00:24:51.198
He's prone to nasal allergies.

00:24:51.198 --> 00:24:53.283
He can't stand a speck of dust.

00:24:53.283 --> 00:24:55.738
Make sure your house is clean.

00:24:57.704 --> 00:25:01.195
Why did you ask me to come here?

00:25:03.168 --> 00:25:06.137
Do you know there was
a class system in the Roman era?

00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:08.340
In ancient Rome,

00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:12.636
there were three classes
of aristocrats, commoners, and slaves.

00:25:12.636 --> 00:25:17.307
In our time,
wealthy capitalists are aristocrats.

00:25:17.307 --> 00:25:21.019
Ordinary professionals are commoners.

00:25:21.019 --> 00:25:22.479
Office workers like you,

00:25:22.479 --> 00:25:25.106
who sell their time to the company,

00:25:25.106 --> 00:25:27.448
are basically slaves.

00:25:28.485 --> 00:25:30.493
What are you trying to say?

00:25:31.279 --> 00:25:34.533
Yi Fu's father and I
built everything from scratch.

00:25:34.533 --> 00:25:37.160
It will all be left to Yi Fu.

00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:39.579
He has connections, wealth,

00:25:39.579 --> 00:25:41.665
education, and experience.

00:25:41.665 --> 00:25:43.047
What about you?

00:25:43.792 --> 00:25:45.417
What do you have?

00:25:51.758 --> 00:25:53.760
Director Qian, if I may be so bold...

00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:56.888
It's 2023, and you're still
talking about ancient Rome.

00:25:56.888 --> 00:25:59.498
No wonder Yi Fu can't communicate with you.

00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:02.894
Everyone has their own values.

00:26:02.894 --> 00:26:06.529
What's important to you
may not be important to others.

00:26:07.732 --> 00:26:09.859
I admire your ambition.

00:26:09.859 --> 00:26:14.098
But this time, you've chosen the wrong person.

00:26:15.073 --> 00:26:17.492
I have to admit,

00:26:17.492 --> 00:26:21.413
you're more resourceful than I thought.

00:26:21.413 --> 00:26:24.207
You not only made Yi Fu
move out to live with you,

00:26:24.207 --> 00:26:27.669
you even made him break ties
with me and leave the company.

00:26:27.669 --> 00:26:29.754
But let me remind you,

00:26:29.754 --> 00:26:32.507
if Xin Yi Fu has nothing,

00:26:32.507 --> 00:26:34.590
will you still love him?

00:26:38.471 --> 00:26:40.849
Don't think you've won.

00:26:40.849 --> 00:26:43.001
This is just the beginning.

00:26:45.437 --> 00:26:47.230
One more thing.

00:26:47.230 --> 00:26:50.233
Don't buy too many personal items for Yi Fu.

00:26:50.233 --> 00:26:52.521
He'll be coming back soon.

00:27:40.492 --> 00:27:45.212
Do you remember the story of this lighter?

00:27:48.083 --> 00:27:51.211
It's the only thing your dad left you.

00:27:51.211 --> 00:27:53.472
You still remember.

00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:59.427
The day you decided to kill yourself
after your mom died...

00:27:59.427 --> 00:28:04.533
At the cliff, what was
the last thing I said to you?

00:28:12.482 --> 00:28:14.192
Love is to live for a purpose

00:28:14.192 --> 00:28:17.034
more important than yourself.

00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:25.370
Your turn.

00:28:25.370 --> 00:28:27.423
Ask me a question.

00:28:32.001 --> 00:28:34.005
There must be one.

00:28:45.056 --> 00:28:47.000
Why do you love me?

00:28:49.477 --> 00:28:51.343
Because you're handsome.

00:28:53.356 --> 00:28:55.550
Because you're a doctor.

00:28:59.112 --> 00:29:01.532
Because you asked me for a massage.

00:29:06.244 --> 00:29:08.556
Thank you for everything you've done for me.

00:29:09.831 --> 00:29:12.062
I'd be dead if it weren't for you.

00:29:48.369 --> 00:29:50.515
What did you give me to drink?

00:29:51.956 --> 00:29:55.376
Did you put something in the wine?

00:29:55.376 --> 00:29:57.507
Don't worry.

00:30:01.841 --> 00:30:04.000
It's just sleeping pills.

00:30:07.972 --> 00:30:10.725
You'll just fall asleep.

00:30:10.725 --> 00:30:13.036
You won't feel a thing.

00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:18.054
I'll be with you soon.

00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:43.169
Clear.

00:30:44.056 --> 00:30:45.517
Clear.

00:30:49.055 --> 00:30:50.947
Six years ago...

00:30:51.933 --> 00:30:54.546
we should have died together.

00:30:57.522 --> 00:30:59.649
We didn't have to wait until this day.

00:30:59.649 --> 00:31:00.859
Yue Jiao.

00:31:00.859 --> 00:31:02.527
Listen to me.

00:31:02.527 --> 00:31:05.179
Put down the knife.

00:31:05.179 --> 00:31:07.418
Put down the knife first.

00:31:10.577 --> 00:31:12.057
Stop recording.

00:31:12.057 --> 00:31:14.497
Who is it even for?

00:31:15.373 --> 00:31:18.334
No one will see it.

00:31:18.334 --> 00:31:20.529
Let go.

00:31:26.968 --> 00:31:28.094
Love...

00:31:28.094 --> 00:31:35.064
It's living or dying is for a purpose
more important than yourself.

00:32:31.449 --> 00:32:32.506
I've contacted them.

00:32:32.506 --> 00:32:34.619
The V.I.P ward has been arranged.

00:32:34.619 --> 00:32:36.857
We can transfer him at any time.

00:32:38.623 --> 00:32:41.094
Clear. Shock.

00:32:43.211 --> 00:32:44.619
Continue.

00:32:50.218 --> 00:32:54.389
Continuing CPR will only
make Mr. Zhan suffer more.

00:32:54.389 --> 00:32:58.710
Why don't you consider letting him go in peace?

00:33:12.573 --> 00:33:14.047
Okay.

00:33:23.209 --> 00:33:26.337
Patient Zhan Qian Ren is pronounced dead.

00:33:26.337 --> 00:33:29.540
Time of death, 6:10 P.M.

00:35:35.967 --> 00:35:37.426
Is this Mrs. Zhan?

00:35:37.426 --> 00:35:39.971
I'm Dr. Wu.

00:35:39.971 --> 00:35:44.375
I'm calling to check on how Mr. Zhan is doing.

00:35:44.375 --> 00:35:46.545
He just passed away.

00:35:48.146 --> 00:35:49.897
What a pity.

00:35:49.897 --> 00:35:52.817
He didn't get to hear the DNA results in time.

00:35:52.817 --> 00:35:56.904
You are carrying his biological child.

00:35:56.904 --> 00:35:58.998
And the child's healthy.

00:36:02.243 --> 00:36:04.745
I'm sorry. I shan't bother you then.

00:36:04.745 --> 00:36:06.600
My condolences.

00:36:39.947 --> 00:36:41.831
Miss, are you all right?

00:36:43.201 --> 00:36:46.999
I don't want it.

00:36:48.044 --> 00:36:50.020
What's the matter?

00:36:53.002 --> 00:36:55.004
Go away!

00:36:55.004 --> 00:36:56.881
- Miss, are you all right?
- Let go of me!

00:36:56.881 --> 00:36:59.091
- Please, take a seat.
- Go away!

00:36:59.091 --> 00:37:02.019
- Calm down.
- You calm down!

00:37:17.318 --> 00:37:20.446
Why are you doing this to me?

00:37:20.446 --> 00:37:23.658
Why?

00:37:23.658 --> 00:37:25.513
Why?

00:39:32.870 --> 00:39:34.479
Xiao Qi!

00:39:51.889 --> 00:39:54.585
Do you want me to buy you a nail clipper?

00:39:55.935 --> 00:39:57.561
No need.

00:40:05.569 --> 00:40:08.132
I've brought Mr. Zhan's clothes.

00:40:15.454 --> 00:40:17.491
I'll get the nurse.

00:40:43.357 --> 00:40:45.484
- Gu Hou Ze!
- It's all right now.

00:40:45.484 --> 00:40:48.195
Gu Hou Ze!

00:40:48.195 --> 00:40:50.448
Gu Hou Ze!

00:40:50.448 --> 00:40:52.241
- Gu Hou Ze!
- It's all right.

00:40:52.241 --> 00:40:53.951
- Gu Hou Ze!
- Keep her down.

00:40:53.951 --> 00:40:55.453
- Gu Hou Ze!
- Hold her tight.

00:40:55.453 --> 00:40:58.664
Gu Hou Ze, come in!

00:40:58.664 --> 00:41:00.291
Gu Hou Ze, don't stand there!

00:41:00.291 --> 00:41:01.292
- Come in!
- Don't move!

00:41:01.292 --> 00:41:03.919
- Gu Hou Ze!
- All right. It's all right.

00:41:03.919 --> 00:41:06.005
Gu Hou Ze!

00:41:06.005 --> 00:41:08.340
- Gu Hou Ze!
- It's all right now.

00:41:08.340 --> 00:41:11.051
Gu Hou Ze!

00:41:11.051 --> 00:41:13.721
Gu Hou Ze!

00:41:13.721 --> 00:41:15.993
- Gu Hou Ze!
- It's all right.

00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:31.780
Didn't you tell me about this case before?

00:41:31.780 --> 00:41:33.949
Yes.
[Borderline personality disorder, BPD]

00:41:33.949 --> 00:41:35.993
She has borderline personality disorder.

00:41:35.993 --> 00:41:37.503
Actually...

00:41:40.289 --> 00:41:43.459
we used to date.

00:41:43.459 --> 00:41:46.337
She has severe delusional jealousy.

00:41:46.337 --> 00:41:48.255
She'll imagine I'm having
an abnormal relationship

00:41:48.255 --> 00:41:50.508
with other female patients.

00:41:50.508 --> 00:41:55.016
She'll also make up things that never happened.

00:41:56.472 --> 00:41:59.558
How was she with the medication before?

00:41:59.558 --> 00:42:01.018
She was very resistant to it.

00:42:01.018 --> 00:42:03.062
It doesn't sound like she's doing well.

00:42:03.062 --> 00:42:04.546
Yes.

00:42:06.690 --> 00:42:10.319
She's also starting to hurt others and herself.

00:42:10.319 --> 00:42:12.279
Considering she has no other family members,

00:42:12.279 --> 00:42:15.938
that's why I initiated
this compulsory hospitalization.

00:42:16.951 --> 00:42:19.641
I hope she can rest here under your care.

00:42:20.721 --> 00:42:22.048
All right.

00:42:23.165 --> 00:42:25.584
If it's convenient, please give me a copy

00:42:25.584 --> 00:42:27.478
of her previous medical records.

00:42:29.088 --> 00:42:30.506
Okay.

00:42:30.506 --> 00:42:33.031
That's all. I'll make the arrangements.

00:42:49.608 --> 00:42:50.985
Ms. Zhou.

00:42:50.985 --> 00:42:55.614
This is the paternity test report
from the nail sample you sent.

00:42:55.614 --> 00:42:59.159
The doctor will explain it in detail later.

00:42:59.159 --> 00:43:00.806
Thank you.

00:43:08.264 --> 00:43:10.877
[Noninvasive Prenatal Test Report]

00:43:17.239 --> 00:43:25.103
[DNA test results of sample from Zhan Qian Ren
shows he is the father of Zhou Xiao Qi's child]

00:43:52.630 --> 00:43:55.591
Don't be nervous, dear.

00:43:55.591 --> 00:43:59.386
The surgery will be over
in about 10 or 20 minutes.

00:43:59.386 --> 00:44:00.471
Relax.

00:44:00.471 --> 00:44:04.027
Once the anesthesia kicks in,
you won't feel a thing.

00:44:07.144 --> 00:44:09.647
I don't want to.

00:44:09.647 --> 00:44:11.958
I don't want to.

00:44:32.670 --> 00:44:34.966
Hello, Chairwoman.

00:44:37.257 --> 00:44:38.425
Hello, Chairwoman.

00:44:38.425 --> 00:44:40.219
Hello, Chairwoman.

00:44:40.219 --> 00:44:42.888
- Hello, Chairwoman.
- Hello, Chairwoman.

00:44:42.888 --> 00:44:44.515
Hello, Chairwoman.

- Hello, Chairwoman.
- Hello, Chairwoman.

00:45:13.711 --> 00:45:17.923
All assets under Mr. Zhan's name
have been transferred to an inheritance trust.

00:45:17.923 --> 00:45:21.176
I will assist in managing this estate

00:45:21.176 --> 00:45:23.095
according to the trust
Mr. Zhan established during his lifetime.

00:45:23.095 --> 00:45:26.640
Aside from daily living
and necessary expenses for raising the child,

00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:30.894
the trust will provide you
with a monthly allowance of 250,000 yuan.

00:45:30.894 --> 00:45:34.398
As for Mr. Zhan's unfinished term
as Hongfa's chairman,

00:45:34.398 --> 00:45:38.444
it has been approved
by the board of directors for you to succeed.

00:45:38.444 --> 00:45:40.821
These are all Mr. Zhan's arrangements.

00:45:40.821 --> 00:45:43.657
The chairwoman's monthly salary
will be 750,000 yuan.

00:45:43.657 --> 00:45:45.242
I believe this income

00:45:45.242 --> 00:45:48.523
can provide financial security
for you and your child.

00:45:51.498 --> 00:45:53.751
Excuse me, Attorney Ren.

00:45:53.751 --> 00:45:56.128
Actually, I don't understand
how the company works at all.

00:45:56.128 --> 00:45:58.255
Can I just sell my company shares

00:45:58.255 --> 00:46:00.966
and not worry about anything?

00:46:00.966 --> 00:46:04.678
There's a 20-year limit
to the inheritance trust.

00:46:04.678 --> 00:46:06.638
What does that mean?

00:46:06.638 --> 00:46:10.142
It means that before the child turns 20,

00:46:10.142 --> 00:46:14.062
all the real estate and Hongfa shares
under Mr. Zhan's name

00:46:14.062 --> 00:46:15.826
cannot be sold.

00:46:17.441 --> 00:46:20.152
- But...
- Mr. Zhan made this arrangement

00:46:20.152 --> 00:46:23.155
because he hopes you will
manage the company well,

00:46:23.155 --> 00:46:26.577
and also raise your child
to be an outstanding entrepreneur.
