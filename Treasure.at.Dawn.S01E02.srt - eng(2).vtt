00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:13.470
For all the past years,

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.530
I always knew that you were a better physician

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:18.330
than I was.

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:20.650
I forbade you to do visits

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:23.420
because I wasn't sure if you could stay focused.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:24.850
I wanted you to have patience.

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:27.050
Who would have thought

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.120
that you'd put yourself on the list

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:31.630
of the four pests?

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.850
I was trying to save people.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.070
You know that!

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.140
You may have goodwill,

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.410
but what you got

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.560
is everyone's detestation.

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:43.770
You should

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:45.710
watch your behavior.

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:47.770
OK.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.180

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:10.870
did you just permit me to make visits?

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:12.190
I want you to close your eyes first.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.010
Feel this.

How many hairs are under the cloth?

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:21.740
If your answer is correct,

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:23.700
then you can go about your visits.

One human hair, one ox hair.

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:40.570
Did I get it right?

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:47.060
Now what, dad?

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.980
Can I go on visits now?

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:50.410
Sheng,

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:52.850
Illness is what you see,

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:54.410
but it's human lives that are on the line.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.540
Be always on your toes,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.340
and don't take things for granted.

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.060
Got it, Dad.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.410
I've heard that one time too many.

the aide arrested me

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:51.800
for three reasons.

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:53.360
I also have three reasons

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.880
to be a part of the investigation.

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.880
Fu Sheng,

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.360
my reasons are logical.

my reasons

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:03.990
are all genuine.

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:05.400
- What reasons... - First,

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:09.080
I'm the clerk of the county.

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:12.320
Autopsy is within my duty.

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.120
Second, my father is a victim.

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:17.160
As his son,

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:19.640
I'm obligated to find the murderer and revenge my father.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.270
Third,

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:23.360
and this is the most important one,

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:24.950
I'm a suspect in this case,

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.400
and I don't think there's anyone with a stronger desire

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:28.670
to find out the truth more than me

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:29.800
since it's my innocence that's on the line.

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:33.090

- We've never seen it! - My lord, we really haven't!

00:08:56.950 --> 00:08:58.100
We really haven't!

00:08:58.550 --> 00:08:59.790
Don't hurt my mom!

00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:04.580
Kiddo,

00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:08.580
have you seen the thing I'm looking for?

00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:09.420
No.

00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:12.990
I really want to find what I've lost.

00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:14.510
You shouldn't lie to me.

00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:15.710
No, I haven't seen it.

00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:16.950
Really?

00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:18.230
Yes.

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:20.150
We've never seen something like that,

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:20.660
my lord!

00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:24.950
What a pity.

00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:29.470
You've seen my face.

00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:30.230
My lord!

We've seen nothing!

My lord!

00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:32.950
I've seen nothing!

Yes.

You are late.

My master has passed away.

This city

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:02.510
will never get another gynecological master like him.

You shouldn't have suffered so much!

Master! You...

00:10:13.450 --> 00:10:13.830
What?

00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:15.750
You are looking for me.

00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:29.940
What kind of medicine could be so powerful?

00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:30.460
How come my father's expression

00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:31.660
looks different from the others?

Fu Sheng.

00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:43.830
Why is Wen Jue waiting outside?

00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:45.940
She refused when I asked her to come in together,

00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:47.460
and said I should also stay outside.

00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:49.150
I wasn't sure

00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:50.940
about what kind of the poison is in this room

00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:52.150
and I was afraid she'd touch it accidentally,

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:53.590
so I asked her to wait outside.

00:11:57.070 --> 00:11:57.980
Am I going to be okay?

00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:00.110
Yes.

00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:03.150
I've figured out the source of the poison.

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:04.310
As long as you don't drink it,

00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:05.550
nothing's going to happen.

00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:08.310
Good.

00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:09.790
Oh, right!

00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:10.910
I brought you the guy.

Dr. Fu.

00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:15.110
Liu Ji,

00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:16.910
do you know

00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:19.040
the ingredients of the medicinal tea?

00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:20.390
The gang

00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:21.940
bought the ingredients together.

00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:24.150
A few days ago, my master learned

00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:25.550
from the Eastern Market

00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:26.700
that some merchant

00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:28.500
is selling a batch of rare medicine at low prices.

00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:29.910
The amount was huge

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:31.310
and he couldn't seal the deal himself.

00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:32.500
That's why

00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:34.400
he told the other physicians

00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:35.860
and they bought the medicines together.

00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:37.740
After they got the medicines,

00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:39.740
they noticed changes in the smells.

00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:42.590
Physician Fu brought everyone together to discuss

00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:45.350
if the properties of the medicines have changed

00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:46.410
and if they can be used.

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:49.100
Could the medicines have been poisoned?

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:50.960
Oh!

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:52.120
I brought some.

00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:53.050
Here.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.160
Is the seller

00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:08.290
still in Shangyi?

00:13:08.770 --> 00:13:11.090

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:12.680
and stayed in our clinic.

You treat the lives of the people of Shangyi like nothing.

what about that guy?

00:16:29.530 --> 00:16:30.570
He did kill all the familiar members

00:16:30.570 --> 00:16:32.290

Who's standing in the way?

00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:04.910

00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:06.380

let's not get rough here.

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:17.170
I apologize for the tension.

00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:19.480
Our caravan encountered bandits before,

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:20.850
that's why the guys

00:17:20.850 --> 00:17:22.060
has been vigilant lately.

00:17:23.530 --> 00:17:25.210
You must be their young master.

00:17:25.570 --> 00:17:26.370
Yours truly.

00:17:26.930 --> 00:17:29.360
Are you the one who sold all those medicines

00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:30.500
with low prices in Shangyi?

00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:32.440
Our caravan was looted

00:17:32.650 --> 00:17:34.880
and all our medicines were lost.

00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:37.290
The medicines must have come from them.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.350
Your caravan

00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:40.650
is fully staffed.

00:17:40.930 --> 00:17:42.760
How did the bandits pull it off so easily?

00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:45.600
You don't know the whole truth.

00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:48.440
The bandits have excellent combat skills

00:17:48.690 --> 00:17:50.160
and are well organized.

00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:52.850
They retreated in an instant after they got the medicines.

00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:55.790
My security head didn't get to chase them.

00:17:56.610 --> 00:17:58.000
They are not new to this.

00:17:58.270 --> 00:18:00.440
I did notice that the bandit leader

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:03.330
was wearing heavy armor.

00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:05.410
He doesn't seem to be an ordinary bandit.

00:18:07.690 --> 00:18:09.130
I don't think the answer

00:18:09.410 --> 00:18:10.330
is too complicated.

00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:12.330
Zhao Sihu, one of the four pests,

00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:14.130
is the only one with a team

00:18:14.130 --> 00:18:15.200
equipped with horses.

00:18:15.610 --> 00:18:17.330
I think we just need to find him

00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:18.690
and ask him in person.

00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:25.920
Why haven't the bandits come yet?

00:18:28.390 --> 00:18:29.790
Are you sure they're here?

00:18:30.490 --> 00:18:31.700
It can't be.

00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:34.000
They should

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.840
have arrived by now.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.070
You mean those masked men,

00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:38.440
the bandits,

00:18:38.890 --> 00:18:40.600
always rob along this road?

00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:43.120
You are just sitting back and waiting.

00:18:56.990 --> 00:18:58.160
Here they are.

00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:07.980
It took so long.

00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:09.400
We're here.

00:19:10.430 --> 00:19:11.030
Here.

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:30.840
We're friends.

00:19:31.030 --> 00:19:32.600
I thought he had some tricks.

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:34.080
But he's just a fool.

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:36.200
What's going on?

00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:36.870
Gu Tian.

00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:43.230
If you have anything to save your life, take it.

00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:45.540
Are you okay?

00:19:46.130 --> 00:19:46.620
Move.

00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:51.140
When County Magistrate Yang sees this,

00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:52.190
he will know I'm in danger

00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:53.540
and the backup will be here soon.

00:19:56.830 --> 00:19:58.540
You think we can hold that long?

00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:03.070
We are friends.

00:20:03.070 --> 00:20:03.830
Don't...

00:20:05.890 --> 00:20:06.630
Sorry.

00:20:28.990 --> 00:20:29.830
It's you.

00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:43.020
The armor! You are the fake bandit who stole the herbs.

00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:45.220
I will die anyway,

00:20:45.390 --> 00:20:47.190
so does it matter who kills me?

00:20:47.190 --> 00:20:47.950
Let's go.

00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:48.780
Forward!

00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:51.920
Let's go.

00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:52.460
Retreat!

00:20:57.710 --> 00:20:59.540
They're not Shangyi's rescuers.

00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:00.870
They're real bandits.

00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:03.390
What should we do?

00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:08.020
Long time no see, Crazy Fu.

00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:10.510
Didn't expect you would have this day.

00:21:11.660 --> 00:21:13.020
Dismount and take off your clothes.

00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:27.980
[Zhao Sihu]

00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:36.560
Nice.

00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:39.750
I should have seen you again yesterday.

00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:41.590
But I was occupied.

00:21:42.220 --> 00:21:43.780
How are you feeling these days?

00:21:44.990 --> 00:21:46.070
Feel the same.

00:21:46.510 --> 00:21:48.460
I can't get the energy to do anything.

00:21:50.390 --> 00:21:51.780
Not even interested in robbing people.

00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:53.950
If I hadn't heard that

00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:55.580
you had this problem,

00:21:56.070 --> 00:21:58.050
I would be drinking in the village right now.

00:21:58.420 --> 00:21:59.620
You're drinking again?

00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:04.130
No, I'm not.

00:22:04.130 --> 00:22:04.940
I just

00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:07.250
took a little sip.

00:22:08.090 --> 00:22:09.740
You can ask them.

00:22:11.010 --> 00:22:12.060
How much did he drink?

00:22:19.820 --> 00:22:20.980
No, stop.

00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:22.650
Easy.

00:22:25.180 --> 00:22:26.330
Stop yelling.

00:22:27.250 --> 00:22:28.210
Listen.

00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:30.300
The heart is to circulate blood,

00:22:30.450 --> 00:22:32.060
and the liver is to keep it.

00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:34.510
This liver conflicts with alcohol.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:36.680
Your internal organs are already at the end of their strength.

00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:38.480
If you still don't listen to me,

00:22:38.590 --> 00:22:39.860
you won't survive the end of the month.

00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:42.020
This life is your own.

00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:45.460
But when you go out, don't tell others

00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:46.780
that I saved you.

00:22:46.830 --> 00:22:47.990
I can't afford to lose face.

00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:50.780
I told you I had palpitations and couldn't breathe.

00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:53.020
But you aimed at my liver.

00:22:53.780 --> 00:22:56.950
If your liver is damaged, your heart will also be affected.

00:22:57.140 --> 00:22:58.950
That's why I don't let you drink, okay?

00:22:58.950 --> 00:23:00.940
Alright, alright.

00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:02.590
Crazy Fu.

00:23:03.270 --> 00:23:04.060
No.

00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:05.180
Physician Fu.

00:23:05.470 --> 00:23:06.590
I saved you.

00:23:06.590 --> 00:23:07.710
So

00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:09.140
you won't charge me, right?

00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:09.870
Sure.

00:23:10.870 --> 00:23:12.270
It's not fair.

00:23:12.590 --> 00:23:14.630
It's fine. His words make sense.

00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:16.710
Are you silly?

00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:18.270
Who do you think you are?

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.990
These people are kidnapping and extorting people

00:23:20.990 --> 00:23:22.110
under your name.

00:23:22.110 --> 00:23:22.850
If it weren't for us,

00:23:22.850 --> 00:23:24.100
you would have been blamed.

00:23:25.150 --> 00:23:26.630
So this time you saved us

00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:27.820
and it can be even,

00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:29.390
but you should pay him

00:23:29.390 --> 00:23:30.430
for the treatment.

00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:34.940
This is the first time

00:23:35.150 --> 00:23:36.630
I've heard of such a thing.

00:23:37.310 --> 00:23:38.820
Take them back

00:23:39.270 --> 00:23:40.510
and torture them.

00:23:40.790 --> 00:23:42.060
I want to see

00:23:42.340 --> 00:23:43.220
who has the guts

00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:45.180
to do this.

00:23:45.270 --> 00:23:45.980
Here.

00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:48.430
Leader.

00:23:48.630 --> 00:23:50.030
Troops from Shangyi are coming soon.

00:23:55.940 --> 00:23:56.750
Guys.

00:23:58.180 --> 00:23:59.220
Farewell.

00:24:02.030 --> 00:24:02.510
Let's go.

00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:07.460
No wonder you dared to meet Zhao Sihu.

00:24:07.790 --> 00:24:09.790
You two had such a connection.

00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:12.580
I repaid the favor Zhao Sihu did

00:24:12.580 --> 00:24:13.910
for saving us today,

00:24:13.910 --> 00:24:14.910
so you two

00:24:14.910 --> 00:24:16.580
should also owe me a favor.

00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:18.860
Now you become smart.

00:24:19.050 --> 00:24:19.750
Fine.

00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:21.470
But my favor is valuable,

00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:22.020
don't waste it.

00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:22.780
I know.

00:24:25.030 --> 00:24:25.950
Physician Fu.

00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:28.230
I almost forgot your father's instructions.

00:24:28.550 --> 00:24:30.090
He asked me to give this to you.

00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:34.150
Bye.

00:24:37.670 --> 00:24:38.510
What's this?

00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:40.670
My father's medical book.

00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:42.430
I left it there.

00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:46.320
Sir.

00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:48.080
This time we are defeated.

00:24:48.230 --> 00:24:49.750
This is the first time we've lost so many men.

00:24:51.470 --> 00:24:52.020
Go.

00:24:53.550 --> 00:24:55.240
Block all the intersections in Shangyi.

00:24:55.550 --> 00:24:57.080
As long as this person is in Shangyi,

00:24:57.750 --> 00:24:58.790
we have a chance.

00:24:58.790 --> 00:24:59.440
Yes.

00:25:11.870 --> 00:25:12.790
What do you mean?

00:25:17.030 --> 00:25:18.480
That's what I want to ask you.

00:25:18.820 --> 00:25:20.100
I've been following Fu Sheng,

00:25:20.270 --> 00:25:21.460
just testing him.

00:25:22.590 --> 00:25:24.480
Now I'm sure the jade plate is with him.

00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:26.030
I'll go back to him for dinner later.

00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:26.840
And then...

00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:28.390
Do you think I will still believe you?

00:25:31.970 --> 00:25:32.970
No.

00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:34.810
But it's your only chance.

00:25:44.810 --> 00:25:45.550
You're back.

00:25:46.810 --> 00:25:48.810
Come on then.

00:25:50.810 --> 00:25:51.620
Here.

00:25:52.170 --> 00:25:53.500
Try this.

00:26:02.130 --> 00:26:02.820
Eat.

00:26:03.390 --> 00:26:05.680
Fu Sheng, I want to ask you a favor.

00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:07.390
We're friends.

00:26:07.390 --> 00:26:08.480
You don't have to ask.

00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:09.510
Just say it.

00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:13.600
Can I borrow your

00:26:14.230 --> 00:26:15.600
Bird Jade Plate?

00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:22.510
How do you know the Bird Jade Plate?

00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:25.030
What are you going to do with it?

00:26:26.390 --> 00:26:28.030
Lend it to me or not?

00:26:28.750 --> 00:26:30.080
I've helped you much.

00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:32.750
You can't just pretend to be stupid.

00:26:39.410 --> 00:26:40.930
They all say I'm crazy,

00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:43.770
but I don't think you're any better than me.

00:26:44.170 --> 00:26:45.620
You came to my place to grab things

00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:47.500
and you are still so tough?

00:26:52.530 --> 00:26:53.690
So you won't lend it to me.

00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:15.650
You are on the same side.

00:27:15.650 --> 00:27:16.340
Fu Sheng.

00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:18.380
My final advice to you.

00:27:18.970 --> 00:27:20.300
Hand over the Bird Jade Plate

00:27:20.770 --> 00:27:21.940
and I will let you go.

00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:26.220
I didn't expect you could do this.

00:27:26.730 --> 00:27:27.850
I saw you as a friend.

00:27:28.970 --> 00:27:30.820
But you are here for the plate, too.

00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:33.300
A man is innocent,

00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:35.490
but guilty of possessing a treasure.

00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:37.180
Hand it over.

00:27:37.490 --> 00:27:38.820
Stop hurting innocent people.

00:27:40.890 --> 00:27:42.220
You killed my father?

00:27:44.730 --> 00:27:45.610
Sort of.

00:27:46.490 --> 00:27:49.220
And you also killed those physicians

00:27:49.730 --> 00:27:51.060
and their families?

00:27:51.370 --> 00:27:53.730
Now you know how worthy these things are.

00:27:56.970 --> 00:27:57.820
Yeah.

00:27:59.250 --> 00:28:00.420
And then?

00:28:02.610 --> 00:28:03.970
I'm not giving it to you.

00:28:05.610 --> 00:28:06.890
Then don't blame me

00:28:08.250 --> 00:28:09.420
for being rude.

00:28:21.370 --> 00:28:22.580
You do have some tricks.

00:28:25.610 --> 00:28:26.420
Thank you

00:28:27.250 --> 00:28:28.850
for helping me take down two losers.

00:28:29.850 --> 00:28:30.820
Don't get me wrong.

00:28:31.250 --> 00:28:32.610
I never kill anyone.

00:28:32.650 --> 00:28:34.540
They just fainted.

00:28:36.010 --> 00:28:36.610
Gu Tian.

00:28:44.370 --> 00:28:44.940
Gu Tian.

00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:46.420
We've known each other for a while.

00:28:46.540 --> 00:28:47.700
I'm warning you

00:28:47.970 --> 00:28:49.490
My Ghost Needle has something.

00:28:50.770 --> 00:28:51.650
Ghost Needle?

00:28:53.250 --> 00:28:55.010
Isn't that something from the tale?

00:29:02.970 --> 00:29:03.890
Hurry up.

00:29:04.940 --> 00:29:06.220
You want to die with him?

00:29:07.490 --> 00:29:08.420
Do it!

00:29:35.610 --> 00:29:36.420
Take him!

00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:40.940
It's a mess, huh?

00:29:42.750 --> 00:29:43.890
You little brat,

00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:45.460
dare to fight against us?

00:29:57.190 --> 00:29:58.370
It's a good trick.

00:29:59.860 --> 00:30:01.070
You performed well.

00:30:01.620 --> 00:30:03.670
I have something to confess to you.

00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:04.910
Tell me.

00:30:07.220 --> 00:30:08.980
The man pretending to be a bandit

00:30:09.390 --> 00:30:10.740
came after your Bird Jade Plate.

00:30:11.030 --> 00:30:11.670
Jade plate?

00:30:13.190 --> 00:30:14.370
How did he know it?

00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:16.920
Wait, you know it too?

00:30:17.450 --> 00:30:18.330
You know

00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:19.170
what I

00:30:19.380 --> 00:30:20.660
live on.

00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:24.090
My men heard about these outsiders,

00:30:24.290 --> 00:30:25.420
and they were looking for

00:30:25.420 --> 00:30:27.020
a Bird Jade Plate with a high reward.

00:30:27.570 --> 00:30:28.690
I happened to see it

00:30:29.330 --> 00:30:31.090
in your medicine box,

00:30:32.930 --> 00:30:33.900
and wanted to make a fortune,

00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:36.810
so I planned to steal your plate.

00:30:38.260 --> 00:30:40.380
No wonder you looked so wrong.

00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:41.500
You approached Fu Sheng

00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:43.260
just for that plate thing?

00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:46.620
At first I was.

00:30:47.330 --> 00:30:48.140
But

00:30:48.450 --> 00:30:49.900
I never told anyone

00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:50.970
that you have the jade plate.

00:30:51.170 --> 00:30:52.320
But I didn't expect

00:30:52.570 --> 00:30:53.450
those people

00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:55.530
would be so cruel.

00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:57.000
They killed many people

00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:58.000
for the jade plate.

00:30:59.130 --> 00:31:00.560
I realized something was wrong,

00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:03.040
but he threatened me with more innocent lives,

00:31:03.850 --> 00:31:05.450
so I could only pretend to obey.

00:31:07.590 --> 00:31:08.590
What are you going to do?

00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:11.570
I need your help.

00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:14.160
They disguised as bandits to launch attack,

00:31:14.550 --> 00:31:15.760
so their target is you.

00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:17.760
We can only take the initiative

00:31:18.590 --> 00:31:20.110
and never let him leave Shangyi.

00:31:23.830 --> 00:31:24.590
Alright.

00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:26.070
I'll help you.

00:31:26.820 --> 00:31:30.580
[Fair and Impartial]

00:31:40.190 --> 00:31:42.100
Looks like you picked the wrong path.

00:31:42.780 --> 00:31:44.510
No, you chose the wrong path.

00:31:47.060 --> 00:31:48.300
Within the three-day deadline,

00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:49.580
Fu Sheng fulfilled his mission

00:31:49.780 --> 00:31:52.150
and found the real culprit for the death of the physicians.

00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:55.340
He's also the thief who pretended to be a bandit and kidnapped the caravan

00:31:55.340 --> 00:31:56.860
and attacked us on the way.

00:31:57.540 --> 00:31:58.060
Yes.

00:31:58.430 --> 00:32:00.020
He has just admitted the guilt

00:32:00.020 --> 00:32:01.100
in his confession.

00:32:02.190 --> 00:32:03.230
The taste

00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:04.860
of those medicinal herbs

00:32:05.020 --> 00:32:06.780
changed after they were poisoned.

00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:08.510
And the herbs the physicians used

00:32:08.510 --> 00:32:09.900
to make medicinal tea

00:32:10.170 --> 00:32:11.820
were the poison that killed them.

00:32:13.150 --> 00:32:14.190
Suspect,

00:32:14.540 --> 00:32:15.620
do you plead guilty?

00:32:16.750 --> 00:32:17.750
He's telling the truth.

00:32:17.860 --> 00:32:18.620
Well.

00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:20.390
Since you confessed.

00:32:20.620 --> 00:32:21.470
Guards!

00:32:21.820 --> 00:32:22.950
Let him sign.

00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:24.100
Wait.

00:32:24.860 --> 00:32:25.580
Sir.

00:32:26.190 --> 00:32:28.430
I have a piece of evidence in my arms.

00:32:29.060 --> 00:32:30.230
Do you want to see it?

00:32:30.620 --> 00:32:32.020
Don't play tricks on me.

00:32:32.260 --> 00:32:33.820
For your future, sir,

00:32:34.620 --> 00:32:35.990
I suggest you

00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:37.580
to take a look at it yourself.

00:32:41.390 --> 00:32:42.580
Don't you dare?

00:32:44.620 --> 00:32:46.060
Why don't I dare?

Untie him, now!

00:33:05.620 --> 00:33:07.880
Magistrate Yang, what do you mean?

00:33:10.060 --> 00:33:11.580
The little Xichuan.

00:33:11.950 --> 00:33:13.150
You're so arrogant.

00:33:13.580 --> 00:33:14.340
How dare you?

00:33:14.340 --> 00:33:15.020
Shut up!

00:33:16.230 --> 00:33:17.020
Princess.

[Jibei King]
This is the official

00:33:19.750 --> 00:33:21.430
sent by the Jibei Mansion.

00:33:22.230 --> 00:33:23.540
Though Xichuan, to which you belong,

00:33:24.020 --> 00:33:25.910
is also an independent country,

00:33:26.150 --> 00:33:28.390
it is still a small vassal state,

00:33:28.670 --> 00:33:30.300
its strength is far inferior

00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:32.060
to that of Jibei State.

What king?

Jibei King?

00:33:42.990 --> 00:33:44.020
I told you

00:33:44.730 --> 00:33:45.830
you chose the wrong path.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:51.530

is quite cute.

We can talk

00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:03.210
later.

00:34:05.170 --> 00:34:06.450
Why did the Jibei King kill my father?

00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:07.930
Fu Sheng, what are you talking about?

00:34:08.650 --> 00:34:10.040
But they did it.

00:34:10.690 --> 00:34:12.040
They also robbed caravans

00:34:12.370 --> 00:34:15.080
and sold the stolen herbs at low prices in Shangyi.

00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:16.000
How dare you?

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:17.170
He's right.

00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:34.650
Try it.

00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:42.410
Fu Sheng!

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:46.840
How about it?

00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:50.320
It's not poisonous.

00:34:52.210 --> 00:34:53.410
It doesn't make sense.

00:34:53.730 --> 00:34:54.690
Because this drug

00:34:54.930 --> 00:34:55.890
is not toxic at all.

00:34:58.930 --> 00:34:59.760
There was

00:35:00.410 --> 00:35:02.520
a mysterious group lurking in Jibei for years,

00:35:02.730 --> 00:35:03.760
plotting a rebellion,

00:35:04.410 --> 00:35:05.210
and the mansion

00:35:05.450 --> 00:35:06.560
had long been eyeing them.

00:35:06.930 --> 00:35:08.560
Among them was an important figure,

00:35:09.130 --> 00:35:11.800
who was meticulous and good at disguise.

00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:14.210
He settled in Shangyi as a physician.

00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:17.170
He was poisoned strangely, so he was immune to all poisons.

00:35:17.370 --> 00:35:19.560
Only this medicine called Quexian

00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:21.760
could force out the strange poison in his body.

00:35:21.930 --> 00:35:24.410
Others won't be poisoned if they eat this.

00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:26.690
I wanted to use this trick to lure this man out,

00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:27.600
but he poisoned

00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:28.970
all the physicians

00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:30.410
and confuse the public.

00:35:31.730 --> 00:35:33.080
What a cruel person!

00:35:33.930 --> 00:35:36.040
But they're already dead,

00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:37.730
why does he still hide his identity?

00:35:37.970 --> 00:35:39.600
Because he stole

00:35:40.970 --> 00:35:42.520
an important thing from the mansion.

00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:49.950
Do you know what it is?

00:35:56.830 --> 00:35:57.630
Sir.

00:35:58.470 --> 00:35:59.300
I want an autopsy.

00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:00.280
Well...

00:36:00.550 --> 00:36:01.350
Let him.

00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:04.280
Don't escape with the treasure.

00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:06.240
Send two men to keep an eye on him.

00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:09.520
I'm on it now.

00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:20.310
After examining so many bodies,

00:36:21.150 --> 00:36:22.520
have you found anything?

00:36:26.310 --> 00:36:27.520
What do you mean?

00:36:30.680 --> 00:36:31.480
It's the heart.

00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:34.590
From the extent of damage to their organs,

00:36:34.590 --> 00:36:35.550
I could tell

00:36:35.910 --> 00:36:36.960
they had been poisoned.

00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:39.960
The poison entered the blood from the stomach

00:36:40.070 --> 00:36:41.520
and then to the heart.

00:36:42.310 --> 00:36:44.390
My father's blood contains a strange poison,

00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:48.390
which will be activated once it meets with Quexian,

00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:50.480
and become a deadly poison.

00:36:50.910 --> 00:36:54.110
So my father's organs are least affected,

00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:57.720
which explains why his expression

00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:00.040
is different from those people.

00:37:06.910 --> 00:37:08.760
I don't get it. Why?

00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:10.550
It means

00:37:11.550 --> 00:37:13.000
The man they are looking for is my father.

00:37:14.350 --> 00:37:15.760
He knew he was going to die,

00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:18.390
so he gathered the physicians,

00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:20.150
shared ancient prescriptions,

00:37:21.070 --> 00:37:22.630
and finally killed them.

00:37:23.350 --> 00:37:24.590
But I really don't understand,

00:37:25.630 --> 00:37:27.280
if he knew he was going to die,

00:37:28.110 --> 00:37:29.350
why didn't he take refuge?

00:37:30.110 --> 00:37:31.390
So many lives were gone

00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:33.760
just like that.

00:37:37.300 --> 00:37:39.010
Because of the Bird Jade Plate in your hand.

00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:41.550
The Bird Jade Plate?

00:37:44.700 --> 00:37:45.490
Mr. Ruan.

00:37:46.860 --> 00:37:49.220
I didn't recognize you today.

00:37:49.540 --> 00:37:51.090
Please accept my apologies.

00:37:51.390 --> 00:37:52.820
I will take Fu Sheng away

00:37:53.190 --> 00:37:54.230
after he finishes the autopsy.

00:37:56.860 --> 00:37:57.670
Mr. Ruan.

00:37:58.060 --> 00:37:58.990
I checked

00:37:59.190 --> 00:38:02.100
the warrants issued by the imperial court before,

00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:04.860
and Fu Sheng doesn't seem to be on them.

00:38:09.330 --> 00:38:11.510
What do you mean?

00:38:13.990 --> 00:38:15.590
After all, Fu Sheng

00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:17.970
is a person under my jurisdiction.

00:38:18.370 --> 00:38:21.780
And the murderer of physicians has not been found yet.

00:38:21.980 --> 00:38:24.000
I think it's not the right time

00:38:24.330 --> 00:38:25.890
to let him leave.

00:38:26.740 --> 00:38:28.690
You mean that

00:38:28.930 --> 00:38:30.270
the mansion needs to report to you

00:38:30.410 --> 00:38:32.210
when carrying out missions?

00:38:34.890 --> 00:38:36.140
Let me tell you.

00:38:36.140 --> 00:38:38.300
No matter what his autopsy says,

00:38:38.860 --> 00:38:40.780
I'm taking him away.

00:38:41.540 --> 00:38:42.350
Yes.

00:38:43.140 --> 00:38:45.140
I shouldn't say that.

00:38:47.290 --> 00:38:48.090
Sir.

00:38:49.140 --> 00:38:50.940
She has not woken up since giving birth.

00:38:50.940 --> 00:38:52.290
Her body is burning hot.

00:38:52.690 --> 00:38:54.700
Didn't Fu Sheng prescribe her medicine?

00:38:55.080 --> 00:38:56.020
Ask someone to get it

00:38:56.280 --> 00:38:58.280
and bring it back for her to drink.

00:38:58.630 --> 00:38:59.520
Yes.

00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:03.790
Mr. Ruan.

00:39:04.060 --> 00:39:04.930
Sorry.

00:39:05.020 --> 00:39:07.110
She disturbed our fun.

00:39:07.110 --> 00:39:07.680
Here.

00:39:07.830 --> 00:39:08.680
Let's drink.

00:39:16.550 --> 00:39:17.550
I heard you are quite good

00:39:18.070 --> 00:39:19.630
at being an official.

00:39:32.710 --> 00:39:34.820
I've carried it with me since I was a child.

00:39:35.250 --> 00:39:37.210
What's so special about it?

00:39:48.600 --> 00:39:50.590
My father always had this book in his hand before,

00:39:50.870 --> 00:39:53.270
but it ended up in Zhao Sihu's hands.

00:39:54.030 --> 00:39:55.880
Could the secret be in this book?

00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:02.530
But the medicinal materials in the book

00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:04.640
are all incompatible with each other,

00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:07.640
and even the order of performing the treatment is wrong.

00:40:11.130 --> 00:40:12.630
But my father's skills were good.

00:40:12.630 --> 00:40:14.730
He wouldn't make such small mistakes.

00:40:18.380 --> 00:40:20.400
Is there another mystery?

00:40:23.490 --> 00:40:25.450
Dark ink, strong smell.

00:40:25.770 --> 00:40:27.730
These comments are new.

00:40:46.570 --> 00:40:47.530
I didn't realize there were people

00:40:49.290 --> 00:40:50.680
you could amass so much wealth

00:40:53.530 --> 00:40:55.880
in this small place.

00:40:56.290 --> 00:40:58.160
Sir, I know I was wrong.

00:40:58.320 --> 00:40:59.840
I'm sorry.

00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:01.250
What's your fault?

00:41:02.050 --> 00:41:03.530
I admire your ability

00:41:04.920 --> 00:41:06.600
to amass wealth.

00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:09.970
I wonder if Mr. Yang

00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:13.120
would be willing to be my friend.

00:41:15.730 --> 00:41:17.730
I... I couldn't ask for more.

00:41:17.730 --> 00:41:18.920
Couldn't ask for more.

00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:20.290
Here.

00:41:20.290 --> 00:41:22.360
Sir, take a seat.

00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:24.530
I told you that you're good at this.

00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:25.680
Sir.

00:41:29.250 --> 00:41:30.160
Have some tea, please.

00:41:33.490 --> 00:41:34.530
After drinking the tea,

00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:37.810
then the gift...

00:41:37.810 --> 00:41:39.050
It's all yours.

00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:40.320
It's all yours.

00:41:44.570 --> 00:41:45.360
You're a good man.

00:42:05.150 --> 00:42:06.810
If you cut off my source of wealth,

00:42:07.580 --> 00:42:09.590
I will cut off your life.

00:42:17.690 --> 00:42:18.830
Here,

00:42:19.530 --> 00:42:20.920
I'm the king.

00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:24.120
You dare to threaten me?

00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:27.160
Die.

00:42:29.770 --> 00:42:31.790
Sir, Sir, Sir!

00:42:31.900 --> 00:42:33.210
What's the rush?

00:42:33.210 --> 00:42:35.100
Sir, your lady is dying.

00:42:35.130 --> 00:42:36.050
She's dying now.

00:42:36.510 --> 00:42:37.050
Let's go.

00:42:40.330 --> 00:42:41.130
My lady.

00:42:41.530 --> 00:42:42.100
My lady!

00:42:43.140 --> 00:42:44.530
My lady.

00:42:44.810 --> 00:42:45.650
Madam.

00:42:46.330 --> 00:42:48.920
Is Fu Sheng's prescription not working?

00:42:48.950 --> 00:42:50.400
At first I thought

00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:51.760
she had caught a cold,

00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:53.740
but she kept having a high fever.

00:42:54.100 --> 00:42:56.130
When I wiped her body,

00:42:56.330 --> 00:42:58.090
I found that pus and blood were oozing from the place

00:42:58.090 --> 00:42:59.290
where Crazy Fu had operated on her.

00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:00.210
I began to think

00:43:00.230 --> 00:43:01.850
maybe this ties back to Crazy Fu?

00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:06.940
You Crazy Fu.

00:43:08.110 --> 00:43:10.170
I have been kind to you,

00:43:11.190 --> 00:43:13.260
but you want to murder my wife.

00:43:14.670 --> 00:43:16.490
If that is the case,

00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:22.170
don't blame me for being strange.

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:39.570
Help! Someone is killed!

00:43:40.110 --> 00:43:40.780
Let's save them.
