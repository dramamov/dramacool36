Did you sleep well?

00:02:13.047 --> 00:02:14.807
I haven't slept this soundly in ages.

00:02:16.726 --> 00:02:18.166
Ever tried Braised Veal's breakfast?

00:02:18.166 --> 00:02:19.446
Their rice noodles are amazing.

00:02:20.767 --> 00:02:21.446
Let's go.

00:02:21.487 --> 00:02:22.087
Let's go.

00:02:32.446 --> 00:02:33.886
Ms. Lin. Happy New Year.

00:02:34.686 --> 00:02:35.566
Where are you?

00:02:37.886 --> 00:02:40.886
I celebrated New Year's Eve
with some buddies yesterday.

00:02:40.886 --> 00:02:41.807
We partied all night.

00:02:42.686 --> 00:02:43.886
Almost back?

00:02:46.327 --> 00:02:47.006
Yes.

00:02:47.606 --> 00:02:48.446
Perfect.

00:02:49.247 --> 00:02:50.406
Let's have breakfast.

00:02:50.726 --> 00:02:51.527
Sure.

00:02:51.807 --> 00:02:52.606
See you later.

00:02:59.166 --> 00:03:00.166
I'm sorry.

00:03:00.166 --> 00:03:01.126
I need to go.

00:03:04.166 --> 00:03:04.967
Stay in touch.

00:03:04.967 --> 00:03:05.527
Okay.

00:03:08.606 --> 00:03:09.367
Be careful.

00:04:04.367 --> 00:04:05.006
I'm off.

00:04:27.386 --> 00:04:28.712
(Shutting down)

00:04:39.087 --> 00:04:39.687
Mr. Yan,

00:04:39.926 --> 00:04:41.046
Ms. Lin wants to see you.

00:04:43.087 --> 00:04:44.486
Alright. Let me park my car first

00:04:44.486 --> 00:04:45.007
before going.

00:04:45.087 --> 00:04:46.286
Xiong orders us

00:04:46.767 --> 00:04:48.087
to take you straight to Ms. Lin.

00:04:48.166 --> 00:04:49.647
I'll park the car for you.

00:04:51.846 --> 00:04:52.606
Okay.

00:04:56.967 --> 00:04:57.726
Thanks.

00:05:15.087 --> 00:05:16.207
After you, Mr. Yan.

00:05:31.926 --> 00:05:32.687
Ms. Lin.

00:05:37.486 --> 00:05:38.286
What's wrong, Xiong?

00:05:44.447 --> 00:05:45.687
Wait, what are you doing?

00:05:45.767 --> 00:05:46.926
Wait, wait.

00:05:50.687 --> 00:05:51.606
What are you doing?

00:05:53.046 --> 00:05:53.840
Where's your phone?

00:05:54.246 --> 00:05:55.246
My phone?

00:05:55.246 --> 00:05:56.527
My phone...

00:05:58.647 --> 00:06:01.286
I left it in the car.
Have Peng check the car.

00:06:07.606 --> 00:06:09.606
You came prepared, huh?

00:06:11.726 --> 00:06:12.767
What do you mean, Ms. Lin?

00:06:16.767 --> 00:06:18.207
How long have you lied to me?

00:06:20.327 --> 00:06:21.447
What did I lie about?

Let me explain, please?

00:06:32.806 --> 00:06:33.806
Back then, I just...

00:06:43.926 --> 00:06:44.406
Forget it.

00:06:48.127 --> 00:06:48.806
Ms. Lin.

00:06:51.127 --> 00:06:52.926
Ms. Lin gave you many chances.

00:06:53.246 --> 00:06:55.447
You threw away a good life.

00:06:56.846 --> 00:06:57.887
No, Ms. Lin. I really...

00:06:57.887 --> 00:06:59.166
Move!

00:06:59.246 --> 00:07:00.527
Wait, Ms. Lin.

00:07:17.726 --> 00:07:19.486

All the common microorganisms in soil

00:07:40.806 --> 00:07:42.327
are not present.

00:07:43.207 --> 00:07:44.527
Such sterile soil?

00:07:47.887 --> 00:07:51.406
Only one substance.

00:07:52.127 --> 00:07:52.806
What?

00:07:54.486 --> 00:07:56.846
Not sure.

00:07:56.846 --> 00:07:58.887
I have never seen it.

00:07:58.887 --> 00:08:00.926
No records are found.

00:08:00.926 --> 00:08:08.606
It seems to have consumed
all other organisms.

00:08:09.406 --> 00:08:10.527
Consumed them?

00:08:14.606 --> 00:08:16.127
Not exactly.

00:08:17.207 --> 00:08:21.846
They merged into one entity.

00:08:29.366 --> 00:08:29.967
By the way,

00:08:30.687 --> 00:08:32.526
I found this at Lin Xirou's hideout.

00:08:33.047 --> 00:08:34.246
Looking like soil, it ignites

00:08:34.726 --> 00:08:35.846
upon contact with fire.

00:08:37.807 --> 00:08:39.927
It feels like rich butter

00:08:42.167 --> 00:08:44.006
and glows by night.

00:08:45.846 --> 00:08:47.886
Resembling hounds and rabbits,

00:08:49.526 --> 00:08:51.526
yet neither hounds nor rabbits.

00:08:59.327 --> 00:09:00.927
Could this be

00:09:03.967 --> 00:09:04.927
Yuwang Meat?

00:09:05.366 --> 00:09:08.087
When Yuwang Meat is mixed into soil,

00:09:08.087 --> 00:09:10.047
that is Turquoise Land.

00:09:26.967 --> 00:09:27.687
Both of you, out.

00:09:42.126 --> 00:09:43.287
Must you make such a scene?

00:09:44.486 --> 00:09:45.567
I'm not making a scene.

00:09:45.967 --> 00:09:47.087
You guys are making a scene.

00:09:49.526 --> 00:09:51.126
Ms. Lin won't hear your explanation.

00:09:51.486 --> 00:09:52.207
I'll hear it.

00:09:57.967 --> 00:09:58.687
Fine.

00:10:04.246 --> 00:10:05.967
Do you really like Vi-Yu Girls?

00:10:07.766 --> 00:10:08.366
What?

00:10:08.486 --> 00:10:10.126
That's just a skin
you're wearing, right?

00:10:12.886 --> 00:10:15.287
Adopting the shallowest, readiest,

00:10:15.927 --> 00:10:17.246
most relatable persona

00:10:17.246 --> 00:10:18.486
as your own

00:10:19.366 --> 00:10:20.486
is quite clever.

00:10:22.207 --> 00:10:23.726
But humans are too complicated.

00:10:24.766 --> 00:10:26.047
To imitate convincingly

00:10:26.726 --> 00:10:27.407
is tough.

00:10:29.567 --> 00:10:30.287
Complicated?

00:10:31.846 --> 00:10:34.087
Why do I find humans simple?

00:10:35.327 --> 00:10:36.927
Simple to the point of stupidity.

00:10:37.486 --> 00:10:39.606
So stupid that
they can't recognize generosity

00:10:40.167 --> 00:10:42.687
or distinguish enemies from family.

00:10:46.646 --> 00:10:47.246
True.

00:10:48.606 --> 00:10:51.766
But humans know truth from lies.

00:10:53.047 --> 00:10:54.886
They know their real enemies

00:10:54.886 --> 00:10:56.167
and fake family.

00:10:57.207 --> 00:10:58.447
If you want to be human,

00:10:59.087 --> 00:11:00.407
drop the fake compassion.

00:11:12.126 --> 00:11:13.447
Come on!

00:11:24.447 --> 00:11:27.287
He just hid a madwoman's diary?

00:11:28.047 --> 00:11:28.807
What's the fuss?

00:11:32.807 --> 00:11:34.886
The diary writer was mad,

00:11:36.006 --> 00:11:37.606
but Yan Tuo isn't.

00:11:38.726 --> 00:11:40.087
If he had nothing to hide,

00:11:40.726 --> 00:11:42.126
why hide it so well?

00:11:43.047 --> 00:11:44.207
Young men

00:11:44.207 --> 00:11:45.447
all have secrets.

00:11:45.766 --> 00:11:48.126
Telling Mom every detail

00:11:48.126 --> 00:11:49.407
leaves no space.

00:11:49.486 --> 00:11:50.567
How can they excel?

00:11:53.047 --> 00:11:54.726
Whether there'll even be a future

00:11:56.407 --> 00:11:58.047
is hard to say now.

00:12:09.207 --> 00:12:10.246
It's time.

00:12:11.646 --> 00:12:13.486
We should return.

00:12:17.047 --> 00:12:17.886
Return?

00:12:51.766 --> 00:12:53.327
Sorry, Tuo.

00:12:53.606 --> 00:12:55.687
Xiong forbids our contact with you.

00:12:56.167 --> 00:12:57.726
Don't make it difficult for us.

00:13:44.486 --> 00:13:46.366
(Where are you?)

00:14:10.927 --> 00:14:13.927
(What happened?
Why aren't you responding?)

Excluding the disabled and dead,

00:14:49.567 --> 00:14:50.766
and those untouchables

00:14:50.766 --> 00:14:52.447
near Lin Xirou,

00:14:53.047 --> 00:14:55.087
we have four humanoid Earth Fiends

00:14:55.886 --> 00:14:57.366
as viable targets.

00:14:59.726 --> 00:15:01.526
I've checked their files

00:15:02.287 --> 00:15:04.287
and sent people
to investigate their lives.

00:15:08.656 --> 00:15:10.416
(Shen Lizhu, Yudong City)

00:15:10.646 --> 00:15:11.927
Earth Fiend Shen Lizhu

00:15:14.207 --> 00:15:15.927
(Shen Lizhu)
runs a snack shop in Yudong.

00:15:16.807 --> 00:15:19.126
She lives with foster sister Yu Caiyan.

00:15:19.567 --> 00:15:20.646
Yu Caiyan

00:15:20.646 --> 00:15:22.726
(Yu Caiyan)
is Shen Lizhu's second-gen blood bag.

00:15:23.366 --> 00:15:25.287
Yu Caiyan has a daughter, Qian,

00:15:25.447 --> 00:15:27.486
(Lu Yuqian)
the third-gen blood bag for Shen Lizhu.

00:15:28.246 --> 00:15:29.687
Shen Lizhu is physically strong.

00:15:30.287 --> 00:15:31.486
I'll capture her myself.

00:15:31.728 --> 00:15:33.006
(Zheng Liang, Guigu City)

00:15:33.006 --> 00:15:34.126
Earth Fiend Zheng Liang

00:15:34.927 --> 00:15:36.766
(Zheng Liang)
works in veggie logistics in Guigu.

00:15:38.087 --> 00:15:40.126
He lives with porter Zhou Cheng,

00:15:41.006 --> 00:15:43.526
(Zhou Cheng)
his second-gen blood bag.

00:15:44.126 --> 00:15:45.486
Zheng Liang is vigorous.

00:15:46.207 --> 00:15:48.407
Let's have Big Head handle him.

00:15:49.526 --> 00:15:50.126
Okay.

00:15:51.846 --> 00:15:52.886
(Wei Jiao, Jinyu City)
Earth Fiend Wei Jiao

00:15:53.246 --> 00:15:55.927
(Wei Jiao)
teaches art at a training institution.

00:15:56.287 --> 00:15:58.486
She cares deeply for student Meng Tong.

00:15:58.846 --> 00:15:59.766
Initial deduction:

00:16:00.047 --> 00:16:01.126
Meng Tong's mother

00:16:01.126 --> 00:16:02.846
was Wei Jiao's first-gen blood bag

00:16:02.846 --> 00:16:03.967
and was killed.

00:16:04.167 --> 00:16:05.366
Meng Tong is

00:16:05.726 --> 00:16:08.486
(Meng Tong)
her planned second-gen replacement.

00:16:09.126 --> 00:16:10.567
Since Wei Jiao is a teacher,

00:16:10.967 --> 00:16:12.606
to avoid harming students,

00:16:12.967 --> 00:16:15.526
we'll let conscientious Shan Qiang
handle her.

00:16:20.927 --> 00:16:22.246
Earth Fiend Zhu Changyi

00:16:22.246 --> 00:16:22.800
(Zhu Changyi, Huihu City)

00:16:23.687 --> 00:16:26.006
(Available)
is a taxi driver in Huihu City.

00:16:26.287 --> 00:16:28.927
He adopted orphan Cheng Xiaotao
as a foster son.

00:16:29.567 --> 00:16:32.447
(Cheng Xiaotao)
Cheng is his second-gen blood bag.

00:16:32.846 --> 00:16:35.567
Zhu's cunning and resourceful.

00:16:35.807 --> 00:16:37.486
(Driver: Zhu Changyi, Cheng Xiaotao)
To lower his guard,

00:16:38.087 --> 00:16:39.766
Yu Rong and Quecha will handle him.

00:16:43.126 --> 00:16:44.287
Sneaky.

00:16:45.006 --> 00:16:47.287
Smart to spread their eggs.

00:16:48.006 --> 00:16:49.126
Very scattered.

00:16:49.264 --> 00:16:50.246
(What happened?
Why aren't you responding?)

00:16:50.246 --> 00:16:51.447
Same for us.

00:16:52.207 --> 00:16:53.486
Just wipe them all out.

00:16:56.766 --> 00:16:57.606
No problem.

00:16:58.486 --> 00:16:59.246
I'm here.

00:17:00.967 --> 00:17:02.207
This isn't like before.

00:17:02.287 --> 00:17:04.046
Prey aren't in forests

00:17:04.046 --> 00:17:05.607
but in cities.

00:17:05.726 --> 00:17:07.847
So we need to stay covert

00:17:07.967 --> 00:17:08.927
and strike fast

00:17:09.246 --> 00:17:10.766
to avoid panic

00:17:11.566 --> 00:17:12.766
and protect civilians.

00:17:13.127 --> 00:17:13.806
Right.

00:17:14.127 --> 00:17:15.726
Though scattered,

00:17:15.766 --> 00:17:17.526
all operations must be synchronized.

00:17:17.566 --> 00:17:19.127
Don't let them exploit delays

00:17:19.127 --> 00:17:20.006
to warn each other.

00:17:20.526 --> 00:17:20.887
Remember.

00:17:21.687 --> 00:17:23.806
They are fiends. We are humans.

00:17:24.647 --> 00:17:27.367
Don't harbor doubts
just because of their human skin.

00:17:28.127 --> 00:17:29.326
Once we confront them head-on,

00:17:29.647 --> 00:17:31.167
it's either they die or we die.

00:17:31.766 --> 00:17:34.447
They've hidden themselves
almost flawlessly.

00:17:34.887 --> 00:17:36.367
So we can't afford any mistakes.

00:17:36.927 --> 00:17:38.286
If we let even one escape,

00:17:38.647 --> 00:17:39.326
it will make

00:17:39.766 --> 00:17:41.407
finding them quite difficult.

00:17:41.806 --> 00:17:43.806
Blood bag Lin Ling
must be rescued simultaneously.

00:17:43.967 --> 00:17:44.967
I'll handle that.

00:17:45.847 --> 00:17:48.726
It's time again for us Hunters
to show our true skills

00:17:49.207 --> 00:17:51.726
and fulfill our thousand-year-old duty.

00:17:52.806 --> 00:17:53.607
Everyone,

00:17:54.046 --> 00:17:54.927
get ready

00:17:55.167 --> 00:17:56.127
to strike at any moment.

00:17:56.246 --> 00:17:58.726
- Got it.
- Got it.

00:17:59.184 --> 00:18:01.826
(Meeting concluded)

00:18:10.132 --> 00:18:11.318
(Yan Tuo)

00:18:19.556 --> 00:18:21.106
(Yan Tuo)

00:18:27.447 --> 00:18:28.006
(Sorry.)

00:18:28.566 --> 00:18:30.407
(The subscriber you dialed
is powered off.)

00:18:54.847 --> 00:18:55.607
Tuo.

00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:16.560
(Yan Tuo)

00:20:18.486 --> 00:20:21.806
(Hello. The subscriber you dialed
is powered off.)

00:20:37.008 --> 00:20:38.904
(Xing Shen)

00:20:46.766 --> 00:20:47.607
He's gone dark?

00:20:50.127 --> 00:20:50.766
Yes.

00:20:51.806 --> 00:20:53.407
I parted ways with him this morning,

00:20:53.607 --> 00:20:55.326
and there's been no contact since.

00:20:57.607 --> 00:20:59.046
We just finalized

00:20:59.046 --> 00:21:00.887
the plan to capture
those four Earth Fiends.

00:21:02.526 --> 00:21:04.927
If something goes wrong now,

00:21:06.607 --> 00:21:08.006
I'll have to call it off.

00:21:08.486 --> 00:21:09.967
If you mean

00:21:10.407 --> 00:21:12.326
he broke his word
or had ulterior motives,

00:21:12.407 --> 00:21:13.447
you can rest assured.

00:21:13.927 --> 00:21:15.526
I'm worried about him being exposed

00:21:15.526 --> 00:21:17.046
and discovered by Lin Xirou.

00:21:17.207 --> 00:21:18.927
No matter what happens,

00:21:19.566 --> 00:21:21.127
we must not take risks.

00:21:22.726 --> 00:21:24.647
Any new updates
from the surveillance team?

00:21:25.447 --> 00:21:26.167
Nothing so far.

00:21:26.246 --> 00:21:27.566
Then there's no issue.

00:21:27.847 --> 00:21:29.046
If the plan gets leaked,

00:21:29.046 --> 00:21:30.326
Lin Xirou will immediately

00:21:30.326 --> 00:21:31.486
move those four Earth Fiends.

00:21:32.326 --> 00:21:33.046
Luo,

00:21:34.847 --> 00:21:36.687
don't you think your trust in Yan Tuo

00:21:38.447 --> 00:21:40.046
is a bit excessive?

00:21:43.967 --> 00:21:45.006
I know what I'm doing.

00:21:46.526 --> 00:21:47.286
Stick to the plan.

00:21:55.504 --> 00:21:57.326
(Wanbao Tower)

00:21:57.326 --> 00:21:58.127
Thank you then.

00:21:58.687 --> 00:21:59.847
Drop by later for herbal tea.

00:21:59.847 --> 00:22:00.486
Got it.

00:22:00.486 --> 00:22:01.207
I'm leaving.

00:22:01.246 --> 00:22:02.046
Take care, Lv.

00:22:09.286 --> 00:22:10.207
You are...

00:22:12.887 --> 00:22:13.566
Miss Nie?

00:22:15.167 --> 00:22:15.847
Sorry to intrude.

00:22:24.207 --> 00:22:25.806
How's your injury recovering?

00:22:26.046 --> 00:22:27.246
Need a dressing change?

00:22:32.246 --> 00:22:33.006
Stop looking.

00:22:33.407 --> 00:22:34.447
No one else is here.

00:22:34.847 --> 00:22:35.607
This is good.

00:22:35.607 --> 00:22:36.286
Take it.

00:22:39.086 --> 00:22:39.967
Yan Tuo is missing.

00:22:41.407 --> 00:22:42.286
Missing?

00:22:43.607 --> 00:22:44.367
He told me

00:22:44.967 --> 00:22:46.207
that if I couldn't reach him,

00:22:46.207 --> 00:22:47.167
I should come find you.

00:22:47.407 --> 00:22:48.566
After all, you're the closest

00:22:48.566 --> 00:22:50.246
to Roadsound Group besides him.

00:22:50.407 --> 00:22:51.967
You might have some leads.

00:22:53.967 --> 00:22:54.927
That's fair.

00:22:56.207 --> 00:22:57.326
But I don't have any leads.

00:23:03.006 --> 00:23:04.006
We also planned

00:23:04.127 --> 00:23:06.246
to rescue Lin Ling
from Lin Xirou's control.

00:23:06.887 --> 00:23:07.806
You can approach her.

00:23:08.207 --> 00:23:10.447
Can you investigate
Yan Tuo's whereabouts

00:23:10.447 --> 00:23:11.486
while also

00:23:11.486 --> 00:23:12.566
working on that mission?

00:23:15.246 --> 00:23:16.806
You're asking for my help, right?

00:23:17.367 --> 00:23:19.286
Why does this
feel like receiving orders?

00:23:20.046 --> 00:23:20.566
Wait.

00:23:20.766 --> 00:23:22.647
Leaving aside
whether I can complete the tasks,

00:23:23.526 --> 00:23:25.526
how can you be sure we're allies?

00:23:27.806 --> 00:23:28.766
Yan Tuo trusts you.

00:23:29.207 --> 00:23:29.967
So do I.

00:23:32.607 --> 00:23:33.326
No time to waste.

00:23:33.526 --> 00:23:34.246
Let's move.

00:23:37.167 --> 00:23:39.647
Yan Tuo sure knows
how to order people around.

00:23:39.806 --> 00:23:41.286
And you're not far behind him.

00:23:45.246 --> 00:23:46.286
Here's my number.

00:23:46.647 --> 00:23:47.887
If anything new comes up,

00:23:48.006 --> 00:23:49.127
make sure to contact me.

00:24:17.847 --> 00:24:18.927
Xiong wants to know

00:24:19.167 --> 00:24:21.127
if you've remembered anything
worth reporting.

00:26:20.367 --> 00:26:21.486
How is he now?

00:26:22.207 --> 00:26:23.167
Very obedient,

00:26:23.367 --> 00:26:24.326
sitting around all day.

00:26:28.286 --> 00:26:29.687
Have you found his phone?

00:26:30.726 --> 00:26:31.447
Not yet.

00:26:32.286 --> 00:26:33.967
I've also asked all the clients

00:26:33.967 --> 00:26:35.006
he has recently contacted.

00:26:35.486 --> 00:26:36.486
Nothing unusual.

00:26:39.207 --> 00:26:41.167
Such calmness

00:26:41.167 --> 00:26:42.367
is unusual.

00:26:46.726 --> 00:26:49.086
Would you like to ask him yourself?

00:26:54.927 --> 00:26:56.086
Not for now.

00:27:37.927 --> 00:27:38.647
Ms. Lin,

00:27:40.086 --> 00:27:41.086
why haven't I

00:27:41.887 --> 00:27:43.806
seen my brother lately?

00:27:45.167 --> 00:27:46.006
Need anything?

00:27:47.847 --> 00:27:48.647
No.

00:27:49.006 --> 00:27:49.927
It's just that

00:27:50.566 --> 00:27:54.046
I texted and called him,

00:27:54.246 --> 00:27:55.407
but he hasn't responded.

00:27:58.246 --> 00:27:59.046
He's sick.

00:27:59.726 --> 00:28:01.607
I told him to rest at home.

00:28:02.006 --> 00:28:03.447
He won't be going out recently.

00:28:04.447 --> 00:28:05.246
He's sick?

00:28:06.006 --> 00:28:07.526
Then I'll visit him later.

00:28:09.486 --> 00:28:11.246
He's got a contagious disease.

00:28:12.046 --> 00:28:13.607
What kind of contagious disease?

00:28:18.967 --> 00:28:22.127
The kind you absolutely mustn't catch.

00:28:26.687 --> 00:28:27.887
Is it serious?

00:28:29.566 --> 00:28:30.887
I'm going on a business trip.

00:28:31.127 --> 00:28:32.286
Until I return,

00:28:32.286 --> 00:28:33.447
don't leave this place

00:28:33.847 --> 00:28:35.167
or visit him.

00:28:40.367 --> 00:28:41.566
Ms. Lin, Dr. Lv is here.

00:28:41.607 --> 00:28:42.127
Ms. Lin,

00:28:42.607 --> 00:28:43.967
look what I brought you.

00:28:46.207 --> 00:28:47.887
I went through a lot of trouble

00:28:48.127 --> 00:28:49.806
to get this premium
blood-red bird's nest.

00:28:52.286 --> 00:28:52.806
Oh no.

00:28:53.566 --> 00:28:54.367
Oh no.

00:28:55.167 --> 00:28:56.766
I thought with winter coming,

00:28:56.887 --> 00:28:58.246
you'd need a blood tonic.

00:28:58.607 --> 00:28:59.687
But seeing you now,

00:28:59.847 --> 00:29:01.847
you're the healthiest one here.

00:29:02.167 --> 00:29:03.326
Better not overdo it.

00:29:04.447 --> 00:29:05.566
I'll give it to Lin Ling.

00:29:07.967 --> 00:29:08.647
You chat.

00:29:16.647 --> 00:29:17.927
Ms. Lin, I was joking.

00:29:18.927 --> 00:29:20.407
Since I brought it, have a taste.

00:29:22.847 --> 00:29:25.207
Did I say something wrong?

00:29:40.086 --> 00:29:41.167
It's the holidays.

00:29:42.006 --> 00:29:43.127
Wanbao Tower is hectic.

00:29:44.127 --> 00:29:45.607
I haven't had time to check on you.

00:29:46.286 --> 00:29:46.967
How are you?

00:29:49.326 --> 00:29:50.127
I'm fine.

00:29:51.927 --> 00:29:52.566
Really?

00:29:53.847 --> 00:29:56.246
You look like you haven't slept.

00:29:56.766 --> 00:29:57.766
Let me check your pulse.

00:29:59.847 --> 00:30:00.647
Come on.

00:30:08.806 --> 00:30:09.766
Let me see

00:30:12.086 --> 00:30:13.726
what's really going on.

00:30:24.526 --> 00:30:25.486
(I can't reach Tuo.)

00:30:25.486 --> 00:30:26.887
(Ms. Lin said he's sick
and is resting at home.)

00:30:26.887 --> 00:30:27.887
(He can't go out.)

00:30:28.246 --> 00:30:29.367
Heat causes insomnia.

00:30:32.447 --> 00:30:34.326
(Pure nonsense.)

00:30:34.486 --> 00:30:35.006
Then

00:30:37.967 --> 00:30:39.127
what should I do?

00:30:39.407 --> 00:30:40.127
Don't panic.

00:30:40.486 --> 00:30:41.766
Let me check again.

00:30:42.687 --> 00:30:44.607
You need to be careful.

00:30:45.367 --> 00:30:46.847
Stay calm

00:30:47.526 --> 00:30:49.726
and don't overreact.

00:30:50.687 --> 00:30:52.806
(As long as he's home, he's safe.)

00:30:52.806 --> 00:30:53.967
(Be ready.)

00:30:53.967 --> 00:30:55.766
(I'll get you out of here soon.)

00:30:57.167 --> 00:30:58.326
Liver qi imbalance too?

00:30:59.927 --> 00:31:01.486
Stop getting angry at games.

00:31:02.607 --> 00:31:03.486
Just take the losses.

00:31:04.006 --> 00:31:05.887
Don't play anymore. So what?

00:31:07.326 --> 00:31:08.486
(Ms. Lin leaves next week.)

00:31:08.486 --> 00:31:09.566
(She's grounded me.)

00:31:09.566 --> 00:31:10.246
Next week.

00:31:14.447 --> 00:31:17.326
When I bring Ms. Lin
her medicine next week,

00:31:18.086 --> 00:31:20.286
I'll brew some for you too

00:31:20.286 --> 00:31:21.046
and bring it over.

00:31:23.086 --> 00:31:24.207
Are you sure

00:31:25.806 --> 00:31:26.927
I'm okay?

00:31:27.207 --> 00:31:28.526
(What about my brother?)

00:31:28.526 --> 00:31:29.967
Don't you trust me?

00:31:30.967 --> 00:31:32.486
Even if I can't help,

00:31:33.647 --> 00:31:35.967
there are others more capable.

00:31:37.367 --> 00:31:38.167
We have resources.

00:31:39.647 --> 00:31:40.286
Enough.

00:31:40.847 --> 00:31:41.687
Don't dwell on it.

00:31:42.407 --> 00:31:43.246
You're fine.

00:31:45.086 --> 00:31:47.766
What did I say to upset her earlier?

00:31:48.447 --> 00:31:49.286
She barely ate.

00:31:49.566 --> 00:31:50.726
Let me take over.

00:31:52.407 --> 00:31:53.766
Have my portion.

00:31:54.127 --> 00:31:55.046
I haven't touched it.

00:31:55.647 --> 00:31:56.326
Alright.

00:31:57.006 --> 00:31:57.766
Listen.

00:31:58.046 --> 00:31:59.847
Eat well, sleep well,
and build your strength.

00:31:59.847 --> 00:32:00.766
That matters most.

00:32:13.806 --> 00:32:14.647
Found anything?

00:32:15.887 --> 00:32:16.887
Lin Ling says

00:32:16.927 --> 00:32:19.167
Yan Tuo has been confined
by Lin Xirou at his own home.

00:32:19.566 --> 00:32:20.607
Lin Xirou?

00:32:21.286 --> 00:32:22.246
Why would she do that?

00:32:23.687 --> 00:32:25.286
Great question. How would I know?

00:32:25.407 --> 00:32:26.167
Dr. Lv.

00:32:28.407 --> 00:32:29.006
Bro.

00:32:29.326 --> 00:32:29.927
The medication.

00:32:31.046 --> 00:32:32.127
I completely forgot.

00:32:32.326 --> 00:32:33.086
Wait.

00:32:34.127 --> 00:32:34.967
You wait too.

00:32:35.006 --> 00:32:35.687
A customer.

00:32:44.887 --> 00:32:45.766
Where were we?

00:32:46.566 --> 00:32:47.726
Yan Tuo told me

00:32:48.447 --> 00:32:49.967
Lin Xirou has a steady personality.

00:32:50.167 --> 00:32:51.486
She doesn't make rash decisions.

00:32:52.326 --> 00:32:53.647
The last time I contacted him

00:32:53.687 --> 00:32:55.086
was at 9 AM on the 1st.

00:32:55.486 --> 00:32:56.726
It's been less than three days.

00:32:57.447 --> 00:32:59.566
If he's just confined at home,

00:33:00.326 --> 00:33:01.407
room to maneuver remains.

00:33:03.246 --> 00:33:04.286
What's your plan?

00:33:04.967 --> 00:33:06.726
Enter the tiger's den to catch the cub?

00:33:08.046 --> 00:33:08.967
How's Lin Ling?

00:33:11.326 --> 00:33:12.847
She's being closely watched.

00:33:13.806 --> 00:33:16.006
We couldn't have proper conversations.

00:33:16.847 --> 00:33:17.687
But she mentioned

00:33:17.806 --> 00:33:19.967
Lin Xirou might take a trip next week.

00:33:20.486 --> 00:33:22.766
I don't know the exact timing.

00:33:24.207 --> 00:33:25.407
This could be an opportunity.

00:33:26.766 --> 00:33:27.687
If possible,

00:33:27.766 --> 00:33:29.006
try to bring Lin Ling out.

00:33:29.647 --> 00:33:31.167
It'll be easier to act outside.

00:33:33.286 --> 00:33:34.486
That's too difficult.

00:33:35.326 --> 00:33:37.286
This requires
both entering the tiger's den

00:33:37.927 --> 00:33:39.607
and luring the snake out of its hole.

00:33:39.847 --> 00:33:41.486
It leaves me stuck between choices.

00:33:42.726 --> 00:33:43.566
Regardless,

00:33:44.207 --> 00:33:45.847
first coordinate plans with Lin Ling.

00:33:46.607 --> 00:33:47.687
She's crucial now.

00:33:52.927 --> 00:33:53.967
No one will die.

00:33:54.566 --> 00:33:56.127
No, it's not about our business.

00:33:56.806 --> 00:33:57.407
Got it.

00:33:57.607 --> 00:33:58.526
Then I'll

00:33:59.566 --> 00:34:02.326
try to contact her however possible.

00:34:04.326 --> 00:34:04.967
I need to go.

00:34:16.206 --> 00:34:17.046
Bro, it's ready.

00:34:20.927 --> 00:34:21.646
Well,

00:34:22.247 --> 00:34:25.646
hearing you talk
about tigers and snakes,

00:34:25.686 --> 00:34:27.166
did you get some potent medicine?

00:34:27.606 --> 00:34:29.287
That medicine is too strong for you.

00:34:31.646 --> 00:34:33.006
Give me a smaller dose.

00:34:33.247 --> 00:34:34.086
Let me try it.

00:34:34.407 --> 00:34:36.006
You? Get through this first.

00:34:36.327 --> 00:34:37.247
Don't mess around.

00:34:46.486 --> 00:34:48.126
I might not handle it either.

00:34:52.592 --> 00:34:57.776
(Nanshan Rescue Team)

00:35:19.046 --> 00:35:20.767
Lin Xirou is taking a trip next week.

00:35:20.967 --> 00:35:22.486
It must be something critical.

00:35:24.126 --> 00:35:25.287
You mean that we

00:35:26.807 --> 00:35:27.847
strike while she's away?

00:35:29.486 --> 00:35:30.847
This is a rare opportunity.

00:35:31.206 --> 00:35:32.447
Any specific timing?

00:35:33.686 --> 00:35:34.807
Just know it's next week.

00:35:34.927 --> 00:35:36.046
The exact day is unclear.

00:35:37.006 --> 00:35:38.646
But we need to prepare quickly.

00:35:38.727 --> 00:35:40.606
Yan Tuo is confined
at home by Lin Xirou.

00:35:40.847 --> 00:35:42.807
We don't know how much she's discovered.

00:35:43.526 --> 00:35:45.006
You deal with the four Earth Fiends.

00:35:45.086 --> 00:35:46.327
I'll try to rescue him.

00:35:46.646 --> 00:35:47.327
Okay.

00:35:47.887 --> 00:35:49.887
I'll plan around next week.

00:35:50.967 --> 00:35:51.807
Await my signal.

00:36:02.086 --> 00:36:02.686
Earth Fiends

00:36:03.046 --> 00:36:03.847
fear light.

00:36:03.967 --> 00:36:05.686
On moonless new moon nights,

00:36:05.686 --> 00:36:07.967
Earth Fiends conduct crucial matters.

00:36:07.967 --> 00:36:10.086
Humans should stay extra vigilant then.

00:36:10.327 --> 00:36:11.046
Wait.

00:36:13.486 --> 00:36:14.367
What're you reciting?

00:36:16.807 --> 00:36:19.606
Annals of Ancient South Mountain.
Folklore Oddities Record.

00:36:19.686 --> 00:36:21.166
Turquoise Land Chronicles.

00:36:22.407 --> 00:36:23.247
Recite it again.

00:36:25.566 --> 00:36:27.367
Earth Fiends live long.

00:36:28.046 --> 00:36:30.606
Their aging, illness, death,
and pregnancy

00:36:30.606 --> 00:36:32.166
all take longer than...

00:36:32.166 --> 00:36:33.526
The line with a date.

00:36:36.566 --> 00:36:39.847
Line eight, page seven
of Turquoise Land Chronicles.

00:36:40.287 --> 00:36:43.126
Earth Fiends fear light, even moonlight.

00:36:43.447 --> 00:36:45.486
On moonless new moon nights,

00:36:45.486 --> 00:36:48.166
Earth Fiends conduct crucial matters.

00:36:48.327 --> 00:36:50.006
Humans should stay extra vigilant then.

00:36:51.526 --> 00:36:53.606
When's next month's new moon?

00:36:55.767 --> 00:37:00.206
Next Wednesday.

00:37:01.327 --> 00:37:02.327
Next week.

00:37:09.327 --> 00:37:11.407
Next time, have him come personally.

00:37:12.006 --> 00:37:14.247
At his age, no need for shyness.

00:37:14.967 --> 00:37:16.447
I'll check his pulse properly

00:37:16.646 --> 00:37:18.126
and adjust the medicine dosage.

00:37:18.166 --> 00:37:18.967
Don't you agree?

00:37:19.126 --> 00:37:20.046
Yes.

00:37:20.206 --> 00:37:22.086
It's common for middle-aged men.

00:37:22.206 --> 00:37:23.086
Let alone him.

00:37:23.247 --> 00:37:24.967
Even I just can't keep up at my age.

00:37:26.367 --> 00:37:28.126
We're all relying on medicine to get by.

00:37:29.327 --> 00:37:30.767
He's doing just fine like that.

00:37:31.086 --> 00:37:32.847
The main thing
is building up his confidence.

00:37:35.287 --> 00:37:36.287
Thank you, Dr. Lv.

00:37:37.407 --> 00:37:38.807
No problem.

00:37:42.367 --> 00:37:44.247
Being a man is tough.

00:37:44.927 --> 00:37:45.486
Oh my.

00:37:47.126 --> 00:37:48.046
When did you get here?

00:37:50.686 --> 00:37:52.887
Lin Xirou should be leaving
next Wednesday.

00:37:53.206 --> 00:37:54.407
The plan to rescue Lin Ling

00:37:54.407 --> 00:37:56.046
will be prepared according to that.

00:37:57.247 --> 00:37:57.927
Got it.

00:37:57.927 --> 00:37:59.606
Then I'll find a way to tell Lin Ling.

00:38:05.046 --> 00:38:06.206
Are you really ready?

00:38:09.206 --> 00:38:11.646
What counts as being ready?

00:38:12.686 --> 00:38:15.126
Having a clear plan
with everything in control?

00:38:22.367 --> 00:38:23.887
Last time you saved my life.

00:38:24.086 --> 00:38:25.447
I haven't thanked you yet.

00:38:25.686 --> 00:38:27.046
I'm having you take risks again.

00:38:27.327 --> 00:38:28.486
Wait, stop right there.

00:38:29.126 --> 00:38:30.526
I know about Lin Ling's situation.

00:38:31.247 --> 00:38:32.847
I see it and remember it.

00:38:33.206 --> 00:38:34.447
Saving her is my own choice,

00:38:34.447 --> 00:38:35.407
not your request.

00:38:37.526 --> 00:38:39.646
Besides, you and Yan Tuo
are probably the same.

00:38:40.126 --> 00:38:42.006
Whenever you formally thank me,

00:38:42.407 --> 00:38:44.166
there's always a trick waiting for me.

00:38:44.606 --> 00:38:45.927
I'm scared of being thanked now.

00:38:47.046 --> 00:38:48.247
I see through you couple

00:38:48.247 --> 00:38:49.447
and your ways completely.

00:38:54.006 --> 00:38:55.807
Don't help your buddy
take advantage of me.

00:38:58.126 --> 00:38:58.847
My mistake.

00:38:59.367 --> 00:39:01.046
Then consider me and him
the couple, okay?

00:39:02.807 --> 00:39:03.566
Since you're here,

00:39:03.847 --> 00:39:05.046
have some herbal tea.

00:39:05.166 --> 00:39:06.287
No. I have other business.

00:39:30.407 --> 00:39:32.206
No fiends in South Mountain.

00:39:32.646 --> 00:39:34.287
Peace for all living things.

00:39:34.447 --> 00:39:36.166
No fiends in South Mountain.

00:39:36.166 --> 00:39:37.887
Peace for all living things.

00:39:38.287 --> 00:39:39.847
(No fiends in South Mountain.)

00:39:40.006 --> 00:39:41.407
(Peace for all living things.)

00:39:42.206 --> 00:39:43.887
(No fiends in South Mountain.)

00:39:44.086 --> 00:39:45.767
(Peace for all living things.)

00:40:04.656 --> 00:40:05.168
Ma'am.

00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:07.520
- Hello.
- Really working hard.

00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:08.720
Doing homework so early.

00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:10.280
He didn't do it yesterday.

00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:11.680
Look at him.

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:13.760
Just write here.

00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:15.160
What's this?

00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:16.528
- Soy milk and breadsticks.
- Stomachache.

00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:17.960
It's a big problem.

00:40:20.735 --> 00:40:23.600
(Grand Opening)

00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:24.160
Good for you.

00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:25.560
It just opened.

00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:26.920
What would you like?

00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:28.200
I...

00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:30.120
The Wanbao Tower around the corner

00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:31.160
is mine.

00:40:32.120 --> 00:40:34.000
If you have any trouble
in this market later,

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:35.360
just mention my name, Lv.

00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:37.280
Got it. Thanks, Mr. Lv.

00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:37.960
No problem.

00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:40.280
So fresh.

00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:41.640
Made with good oil.

00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:44.400
Mr. Lv,

00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:46.280
I'm using freshly opened new oil.

00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:48.600
Here, let me pack two for you to try.

00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:50.040
