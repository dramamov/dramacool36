The number you have dialed is unavailable.
Connecting to voicemail...

00:00:49.714 --> 00:00:51.382
Why isn't she picking up?

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.522
Mi Sook, let's grab that drink next time.

00:00:58.889 --> 00:00:59.523
Why?

00:00:59.523 --> 00:01:02.326
I'm calling the nanny,
but she's not picking up at all.

00:01:02.326 --> 00:01:04.262
Really? Okay, then go ahead.

00:01:04.262 --> 00:01:06.230
Okay, sorry. I'll head out first.

00:01:09.767 --> 00:01:10.668
Ma'am!

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:13.471
Min Woo!

(NO Won Bin)

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.592
The power is off...

00:01:36.727 --> 00:01:37.728
Noh Min Woo!

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:39.497
Noh Min Jun!

00:01:40.932 --> 00:01:41.732
Min Woo!

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:43.801
Min Jun!

00:01:44.735 --> 00:01:46.404
Mom!

00:01:46.404 --> 00:01:48.039
Mom.

00:01:49.674 --> 00:01:50.474
You guys.

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:53.144
What happened?

00:01:53.144 --> 00:01:55.746
You scared me. I was so worried.

00:01:56.247 --> 00:01:58.849
Ma'am, why weren't you
answering your phone?

00:02:01.152 --> 00:02:02.687
I didn't realize the battery died.

00:02:03.821 --> 00:02:06.223
But this isn't my fault.

00:02:06.524 --> 00:02:08.626
We've been at the playground
for three hours now.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.662
Really?

00:02:11.662 --> 00:02:14.231
Well, at least nothing happened,
so that's a relief.

00:02:14.231 --> 00:02:15.600
I think you can head home now.

00:02:15.967 --> 00:02:17.335
Ms. Cho.

00:02:18.469 --> 00:02:21.005
I'm sorry, but I'm going to quit.

00:02:21.639 --> 00:02:23.307
All of a sudden? What do you mean?

00:02:23.841 --> 00:02:25.810
I only ever raised girls,

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.779
and now I've learned how wild boys can be.

00:02:28.779 --> 00:02:30.514
And the hours are way too unpredictable.

00:02:30.514 --> 00:02:31.682
I can't do this anymore.

00:02:31.682 --> 00:02:32.450
Wait.

00:02:33.251 --> 00:02:35.786
You can't just quit like this
out of the blue.

00:02:35.786 --> 00:02:38.322
You know I have to go to work.

00:02:38.322 --> 00:02:40.224
That's your problem, not mine.

00:02:40.758 --> 00:02:42.660
I'm sorry.

00:02:42.994 --> 00:02:44.395
I really am.

00:02:44.395 --> 00:02:47.999
Then I'll double your hourly pay.

00:02:47.999 --> 00:02:49.800
Please think it over just once more.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.535
Double or triple.

00:02:51.535 --> 00:02:53.905
What's the point if I end up
laid up in bed from all this?

00:02:54.505 --> 00:02:55.473
I'm quitting.

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.208
Ma'am, wait.

00:02:57.208 --> 00:02:58.409
Ma'am.

00:03:00.912 --> 00:03:02.813
Mom, push me on the swing.

00:03:02.813 --> 00:03:04.582
No, me first.

00:03:04.582 --> 00:03:06.784
I asked first.

00:03:06.784 --> 00:03:07.919
No.

00:03:07.919 --> 00:03:10.922
Mom, push my swing first.

00:03:10.922 --> 00:03:12.523
You kids, be quiet!

00:03:19.664 --> 00:03:22.500
Why is your phone dead every single day?

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:23.768
The battery died.

00:03:23.768 --> 00:03:25.603
Where's your head these days?

00:03:25.603 --> 00:03:27.171
I told you the nanny's been acting off,

00:03:27.171 --> 00:03:28.506
and told you to come early if you can,
didn't I?

00:03:29.106 --> 00:03:30.241
She quit.

00:03:31.042 --> 00:03:31.742
Really?

00:03:32.577 --> 00:03:34.745
I'm really sorry.
I've been so out of it lately.

00:03:34.745 --> 00:03:35.746
Seriously.

00:03:36.113 --> 00:03:37.682
Did you call the agency?

00:03:37.682 --> 00:03:40.084
They said it's hard to find someone
on such short notice.

00:03:40.718 --> 00:03:42.353
This is bad.

00:03:42.353 --> 00:03:44.956
And we can't exactly ask your mom
to watch three kids.

00:03:45.656 --> 00:03:48.326
What about asking your dad?

00:03:48.326 --> 00:03:49.894
- My dad?
- Yeah.

00:03:49.894 --> 00:03:51.362
How can my dad look after our kids?

00:03:51.362 --> 00:03:52.964
Why not? You told me...

00:03:52.964 --> 00:03:54.932
that your dad was more sensitive
than your mom.

00:03:54.932 --> 00:03:57.468
Can we just ask him
until we find a new nanny?

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:06.944
Hey, son.

00:04:07.411 --> 00:04:09.447
Why are you calling this late at night?

00:04:10.081 --> 00:04:12.383
I just thought of you and wanted to call.

00:04:12.383 --> 00:04:13.417
How are you doing?

00:04:13.417 --> 00:04:15.886
I'm going crazy here, stuck at home.

00:04:15.886 --> 00:04:17.321
- Stuck at home?
- Yeah.

00:04:18.823 --> 00:04:19.957
Well,

00:04:20.591 --> 00:04:22.360
I was coming home after drinking in town,

00:04:22.927 --> 00:04:25.930
and I slipped in the field
and twisted my ankle.

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.568
Are you okay now?

00:04:30.568 --> 00:04:32.670
I'm fine.

00:04:33.204 --> 00:04:35.606
I didn't want you guys worrying,
so I didn't say anything.

00:04:36.073 --> 00:04:38.876
Is everything good over there?

00:04:41.579 --> 00:04:43.681
Yes, we're doing fine.

00:04:50.688 --> 00:04:51.756
Damn.

00:04:52.056 --> 00:04:54.358
Damn.

00:04:56.794 --> 00:04:59.664
Why did I kiss him?

00:05:09.774 --> 00:05:11.375
You don't need to like me right now.

00:05:13.177 --> 00:05:14.445
Because I'm going to make you fall for me.

00:05:39.937 --> 00:05:41.305
Lee Il Ri.

00:05:41.305 --> 00:05:42.373
Are you out of your mind?

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:45.309
He's Byeon Sang Gyu.

00:05:45.309 --> 00:05:47.445
The country boy from Busan,
Byeon Sang Gyu.

00:05:50.314 --> 00:05:52.850
Today's story is simple.

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:54.885
She's grateful he likes her,

00:05:55.653 --> 00:05:57.655
but she just doesn't feel the same.

00:05:57.655 --> 00:06:00.391
Honestly, I relate to the sender.

00:06:00.391 --> 00:06:02.026
When someone likes you,

00:06:02.493 --> 00:06:06.163
pushing them away isn't
as easy as it sounds.

00:06:06.163 --> 00:06:07.465
Honestly, I...

00:06:07.465 --> 00:06:09.033
You don't have to like me right now.

00:06:10.034 --> 00:06:11.335
Because I'm going to make you fall for me.

00:06:11.769 --> 00:06:13.170
But what does that even mean?

00:06:15.072 --> 00:06:16.974
Does that mean he likes me?

00:06:16.974 --> 00:06:18.776
Or that he wants to win me over?

00:06:20.578 --> 00:06:22.847
Or is he just saying anything
because he wants to sleep with me?

00:06:24.649 --> 00:06:26.717
Yes, I get it.

00:06:26.717 --> 00:06:28.586
Of course,
you want to believe he likes you.

00:06:28.586 --> 00:06:30.288
Who wouldn't understand that feeling?

00:06:30.288 --> 00:06:33.257
But there's a reason people say
you look different...

00:06:33.257 --> 00:06:34.859
going into the bathroom and coming out.

00:06:34.859 --> 00:06:36.294
If a guy can sleep with a woman,

00:06:36.294 --> 00:06:39.263
he'll say he'll bring her
the moon and the stars.

00:06:39.263 --> 00:06:40.598
That's men.

00:06:40.831 --> 00:06:42.600
No.

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:44.969
If he just wanted to sleep with her,

00:06:44.969 --> 00:06:46.470
he'd say, "You look so pretty today,"

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:49.307
or "I've had feelings for you for ages."

00:06:49.307 --> 00:06:51.742
But this is an expression of will.

00:06:51.742 --> 00:06:53.711
He's saying
he'll make her fall for him someday,

00:06:53.711 --> 00:06:54.979
and that he won't rush it.

00:06:54.979 --> 00:06:56.614
It's a romantic promise.

00:06:56.614 --> 00:06:59.283
Then why go silent for several days?

00:06:59.283 --> 00:07:01.385
If a guy sleeps with someone once
and then pushes hard the next day,

00:07:01.385 --> 00:07:03.220
what woman would like that?

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:04.922
The more that happens,
the more careful he'll be.

00:07:04.922 --> 00:07:07.592
He's just trying to approach her
without freaking her out.

00:07:07.592 --> 00:07:10.595
Come on, don't read too much into it.

00:07:10.595 --> 00:07:12.663
That just makes things messier.

00:07:12.663 --> 00:07:15.466
No, it's a sign he likes her.

00:07:15.833 --> 00:07:18.069
- I'm telling you it's not.
- No.

00:07:18.069 --> 00:07:19.136
Ms. Lee.

00:07:19.136 --> 00:07:21.339
You're not imagining...

00:07:21.339 --> 00:07:22.974
walking down the aisle with him...

00:07:23.307 --> 00:07:25.676
after one one-night stand, are you?

00:07:25.977 --> 00:07:27.278
Come on.

00:07:28.246 --> 00:07:31.415
(Blunt Sister's Sensible Advice)

00:08:41.118 --> 00:08:42.887
Are you heading to work now?

00:08:42.887 --> 00:08:44.155
You're leaving late today.

00:08:44.155 --> 00:08:46.057
Yeah, you're heading out late, too.

00:08:46.057 --> 00:08:47.458
It's an outdoor shoot.

00:08:47.458 --> 00:08:49.060
So I can go straight to the location.

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:50.628
Shall we go?

00:08:51.095 --> 00:08:51.929
Yeah.

00:09:03.541 --> 00:09:04.742
Did you sleep well that night?

00:09:05.343 --> 00:09:06.177
That night?

00:09:07.578 --> 00:09:08.546
What night?

00:09:09.814 --> 00:09:11.082
Right, that night?

00:09:11.349 --> 00:09:12.483
Sorry.

00:09:12.483 --> 00:09:14.385
I really should quit drinking.

00:09:14.385 --> 00:09:16.754
I don't remember how I got home.

00:09:17.755 --> 00:09:20.891
I remember having baijiu
at the Chinese place, and that's it.

00:09:21.459 --> 00:09:22.927
I didn't do anything stupid, right?

00:09:23.427 --> 00:09:25.463
Is this the best you've got, Lee Il Ri?

00:09:26.864 --> 00:09:28.499
Yeah, nothing like that happened.

00:09:30.501 --> 00:09:31.402
Good.

00:09:33.571 --> 00:09:35.940
I'll get going. Good luck today.

00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:38.175
Yes, you too. Have a good day.

00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:46.584
What the...

00:09:47.084 --> 00:09:49.220
He's ignoring me
because I ignored him first?

00:09:56.727 --> 00:10:00.498
Is there really no one
who can even do part-time?

00:10:02.867 --> 00:10:04.035
I see.

00:10:04.035 --> 00:10:05.469
Yes, okay. Thank you.

00:10:09.173 --> 00:10:10.107
(Madam Ahn Soon Im)

00:10:10.975 --> 00:10:11.976
Yes, Mom.

00:10:13.477 --> 00:10:14.812
Where's the nanny?

00:10:15.613 --> 00:10:17.715
She's normally here at this hour.

00:10:19.116 --> 00:10:20.685
She quit.

00:10:21.419 --> 00:10:22.186
What?

00:10:23.554 --> 00:10:25.856
She quit? What do you mean?

00:10:25.856 --> 00:10:27.959
With the hours all over the place...

00:10:27.959 --> 00:10:29.694
and two boys, she said it was too much.

00:10:31.128 --> 00:10:32.797
Then what about the kids?

00:10:36.033 --> 00:10:37.368
Should I watch them for now?

00:10:41.906 --> 00:10:44.942
Mom, you can't watch three kids.

00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:46.510
Why not?

00:10:46.877 --> 00:10:49.780
You're always mad, saying I only
watch your brother's kid anyway.

00:10:50.548 --> 00:10:53.851
That's just because
Jae Jeong is so annoying.

00:10:54.619 --> 00:10:57.388
Anyway, Won Bin said
he'll try adjusting his schedule.

00:10:57.388 --> 00:10:59.290
We'll just have to look in the meantime.

00:10:59.857 --> 00:11:01.058
Don't worry, Mom.

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:07.031
I brought soy-braised beef
and radish kimchi for the kids.

00:11:07.398 --> 00:11:09.333
I'll put them in the fridge,
so make sure they eat.

00:11:09.333 --> 00:11:12.036
Mom, you really didn't have to.

00:11:12.703 --> 00:11:13.638
Get to work.

00:11:14.572 --> 00:11:15.439
Okay.

00:11:17.808 --> 00:11:18.676
Goodness.

00:11:55.379 --> 00:11:56.180
No.

00:12:03.554 --> 00:12:04.388
Excuse me.

00:12:05.856 --> 00:12:07.024
I'm sorry.

00:12:07.024 --> 00:12:07.959
I'm so sorry.

00:12:08.793 --> 00:12:09.961
I'm so sorry.

00:12:10.494 --> 00:12:12.964
The traffic was awful. I'm really sorry.

00:12:12.964 --> 00:12:14.865
- Please don't be late next time, ma'am.
- Yes.

00:12:15.333 --> 00:12:16.534
Tae Rin, bye.

00:12:16.534 --> 00:12:18.035
Thank you, ma'am.

00:12:19.303 --> 00:12:20.171
Thank you.

00:12:34.719 --> 00:12:36.087
(Daughter-in-law)

00:12:39.890 --> 00:12:40.758
Hey.

00:12:41.325 --> 00:12:42.593
Did you go somewhere?

00:12:43.628 --> 00:12:46.297
Her teacher called me.
She said you didn't show up.

00:12:46.964 --> 00:12:48.332
Well,

00:12:48.332 --> 00:12:51.202
I was buying stickers that Tae Rin likes,
so I got a bit delayed.

00:12:51.202 --> 00:12:53.237
I picked her up now, so don't worry.

00:12:53.771 --> 00:12:55.373
It must be tough, Mother.

00:12:56.107 --> 00:12:59.277
But don't you think
a promise is more important than stickers?

00:13:00.411 --> 00:13:01.379
If you're late,

00:13:01.379 --> 00:13:03.981
the moms after us all get held up.

00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:08.519
You didn't forget
the tutor is coming, right?

00:13:08.819 --> 00:13:11.555
Tae Rin hasn't finished her homework,
so please help her do it.

00:13:12.156 --> 00:13:13.190
And, Mother,

00:13:14.125 --> 00:13:15.393
I'd prefer...

00:13:16.127 --> 00:13:18.596
if you didn't keep giving
candy or caramels as rewards.

00:13:20.298 --> 00:13:21.999
If I don't give her at least that,

00:13:21.999 --> 00:13:24.835
she won't listen to me at all.
What am I supposed to do?

00:13:24.835 --> 00:13:27.939
But if you start breaking rules like that,
it won't be good for her.

00:13:28.873 --> 00:13:30.675
Homework is something
she's supposed to do.

00:13:31.676 --> 00:13:33.144
I'm worried she'll pick up bad habits.

00:13:34.545 --> 00:13:36.280
All right, fine.

00:13:37.148 --> 00:13:38.215
Thank you, Mother.

00:13:38.449 --> 00:13:40.685
Then, have a good day.

00:13:43.888 --> 00:13:44.755
Tae Rin.

00:13:45.022 --> 00:13:47.925
Why are you climbing up there?
That's dangerous.

00:13:47.925 --> 00:13:49.226
Come down. Careful.

00:13:49.493 --> 00:13:50.461
You...

00:13:53.864 --> 00:13:54.932
What?

00:13:54.932 --> 00:13:55.733
Hey.

00:13:56.133 --> 00:13:57.802
Did you ask Mom to watch your kids?

00:13:58.669 --> 00:14:00.738
No, I never said that.

00:14:01.205 --> 00:14:02.640
You're overreacting.

00:14:02.974 --> 00:14:05.376
Then why is Mom suddenly saying
she'll watch your kids this weekend?

00:14:05.776 --> 00:14:07.178
Didn't you ask her?

00:14:07.178 --> 00:14:08.412
No.

00:14:08.913 --> 00:14:09.880
Anyway,

00:14:10.214 --> 00:14:12.149
you must've whined about something
for her to say that.

00:14:12.149 --> 00:14:14.352
- Seriously?
- If Mom gets sick,

00:14:14.552 --> 00:14:15.886
are you going to take responsibility?

00:14:17.521 --> 00:14:20.491
Even if she offers,
you should turn her down flat.

00:14:20.491 --> 00:14:21.592
Stop whining...

00:14:21.592 --> 00:14:23.294
and stressing her out.

00:14:23.828 --> 00:14:26.631
And why are you so irresponsible?

00:14:26.998 --> 00:14:29.166
You start work
without lining up a proper nanny first?

00:14:29.166 --> 00:14:30.701
How could you do that?

00:14:31.168 --> 00:14:34.005
She quit out of nowhere.
What do you expect me to do?

00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:38.609
Being able to spot that in advance
is part of being capable, you know.

00:14:42.079 --> 00:14:43.114
I can't even.

00:14:44.949 --> 00:14:47.118
Yes, I'm on my way. Sorry.

00:14:48.185 --> 00:14:49.887
Cho Jae Jeong, that jerk.

00:14:49.887 --> 00:14:51.389
He's always so annoying.

00:14:55.493 --> 00:14:57.528
What's with that cold look?

00:14:58.195 --> 00:14:59.297
Was I the only one who liked it?

00:14:59.931 --> 00:15:01.198
He didn't enjoy it at all?

00:15:02.366 --> 00:15:05.469
This is killing my pride.

00:15:08.239 --> 00:15:09.507
Did I not do a good job that day?

00:15:11.309 --> 00:15:12.143
Deputy Editor!

00:15:12.610 --> 00:15:13.578
You scared me!

00:15:14.345 --> 00:15:15.313
Did you knock?

00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:16.647
I knocked.

00:15:16.647 --> 00:15:18.115
What were you thinking about so hard?

00:15:18.115 --> 00:15:19.183
Have a sandwich.

00:15:25.690 --> 00:15:28.659
Hey, that feature was good, Hye Jeong.

00:15:28.659 --> 00:15:29.460
Which one?

00:15:30.094 --> 00:15:31.929
"Ten little things...

00:15:31.929 --> 00:15:33.965
that make a woman fall for a man."

00:15:34.732 --> 00:15:36.667
But can this really be a charm?

00:15:36.901 --> 00:15:39.437
You know how there are guys...

00:15:39.437 --> 00:15:40.738
who have that uniquely nice smell?

00:15:41.505 --> 00:15:43.841
It's not perfume,

00:15:43.841 --> 00:15:45.543
and not soap.

00:15:46.344 --> 00:15:47.845
It's weird.

00:15:48.212 --> 00:15:51.048
That means
you're sexually attracted to the guy.

00:15:51.048 --> 00:15:52.416
It's the pheromone scent.

00:15:53.384 --> 00:15:54.252
What?

00:15:54.585 --> 00:15:55.620
Sexually?

00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:58.789
Deputy Editor,
your face is totally red right now.

00:15:58.789 --> 00:15:59.724
Who is it?

00:15:59.724 --> 00:16:02.326
Who is this guy who makes you blush
just by thinking about him?

00:16:03.127 --> 00:16:03.928
What?

00:16:03.928 --> 00:16:07.531
I'm saying that also counts as a charm,

00:16:07.531 --> 00:16:09.600
so add it as the 11th one...

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:11.302
and update the article.

00:16:11.302 --> 00:16:12.536
That's not true.

00:16:12.536 --> 00:16:15.606
She said "It's weird" just now.

00:16:15.606 --> 00:16:16.741
Right?

00:16:16.741 --> 00:16:17.708
Yeah.

00:16:17.708 --> 00:16:19.610
Don't make me sound weird.

00:16:21.312 --> 00:16:22.546
Eat up and get back to work.

00:16:23.781 --> 00:16:25.049
There is someone.

00:16:25.449 --> 00:16:26.384
There is.

00:16:26.951 --> 00:16:29.320
Write it down. Number 11, pheromone scent.

00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:30.187
Pheromone scent.

00:16:32.857 --> 00:16:34.692
Sexually attracted to that bumpkin?

00:16:35.927 --> 00:16:36.894
No way.

00:16:39.997 --> 00:16:42.266
Is that why I went crazy
and came on to him that day?

00:16:50.775 --> 00:16:52.977
Dude, are you at the clinic?

00:17:03.821 --> 00:17:04.722
Yeah, why?

00:17:07.291 --> 00:17:10.094
I must've slept wrong.
My neck's all stiff.

00:17:10.928 --> 00:17:13.464
If I go now, can I get treatment?

00:17:14.031 --> 00:17:15.433
Yeah, come.

00:17:17.368 --> 00:17:18.202
Okay.

00:17:32.416 --> 00:17:33.217
All right.

00:17:33.618 --> 00:17:36.787
When your memory's fuzzy, you go check,

00:17:36.787 --> 00:17:38.022
and shatter the fantasy.

00:17:38.723 --> 00:17:39.690
Go,

00:17:40.191 --> 00:17:42.727
and cut your feelings off
for good, Lee Il Ri.

(Doctor Bone Gaon Orthopedics)

00:18:03.147 --> 00:18:03.981
Hey.

00:18:11.489 --> 00:18:14.191
Make your shoulder like this and...

00:18:14.659 --> 00:18:17.194
(Manual Therapy Room)

00:18:17.194 --> 00:18:18.229
Goodness.

00:18:18.229 --> 00:18:20.765
Look at this.
Your neck is completely knotted up.

00:18:21.966 --> 00:18:25.202
You still haven't adjusted
your monitor height, have you?

00:18:25.202 --> 00:18:26.804
Didn't I tell you not to do that?

00:18:27.371 --> 00:18:30.274
I did adjust it.

00:18:31.075 --> 00:18:32.443
Sit on your hands like this.

00:18:34.111 --> 00:18:36.314
Okay, relax.

00:18:36.814 --> 00:18:37.648
Okay.

00:18:40.017 --> 00:18:41.252
Inhale.

00:18:41.852 --> 00:18:42.920
Exhale.

00:18:44.956 --> 00:18:46.390
Okay, inhale.

00:18:49.894 --> 00:18:52.630
If you don't want to keep coming here,

00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:55.032
you need to exercise regularly.
Do pilates or yoga, or anything like that.

00:18:57.301 --> 00:18:58.135
Got it?

00:19:01.439 --> 00:19:02.240
Arms forward.

00:19:04.842 --> 00:19:05.843
Bring your arms together.

00:19:08.846 --> 00:19:10.181
Chin down.

00:19:10.181 --> 00:19:11.515
Look up at a 45-degree angle.

00:19:12.250 --> 00:19:13.818
Okay, inhale.

00:19:14.352 --> 00:19:15.686
Exhale.

00:19:17.755 --> 00:19:19.957
Again. Inhale.

00:19:20.358 --> 00:19:21.325
Exhale.

00:19:24.495 --> 00:19:25.463
One more.

00:19:25.463 --> 00:19:26.330
(BPM 131)

00:19:30.701 --> 00:19:32.270
Your heart is about to burst.

00:19:33.004 --> 00:19:34.171
No.

00:19:34.505 --> 00:19:37.174
It's because you're pressing too hard.

00:19:37.174 --> 00:19:38.509
Go easy.

00:19:39.644 --> 00:19:40.478
Okay.

00:19:41.946 --> 00:19:43.581
One more time.

00:19:44.215 --> 00:19:45.850
Inhale.

00:19:46.684 --> 00:19:47.585
Exhale.

00:19:48.119 --> 00:19:49.320
Your heart rate...

(Women's Changing Room)

00:19:57.728 --> 00:19:59.196
I'm insane.

00:19:59.196 --> 00:20:01.198
I'm definitely insane.

00:20:02.333 --> 00:20:03.301
Damn it.

00:20:03.768 --> 00:20:06.270
Why was my heart
pounding like crazy there?

00:20:13.544 --> 00:20:15.846
So a drunk friend was taking a taxi home,

00:20:15.846 --> 00:20:17.148
and when I asked, "Where are you going?"

00:20:17.148 --> 00:20:18.449
- "I'm going home," he said.
- I see.

00:20:18.449 --> 00:20:20.518
"But we're drinking at your house."

00:20:23.054 --> 00:20:24.622
- That's hilarious.
- So then...

00:20:24.622 --> 00:20:26.557
Doctor Byeon, you're so funny.

00:20:26.857 --> 00:20:29.594
Am I jealous right now?

00:20:31.862 --> 00:20:32.663
Wait.

Il Ri.

00:20:41.105 --> 00:20:41.973
Hey, Il Ri.

00:20:43.908 --> 00:20:45.343
Why aren't you saying goodbye?

00:20:46.244 --> 00:20:47.645
I'm almost done here.

00:20:47.645 --> 00:20:49.914
Wait and have dinner with me.

00:20:50.715 --> 00:20:51.916
No, thanks.

00:20:51.916 --> 00:20:54.986
You seem really popular.
Eat with your coworkers.

00:20:55.753 --> 00:20:57.955
Il Ri, you're going to have dinner anyway.

00:20:57.955 --> 00:21:00.191
There's a great army stew place nearby.

00:21:00.491 --> 00:21:02.093
Let's eat. It's on me.

00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:03.561
I said no.

00:21:04.362 --> 00:21:05.196
But...

00:21:16.641 --> 00:21:19.176
Are you crazy?
Watch where you're going!

00:21:20.645 --> 00:21:22.280
Il Ri, are you okay?

00:21:23.314 --> 00:21:24.215
Are you hurt?

00:21:25.449 --> 00:21:26.984
Man, that scared me.

00:21:27.618 --> 00:21:29.053
I'm busy.

(Oh Sang Min

00:23:23.734 --> 00:23:26.671
Your delicious bulgogi
and seaweed soup are here.

00:23:26.671 --> 00:23:29.040
- Bulgogi!
- Meat!

00:23:29.674 --> 00:23:31.876
Eat up, Min Woo, Min Jun.
You must be starving.

00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:36.881
Here.

00:23:37.648 --> 00:23:38.583
Water.

00:23:39.951 --> 00:23:41.819
Min Jun, have some water too.

00:23:45.089 --> 00:23:45.990
Mom's here.

00:23:46.924 --> 00:23:50.461
- Mom.
- Hey, my little princes.

00:23:50.461 --> 00:23:52.663
Did you have fun at kindergarten?

00:23:52.663 --> 00:23:54.031
- Yeah.
- Okay, eat up.

00:23:54.031 --> 00:23:55.399
You haven't eaten yet, right?
Sit down.

00:23:56.567 --> 00:23:58.603
Why are you being so sweet these days?

00:23:58.903 --> 00:23:59.870
It's nothing.

00:24:00.371 --> 00:24:02.840
I just feel bad leaving everything to you.

00:24:03.574 --> 00:24:05.343
I'm touched, honey.

00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:08.579
Since when did you get this soft-hearted?

00:24:13.351 --> 00:24:15.786
Honey, did you make the bulgogi
and the seaweed soup?

00:24:15.786 --> 00:24:17.321
No, they were already in the fridge.

00:24:17.622 --> 00:24:18.556
I thought you made them.

00:24:20.091 --> 00:24:21.692
I didn't.

(Na Jeong)

00:24:33.871 --> 00:24:34.672
Hey.

00:24:47.618 --> 00:24:48.853
What?

00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:51.989
Mom, did you make bulgogi
and seaweed soup?

00:24:52.523 --> 00:24:53.491
Yeah.

00:24:53.491 --> 00:24:55.760
I meant to text you, but I forgot.

00:24:56.127 --> 00:24:57.261
Did the kids eat?

00:24:57.261 --> 00:24:59.730
Why do you keep coming
when I told you not to?

00:24:59.730 --> 00:25:01.566
What if you really make yourself sick?

00:25:02.166 --> 00:25:04.068
And why did you clean the house?

00:25:04.068 --> 00:25:06.137
You're going to wear yourself out.

00:25:06.137 --> 00:25:07.605
You'll end up spending more
on hospital bills.

00:25:07.605 --> 00:25:08.472
Good grief.

00:25:09.206 --> 00:25:10.975
If you're grateful, just say thank you.

00:25:10.975 --> 00:25:12.076
Why are you snapping at me?

00:25:27.158 --> 00:25:28.025
What?

00:25:28.893 --> 00:25:30.995
Mom, I'm sorry.

00:25:31.929 --> 00:25:34.131
Your moods flip so fast.

00:25:34.865 --> 00:25:37.568
I just feel so guilty toward you, Mom.

00:25:38.402 --> 00:25:41.639
I jumped back into work without thinking,

00:25:42.173 --> 00:25:44.308
and it feels like I'm just
making your life harder.

00:25:44.775 --> 00:25:45.910
What are you talking about?

00:25:45.910 --> 00:25:47.411
Don't you ever say that again.

00:25:47.912 --> 00:25:49.680
You have no idea how proud I am...

00:25:50.248 --> 00:25:52.683
- that you started working even...
- How many times did I tell you?

00:25:52.683 --> 00:25:54.986
You can't eat this stuff
because you've got cavities.

00:25:54.986 --> 00:25:56.721
- It's all junk.
- I'll call you later.

00:25:56.721 --> 00:25:57.788
Okay.

00:25:57.989 --> 00:25:58.889
Bye.

00:25:59.090 --> 00:26:00.358
Throw all of that away.

00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:03.294
Now!

00:26:09.166 --> 00:26:10.801
And go to the time-out room.

00:26:13.671 --> 00:26:14.672
What happened?

00:26:17.642 --> 00:26:20.778
Did you give Tae Rin caramel, Mother?

00:26:21.979 --> 00:26:22.914
Yeah.

00:26:23.648 --> 00:26:25.116
We agreed she gets one...

00:26:25.116 --> 00:26:27.852
only after her homework.

00:26:28.252 --> 00:26:31.055
How many times have I asked you
not to give her that?

00:26:31.055 --> 00:26:34.292
How am I supposed to calm a kid down
without at least something like that?

00:26:34.692 --> 00:26:36.360
Then you should've disciplined her.

00:26:36.761 --> 00:26:38.429
You keep giving her treats like that...

00:26:38.429 --> 00:26:39.897
just to get a break,

00:26:39.897 --> 00:26:41.666
and now she's got cavities.

00:26:42.433 --> 00:26:43.367
Fine.

00:26:44.068 --> 00:26:47.071
I won't give her candy or caramel again.

00:26:47.572 --> 00:26:49.974
You've been going to Na Jeong's
during the day, right?

00:26:51.342 --> 00:26:52.343
No.

00:26:52.343 --> 00:26:53.978
I know already, Mother.

00:26:55.179 --> 00:26:58.249
You thought I wouldn't notice
just because I didn't say anything?

00:26:59.016 --> 00:27:01.619
That's why you're exhausted
when it's Tae Rin's bath time,

00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:04.889
and why you're late for pickup.

00:27:06.023 --> 00:27:07.892
This is too much.

00:27:08.859 --> 00:27:09.694
Hey.

00:27:10.428 --> 00:27:12.964
Do you pay me to work as a nanny?

00:27:14.332 --> 00:27:15.766
Why are you butting into everything?

00:27:16.534 --> 00:27:17.568
Mother.

00:27:17.568 --> 00:27:20.304
And didn't Na Jeong quit her job...

00:27:20.304 --> 00:27:23.040
because I was watching your kids?

00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:26.544
You should feel bad,
not talking to me like that.

00:27:26.811 --> 00:27:28.079
If you talk to me this way, Mother,

00:27:28.946 --> 00:27:31.115
how can I say anything to you?

00:27:37.989 --> 00:27:38.990
I'm home.

00:27:41.525 --> 00:27:42.393
What's going on?

00:27:42.927 --> 00:27:43.728
What happened?

00:27:46.297 --> 00:27:47.198
Ask her.

00:27:47.965 --> 00:27:49.967
Mother is blaming us...

00:27:50.534 --> 00:27:51.602
for Na Jeong quitting her job.

00:27:53.638 --> 00:27:54.538
Mom.

00:27:57.675 --> 00:27:59.343
Why would you say that?

00:28:02.146 --> 00:28:03.014
You know what?

00:28:03.781 --> 00:28:05.583
I'm done.

00:28:05.583 --> 00:28:07.084
Why should I put up with this...

00:28:07.084 --> 00:28:09.787
and work like your servant?

00:28:09.787 --> 00:28:12.657
Stop walking on eggshells
around your mother-in-law...

00:28:13.224 --> 00:28:15.259
and hire someone you actually want,

00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:17.395
and treat her however you'd like.

00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:23.334
Mother.

00:28:23.334 --> 00:28:24.168
Mom.

00:28:25.703 --> 00:28:26.470
Mom.

00:28:27.371 --> 00:28:28.406
I can't.

00:28:37.882 --> 00:28:38.716
Mom.

00:28:39.183 --> 00:28:41.953
You should've come home, not here.

00:28:41.953 --> 00:28:43.254
How am I supposed to barge...

00:28:43.721 --> 00:28:45.856
into my son-in-law's house at this hour?

00:28:45.856 --> 00:28:47.391
It's your daughter's house too,
not just your son-in-law's.

00:28:47.825 --> 00:28:50.094
Anyway, why did you rush all the way here?

00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:57.235
Unbelievable.

00:29:02.607 --> 00:29:06.043
I just told your sister-in-law
and your brother...

00:29:06.844 --> 00:29:09.480
that I'm done babysitting.

00:29:10.314 --> 00:29:12.083
Why? What happened?

00:29:24.562 --> 00:29:26.497
I'm honestly stunned.

00:29:27.899 --> 00:29:31.035
If you're paying someone, fine.
Treat them however you want.

00:29:31.569 --> 00:29:34.405
But they buy golf clubs like nothing,

00:29:34.405 --> 00:29:37.174
and for six years,
they've given me a measly 500 dollars.

00:29:37.174 --> 00:29:39.644
And they say, "Make Tae Rin study."

00:29:39.644 --> 00:29:41.913
"Don't give candy."

00:29:41.913 --> 00:29:43.714
"Don't give the tablet."

00:29:43.714 --> 00:29:44.715
Please.

00:29:45.616 --> 00:29:47.585
But on holidays,

00:29:47.919 --> 00:29:49.987
they hand Tae Rin a tablet all day long.

00:29:50.588 --> 00:29:52.890
That Cho Jae Jeong.

00:29:52.890 --> 00:29:54.558
He's been selfish since he was little,

00:29:54.558 --> 00:29:56.460
and he's never changed.

00:29:56.460 --> 00:29:58.629
You're not much different, Na Jeong.

00:29:58.863 --> 00:30:01.799
I told you parenting isn't all
in the books.

00:30:01.799 --> 00:30:04.168
"If you don't know, stay out of it."
This is what you said.

00:30:05.236 --> 00:30:08.439
If the mom's uneducated,
nothing she does is ever right.

00:30:08.439 --> 00:30:09.874
That's how you and your sister-in-law act.

00:30:09.874 --> 00:30:12.009
Don't drink too fast.

00:30:12.009 --> 00:30:13.210
You'll upset your stomach.

00:30:13.210 --> 00:30:14.178
Damn it.

00:30:14.178 --> 00:30:16.180
Can't I even have a drink
the way I want now?

00:30:18.883 --> 00:30:19.717
Seriously.

00:30:31.963 --> 00:30:34.332
In my later years,

00:30:34.332 --> 00:30:36.834
I just wanted to live with a bit of grace.

00:30:37.602 --> 00:30:38.502
Okay?

00:30:38.502 --> 00:30:40.171
After your dad died,

00:30:40.438 --> 00:30:41.872
did I ever take a single day off
running that restaurant?

00:30:43.241 --> 00:30:45.142
I spent my whole youth
working myself raw...

00:30:45.343 --> 00:30:48.946
just to keep us afloat, and now I'm sad.

00:30:49.614 --> 00:30:50.982
I wanted to try things...

00:30:51.916 --> 00:30:54.018
like flower arranging...

00:30:54.485 --> 00:30:57.755
or taking a barista course.

00:30:58.422 --> 00:30:59.957
But nope. Nothing.

00:31:00.625 --> 00:31:03.160
I'm on my feet longer now
than when I worked at the restaurant.

00:31:04.228 --> 00:31:06.264
At least the restaurant had days off.

00:31:07.198 --> 00:31:10.568
How is it that they guard
their own holidays so fiercely...

00:31:10.968 --> 00:31:13.638
but never think
of giving their mother one?

00:31:17.475 --> 00:31:18.309
Honestly.

00:31:27.885 --> 00:31:30.354
Honey, did something happen to Mother?

00:31:30.554 --> 00:31:32.156
Why did she drink herself into this state?

00:31:32.423 --> 00:31:35.326
She fought with my brother's family.
She must've been really upset.

00:31:35.326 --> 00:31:36.427
I see.

00:31:39.964 --> 00:31:42.533
You couldn't even say you were going
because of your daughter-in-law, right?

00:31:50.041 --> 00:31:51.309
Are you really not going?

00:31:51.676 --> 00:31:53.144
I told you.

00:31:53.144 --> 00:31:55.346
The kids only want me.

00:31:55.346 --> 00:31:57.048
Please.

00:31:57.048 --> 00:31:59.083
Grandma watches them
until her back gives out,

00:31:59.083 --> 00:32:01.218
and the second their parents walk in,
they pretend she doesn't exist.

00:32:01.218 --> 00:32:04.722
This might be our last trip together
as our all-girls-high-school crew.

00:32:04.722 --> 00:32:07.925
Just wait a few years.

00:32:07.925 --> 00:32:09.860
One by one we'll get sick...

00:32:09.860 --> 00:32:12.630
and won't be able to go.

00:34:05.876 --> 00:34:09.213
Mom, why are you up so early?

00:34:09.213 --> 00:34:10.448
Hey, you're up.

00:34:11.349 --> 00:34:12.350
What's this amazing smell?

00:34:17.888 --> 00:34:19.857
This is my favorite.

00:34:19.857 --> 00:34:23.361
Please, you're an adult.
Don't be like that.

00:34:24.128 --> 00:34:25.162
Good grief.

00:34:25.730 --> 00:34:27.031
- Taste it.
- Okay.

00:34:28.733 --> 00:34:29.667
It's hot.

00:34:30.067 --> 00:34:31.168
Here, try this.

00:34:39.744 --> 00:34:40.745
It's incredible.

00:34:42.146 --> 00:34:45.249
Mom, can you stay with me here forever?

00:34:45.816 --> 00:34:47.518
- Please?
- You're being silly.

00:34:48.286 --> 00:34:49.320
I can't resist.

00:34:49.987 --> 00:34:51.255
Can I get a bowl of rice?

00:34:56.160 --> 00:34:58.129
I can never say no to bean sprout soup.

00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:05.269
Trying to stay in shape for the show?

00:35:08.239 --> 00:35:09.273
What do you think?

00:35:09.273 --> 00:35:11.208
Do I look slimmer?

00:35:11.208 --> 00:35:14.111
You were always pretty,
but you're even prettier now.

00:35:14.111 --> 00:35:14.946
Right?

00:35:15.479 --> 00:35:17.114
Start eating first.

00:35:19.250 --> 00:35:21.652
Hey, slow down. It's hot.

00:35:25.122 --> 00:35:26.090
I'll get the rice.

00:35:39.971 --> 00:35:42.473
When you think of Koreans,
you think of rice, right?

00:35:43.074 --> 00:35:47.311
This hotel is famous
for its amazing breakfast buffet.

00:35:47.945 --> 00:35:49.814
They have a Korean chef,

00:35:49.814 --> 00:35:51.315
so you can get proper Korean food too.

00:35:51.315 --> 00:35:54.218
It's rated the best breakfast
in all of Bali.

00:35:54.719 --> 00:35:55.753
Let's move on to the next slide.

00:36:04.729 --> 00:36:06.097
Is the employee discount available too?

00:36:06.664 --> 00:36:08.432
I'll check and let you know.

00:36:10.601 --> 00:36:12.937
Yes, what you just saw...

00:36:12.937 --> 00:36:14.538
was the paragliding experience.

00:36:14.538 --> 00:36:16.073
Mother is at your place, right?

00:36:16.774 --> 00:36:19.777
Jae Jeong and I will pick her up
together this evening.

00:36:19.777 --> 00:36:21.545
Just looking at this
feels refreshing, doesn't it?

00:36:22.446 --> 00:36:24.715
All right, let's move on
to the next section.

00:36:26.083 --> 00:36:28.185
I misspoke, Mother.

00:36:28.185 --> 00:36:29.387
Actually, at the dentist,

00:36:29.387 --> 00:36:31.656
the doctor scolded me,

00:36:31.989 --> 00:36:33.691
asking why I wasn't taking
better care of her teeth.

00:36:34.892 --> 00:36:37.128
So I've been on edge,

00:36:38.863 --> 00:36:41.032
and I think I ended up
being rude to you, Mother.

00:36:42.934 --> 00:36:45.236
I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

00:36:46.103 --> 00:36:47.004
That's enough.

00:36:47.972 --> 00:36:49.840
I'm not doing this anymore.

00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:50.841
Mom.

00:36:51.409 --> 00:36:53.377
She's apologizing like this.

00:36:53.377 --> 00:36:54.845
Let it go now, okay?

00:36:55.313 --> 00:36:57.181
She knows she was wrong.

00:36:58.382 --> 00:37:01.485
We've both been busy and exhausted,

00:37:01.919 --> 00:37:03.454
and we know we haven't treated you right.

00:37:04.155 --> 00:37:05.923
We really are sorry.

00:37:06.691 --> 00:37:08.726
We'll do better,

00:37:08.726 --> 00:37:10.261
so please come back, okay?

00:37:11.596 --> 00:37:12.496
Mother,

00:37:13.331 --> 00:37:14.966
don't you miss Tae Rin?

00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:17.702
She keeps asking where Grandma went.

00:37:18.236 --> 00:37:19.604
She keeps crying and fussing.

00:37:19.604 --> 00:37:20.972
I said I'm done.

00:37:21.339 --> 00:37:24.108
I watched your kid for six years.
That's plenty.

00:37:24.108 --> 00:37:26.277
Why do you keep pushing me?

00:37:26.277 --> 00:37:29.347
Come on, don't put it that way.

00:37:29.347 --> 00:37:30.314
For six years,

00:37:30.314 --> 00:37:32.850
you were practically Tae Rin's mother.

00:37:32.850 --> 00:37:34.885
From her point of view,
this must be so shocking.

00:37:36.587 --> 00:37:40.024
These past few days, Tae Rin's been
sleep-talking again, Mother.

00:37:40.024 --> 00:37:41.025
You know what that means.

00:37:41.292 --> 00:37:42.760
When her anxiety spikes,

00:37:43.494 --> 00:37:44.862
the sleep-talking starts.

00:37:45.730 --> 00:37:47.465
I feel like she's struggling...

00:37:47.465 --> 00:37:49.767
all because of me, so I feel terrible.

00:37:51.269 --> 00:37:53.004
I can't even sleep, either.

00:37:54.705 --> 00:37:56.407
Well,

00:37:57.241 --> 00:37:59.043
I'm not blaming you.

00:37:59.043 --> 00:38:00.611
Exactly.

00:38:00.611 --> 00:38:03.547
Kids get hurt the most
when adults are fighting.

00:38:04.181 --> 00:38:06.617
You're perfect, Mom,

00:38:07.184 --> 00:38:09.186
but sometimes you flare up.

00:38:09.453 --> 00:38:10.388
Isn't that right?

00:38:10.922 --> 00:38:12.690
The more I listen, the worse this gets.

00:38:13.357 --> 00:38:16.127
Did Mom abandon
her own child or something?

00:38:16.460 --> 00:38:17.828
Why do you keep treating her
like she committed a crime?

00:38:18.195 --> 00:38:19.931
And who are you to butt in?

00:38:19.931 --> 00:38:21.999
And why can't I butt in?

00:38:21.999 --> 00:38:23.367
I'm Mom's daughter.

00:38:24.001 --> 00:38:27.138
Mom, didn't you say Jae Jeong
gives you 500 dollars?

00:38:27.138 --> 00:38:29.240
I'll give you 2,000 dollars,

00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:31.876
- so please watch my kids.
- Hey.

00:38:31.876 --> 00:38:33.110
Hey, Cho Na Jeong!

00:38:33.411 --> 00:38:35.713
Why? You can't pay her 2,000?

00:38:35.713 --> 00:38:38.349
If you can't,
don't even ask her to babysit.

00:38:39.116 --> 00:38:41.419
And who babysits these days...

00:38:41.419 --> 00:38:43.254
for less than 2,000 anyway?

00:38:43.654 --> 00:38:45.723
You buy new golf bags all the time...

00:38:45.723 --> 00:38:47.458
and dump the kids on Mom every weekend,

00:38:47.458 --> 00:38:49.160
and still only give her 500 dollars?
How is that okay?

00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:51.529
Cho Na Jeong! What's gotten into you?

00:38:51.529 --> 00:38:52.930
Stop.

00:38:52.930 --> 00:38:55.900
Why? I'm already talking,
so I might as well say everything.

00:38:56.267 --> 00:38:58.369
And honestly, because you and your wife...

00:38:59.136 --> 00:39:01.572
took Mom away, I had to quit my job.

00:39:01.572 --> 00:39:02.506
You know that, right?

00:39:03.908 --> 00:39:05.543
You had her help you
for six years, Jae Jeong.

00:39:06.177 --> 00:39:07.345
Now it's my turn.

00:39:07.345 --> 00:39:09.747
You have no manners at all.

00:39:09.947 --> 00:39:11.682
What? No manners?

00:39:13.150 --> 00:39:15.186
Look who's talking.

00:39:15.186 --> 00:39:18.356
If we're talking selfish,
you're in first place, Jae Jeong.

00:39:18.723 --> 00:39:21.993
Ever since we were kids,
you only cared about yourself...

00:39:21.993 --> 00:39:23.594
and never thought about anyone else.

00:39:23.594 --> 00:39:24.996
Do you have any idea...

00:39:24.996 --> 00:39:27.398
how much I suffered because of that?

00:39:27.398 --> 00:39:28.266
What?

00:39:28.266 --> 00:39:30.801
You knew we were broke,

00:39:30.801 --> 00:39:32.803
but you still demanded to study abroad.

00:39:32.803 --> 00:39:36.140
I felt so guilty I chipped in
for the living expenses every month.

00:39:36.140 --> 00:39:38.276
If that helped you get this far,

00:39:38.276 --> 00:39:40.478
then maybe try being decent now.

00:39:40.478 --> 00:39:42.914
Is Mom your maid who cleans up after you?

00:39:42.914 --> 00:39:44.215
Is being a parent some kind of crime?

00:39:44.215 --> 00:39:46.083
Mom doesn't belong to you.

00:39:46.083 --> 00:39:48.085
So why do you order her around?

00:39:48.085 --> 00:39:49.553
I should just shut
that smart mouth of yours.

00:39:49.553 --> 00:39:50.955
- Go on, do it.
- Hey, you...

00:39:50.955 --> 00:39:52.957
- Na Jeong.
- If you think you can, hit me.

00:39:52.957 --> 00:39:54.892
Go on. You can't hit me
because you've got no money?

00:39:54.892 --> 00:39:56.193
That's enough.

00:39:56.527 --> 00:39:57.828
Go home, both of you.

00:39:57.828 --> 00:39:58.696
Seriously.

00:39:58.696 --> 00:39:59.864
Go.

00:39:59.864 --> 00:40:01.198
- Na Jeong.
- Hit me! Why not?

00:40:01.198 --> 00:40:02.967
- Go, both of you.
- Enough.

00:40:42.139 --> 00:40:43.140
I'm sorry, Mom.

00:40:44.175 --> 00:40:45.176
But...

00:40:46.811 --> 00:40:48.879
don't watch Tae Rin anymore.

00:40:50.982 --> 00:40:52.783
Use this chance
to step back from childcare.

00:40:59.390 --> 00:41:01.692
I was the one who always had to give in.

00:41:04.528 --> 00:41:05.763
You always said,

00:41:07.098 --> 00:41:08.666
"You're the nice one, so let it go."

00:41:10.301 --> 00:41:11.836
"You're the gentle one, so let it go."

00:41:15.873 --> 00:41:17.608
I'm not that nice.

00:41:19.110 --> 00:41:20.544
I can be mean too.

00:41:24.916 --> 00:41:25.850
But...

00:41:26.684 --> 00:41:28.619
I held back
because I didn't want you to struggle.

00:41:32.623 --> 00:41:33.758
But...

00:41:35.459 --> 00:41:37.228
you're hurting the one
who stayed quiet for you,

00:41:38.362 --> 00:41:39.997
still putting up...

00:41:40.264 --> 00:41:41.966
with Jae Jeong's demands.

00:41:48.539 --> 00:41:50.841
You've had kids, so you know.

00:41:51.776 --> 00:41:53.244
Even from the same womb,

00:41:53.244 --> 00:41:55.947
one kid is difficult and one is easy.

00:41:56.614 --> 00:41:59.016
What can I do?
That's how I gave birth to you two.

00:42:03.621 --> 00:42:05.790
No one taught him,

00:42:06.390 --> 00:42:07.959
but when I put one thing
in Jae Jeong's hand,

00:42:07.959 --> 00:42:10.428
he'd cry if there wasn't
another in the other hand.

00:42:12.463 --> 00:42:14.999
But when I gave you something,

00:42:14.999 --> 00:42:17.668
you'd break it in half
and put some in my mouth and smile.

00:42:18.970 --> 00:42:20.438
No one taught you that,

00:42:20.838 --> 00:42:22.273
but you were like that as a baby.

00:42:24.942 --> 00:42:26.043
What am I supposed to do?

00:42:27.478 --> 00:42:29.914
He was demanding,
so he needed more care.

00:42:30.548 --> 00:42:33.050
You were easy,
so you needed less.

00:42:34.252 --> 00:42:35.186
Do you think...

00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:39.357
it's because I loved you any less?

00:42:41.859 --> 00:42:44.262
So what now?

00:42:45.429 --> 00:42:46.530
Are you going back?

00:42:55.072 --> 00:42:56.974
My goodness.

00:42:57.842 --> 00:42:59.944
Fine, do whatever you want.

00:43:00.478 --> 00:43:03.681
Spend your whole life
cleaning up after my picky brother,

00:43:04.548 --> 00:43:07.351
serving him until you're bent over.

00:43:07.952 --> 00:43:08.753
Okay?

00:43:27.605 --> 00:43:29.440
(Mom)

00:43:41.185 --> 00:43:42.019
Yes, Mom.

00:43:42.019 --> 00:43:45.089
Why'd you pack up
all of Sang Min's clothes?

00:43:45.923 --> 00:43:48.092
And what's with the herbal medicine
you tore open in the sink?

00:43:49.594 --> 00:43:51.128
Did you fight with Sang Min?

00:43:52.496 --> 00:43:54.098
I'll explain later.

00:43:54.465 --> 00:43:55.499
Later when?

00:43:56.234 --> 00:43:57.368
When exactly?

00:43:58.736 --> 00:43:59.670
Mom.

00:44:00.371 --> 00:44:01.839
I'm working right now.

00:44:03.107 --> 00:44:05.610
I'll explain tonight, so please hang up.

00:44:13.818 --> 00:44:14.685
Tell me.

00:44:15.653 --> 00:44:18.189
How big was the fight...

00:44:18.189 --> 00:44:19.724
that you packed up his things...

00:44:20.658 --> 00:44:23.594
and slashed open
all that expensive herbal medicine?

00:44:24.328 --> 00:44:25.196
What?

00:44:26.197 --> 00:44:29.133
Did he blame you for not getting pregnant?

00:44:29.967 --> 00:44:31.269
It's not that.

00:44:31.269 --> 00:44:32.169
Then what is it?

00:44:34.205 --> 00:44:37.008
Tell me already.
Don't make me suffocate here.

00:44:39.377 --> 00:44:40.311
We're...

00:44:40.912 --> 00:44:42.213
getting a divorce.

00:44:42.647 --> 00:44:43.981
What?

00:44:45.483 --> 00:44:46.684
Why?

00:44:46.951 --> 00:44:49.053
What's the reason?

00:45:02.166 --> 00:45:03.067
This...

00:45:03.267 --> 00:45:05.036
What is this?

00:45:05.770 --> 00:45:06.637
What is it?

00:45:06.637 --> 00:45:08.606
It's the doll Sang Min adores so much.

00:45:09.674 --> 00:45:10.508
What?

00:45:13.210 --> 00:45:14.345
That's not all.

00:45:14.845 --> 00:45:16.447
He's got a life-size doll...

00:45:16.747 --> 00:45:19.016
hidden in a semi-basement
in Jeongneung-dong,

00:45:19.283 --> 00:45:20.985
and he goes there all the time to see it.

00:45:23.521 --> 00:45:24.889
What's even crazier, Mom,

00:45:26.724 --> 00:45:28.559
is that he talks to those dolls.

00:45:30.761 --> 00:45:32.296
He takes pictures with them...

00:45:33.497 --> 00:45:34.599
and badmouths me.

00:45:35.933 --> 00:45:37.768
It turns out he was a pervert.

00:45:44.775 --> 00:45:45.643
So...

00:45:46.944 --> 00:45:48.579
you want to divorce him...

00:45:49.013 --> 00:45:50.481
over something like this?

00:45:51.515 --> 00:45:53.117
He didn't cheat.

00:45:53.884 --> 00:45:55.453
He's not gambling.

00:45:56.254 --> 00:45:57.722
He doesn't hit you.

00:45:57.722 --> 00:45:58.689
He just...

00:45:59.257 --> 00:46:01.659
has a weird hobby.

00:46:02.126 --> 00:46:04.929
You want to get divorced over this...

00:46:05.263 --> 00:46:07.198
and have everyone pointing fingers at you?

00:46:08.332 --> 00:46:09.467
Just live with it.

00:46:10.735 --> 00:46:11.535
What?

00:46:12.103 --> 00:46:15.773
Do you think divorce
is as easy as it sounds?

00:46:15.773 --> 00:46:18.509
You're better off...

00:46:18.509 --> 00:46:22.113
being a married woman on paper
than a divorcee.

00:46:22.914 --> 00:46:24.081
Do what I say.

00:46:24.649 --> 00:46:26.550
Mom, are you seriously
saying that right now?

00:46:26.550 --> 00:46:28.352
If you get divorced too,

00:46:28.352 --> 00:46:30.288
how am I supposed to face anyone?

00:46:30.288 --> 00:46:33.257
Every time someone asked
where your father went,

00:46:34.058 --> 00:46:35.927
do you know how embarrassed I was?

00:46:36.460 --> 00:46:39.030
Is your image
more important than my happiness?

00:46:40.898 --> 00:46:43.367
I have to endure all this
so you won't be embarrassed?

00:46:44.001 --> 00:46:47.338
How can you, as my mom,
worry about your reputation now?

00:46:47.338 --> 00:46:51.409
So you really want to drive a stake
straight into your mother's heart?

00:46:53.477 --> 00:46:54.912
As if I wasn't unlucky enough with men,

00:46:54.912 --> 00:46:57.148
now you want people saying
I'm unlucky with kids too?

00:46:58.015 --> 00:47:01.919
How much more do you want
to stain my name before you're satisfied?

00:47:02.286 --> 00:47:03.220
Yeah.

00:47:04.155 --> 00:47:05.756
You've always been like this, Mom.

00:47:06.857 --> 00:47:09.560
Your pride always comes
before your kids' feelings.

00:47:09.560 --> 00:47:12.096
What people think
always comes before real happiness.

00:47:12.730 --> 00:47:14.799
When I first introduced Sang Min to you,

00:47:15.466 --> 00:47:16.867
I said he was a bit odd, remember?

00:47:16.867 --> 00:47:18.869
But you said he went to a good university,
so I should marry him.

00:47:18.869 --> 00:47:20.037
Then, when we couldn't have a baby,

00:47:20.037 --> 00:47:22.940
you suddenly claimed you'd had
a bad feeling about him from the start.

00:47:24.442 --> 00:47:26.077
And now that I'm telling you
he's a pervert,

00:47:26.644 --> 00:47:28.512
you say divorce isn't an option?

00:47:28.512 --> 00:47:29.680
How can you...

00:47:30.114 --> 00:47:32.316
twist what I say for your sake...

00:47:32.316 --> 00:47:33.985
into something like that?

00:47:35.019 --> 00:47:36.587
And you call yourself a good daughter?

00:47:38.656 --> 00:47:40.625
This is going to kill me.

00:47:41.359 --> 00:47:43.194
This is going to be the death of me.

00:47:44.996 --> 00:47:46.664
Why aren't you calling 911 already?

00:47:46.664 --> 00:47:48.199
Stop putting on a show!

00:47:48.866 --> 00:47:51.836
Every time you pull this,
I feel like I'm going crazy.

00:47:53.404 --> 00:47:56.474
The second things don't go your way,
you play the victim.

00:47:57.174 --> 00:48:00.311
You gaslight me over and over
just to make me obey.

00:48:00.311 --> 00:48:03.414
That's exactly why Dad couldn't take it
and walked out.

00:48:03.414 --> 00:48:04.849
You still don't get it?

00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:11.255
Hey, Gu Joo Young!

00:48:40.918 --> 00:48:42.019
Forget it.

00:48:43.454 --> 00:48:46.991
Maybe it's just because I'm burned out.

00:48:47.458 --> 00:48:49.026
Use that energy to work out instead.

00:49:01.572 --> 00:49:02.974
Who is it?

00:49:03.908 --> 00:49:04.809
It's me.

00:49:09.413 --> 00:49:10.214
Gu Joo Young?

00:49:15.519 --> 00:49:16.387
Gu Joo Young.

00:49:19.924 --> 00:49:21.392
What brings you here at this hour?

00:49:24.929 --> 00:49:26.831
What's wrong?

00:49:28.132 --> 00:49:29.066
What happened?

00:49:42.446 --> 00:49:43.614
Here.

00:49:52.189 --> 00:49:55.860
Everyone

00:49:55.860 --> 00:49:58.696
Be good to your parents

00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:03.801
(Daughter-in-law)

00:50:13.711 --> 00:50:15.046
Mother, please have some.

00:50:17.715 --> 00:50:19.650
I said I'm fine. You didn't have to.

00:50:20.117 --> 00:50:22.753
Please don't feel pressured, Mother.

00:50:23.888 --> 00:50:26.557
All this time, I haven't even made sure
you were eating properly,

00:50:27.325 --> 00:50:29.060
and I've only been thinking about Tae Rin.

00:50:29.994 --> 00:50:31.896
I really feel bad about all that.

00:50:33.598 --> 00:50:34.465
All right, then.

00:50:35.766 --> 00:50:38.269
I'll just enjoy it with a grateful heart.

00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:51.482
You were really upset last time,
weren't you?

00:50:52.516 --> 00:50:55.386
I guess brothers and sisters
stay childish even when they're grown.

00:50:55.987 --> 00:50:57.855
I thought Na Jeong was gentle,

00:50:58.456 --> 00:51:00.091
but she's got quite a temper.

00:51:01.292 --> 00:51:02.460
I was a bit taken aback.

00:51:06.230 --> 00:51:07.131
But...

00:51:07.865 --> 00:51:08.933
have you really...

00:51:10.167 --> 00:51:11.636
made up your mind?

00:51:16.040 --> 00:51:16.941
Mother.

00:51:17.708 --> 00:51:19.710
Please think it over just once more.

00:51:20.444 --> 00:51:22.713
Like Na Jeong said,
if it's because the money isn't enough,

00:51:22.713 --> 00:51:23.848
we can raise it.

00:51:24.348 --> 00:51:25.583
But as you know,

00:51:25.583 --> 00:51:27.418
our loan interest has gone up a lot,

00:51:28.119 --> 00:51:31.422
and we still have a long way to go
on Jae Jeong's car payments.

00:51:32.023 --> 00:51:34.959
So how about we raise it
to 1,000 dollars for now?

00:51:36.627 --> 00:51:39.096
Two thousand is still a bit much
for us right now.

00:51:42.633 --> 00:51:44.368
To be honest, Mother,

00:51:45.503 --> 00:51:46.671
we're actually really struggling.

00:51:47.705 --> 00:51:49.407
Still, we're doing our best...

00:51:49.407 --> 00:51:51.509
to look like we're living decently.

00:51:52.443 --> 00:51:54.812
That's why Jae Jeong works day and night.

00:51:56.080 --> 00:51:57.481
I'd love to quit my job,

00:51:57.481 --> 00:51:59.717
but I know I shouldn't,
so I just keep going.

00:52:02.053 --> 00:52:05.156
Honestly, if we're doing well,

00:52:06.190 --> 00:52:09.026
that's what will
make you happy too, right?

00:52:09.026 --> 00:52:11.095
Are you threatening me right now?

00:52:12.063 --> 00:52:12.964
Sorry?

00:52:14.432 --> 00:52:17.101
You've really got the wrong idea.

00:52:17.935 --> 00:52:19.136
Who said...

00:52:19.136 --> 00:52:21.339
I can only be happy if you two are happy?

00:52:22.506 --> 00:52:24.408
That's not what I meant.

00:52:24.408 --> 00:52:25.543
Let me be blunt.

00:52:26.077 --> 00:52:29.080
You don't care one bit about my happiness,

00:52:29.981 --> 00:52:32.550
so why should I be responsible for yours?

00:52:33.384 --> 00:52:35.653
The more I think about it,
the more annoyed I get.

00:52:35.653 --> 00:52:37.455
Mother, that's not what I'm saying.

00:52:37.455 --> 00:52:38.356
Enough.

00:52:40.458 --> 00:52:43.639
I've heard my whole life...

00:52:43.640 --> 00:52:46.563
that sacrificing yourself
for your kids is pointless,

00:52:46.564 --> 00:52:48.579
and I still lived like that. That's on me.

00:52:50.234 --> 00:52:52.603
From now on, I'm not watching your kids,

00:52:52.603 --> 00:52:55.172
and I'm not watching Na Jeong's, either.
Just so you know.

00:52:56.073 --> 00:52:57.575
No complaints then, right?

00:52:57.808 --> 00:52:58.576
Mother.

00:53:00.444 --> 00:53:01.345
Mother.

00:53:04.415 --> 00:53:06.117
Stop laughing, Lee Il Ri.

00:53:08.319 --> 00:53:10.554
It's too funny.

00:53:11.555 --> 00:53:14.926
So all those dolls
have names ending in "-ca?"

00:53:14.926 --> 00:53:16.627
Jessica, Rebecca.

00:53:16.627 --> 00:53:19.363
Then what about you?
How about Francesca?

00:53:19.363 --> 00:53:21.265
Or Veronica?

00:53:21.265 --> 00:53:22.633
Bianca?

00:53:23.134 --> 00:53:24.068
Is this funny to you?

00:53:25.336 --> 00:53:26.589
You think this is funny?

00:53:30.007 --> 00:53:34.045
I've honestly never seen
a situation like this before.

00:53:34.045 --> 00:53:35.746
Even as Blunt Sister,

00:53:35.746 --> 00:53:37.882
I can't come up
with a clean solution for this one.

00:53:38.449 --> 00:53:40.351
Are you sure Sang Min is abnormal?

00:53:40.685 --> 00:53:44.188
I mean, he did seem
a bit socially awkward,

00:53:44.188 --> 00:53:45.723
but he seemed fine otherwise.

00:53:45.723 --> 00:53:47.391
I don't know.

00:53:48.192 --> 00:53:49.627
I'm divorcing him.

00:53:50.227 --> 00:53:52.463
But like your mother said,

00:53:52.463 --> 00:53:54.165
this is a different kind of thing.

00:53:54.165 --> 00:53:56.934
It's not exactly cheating.

00:53:57.401 --> 00:53:59.770
It feels like there's a deeper story.

00:54:00.137 --> 00:54:01.038
So?

00:54:01.472 --> 00:54:03.941
Are you going to tell me
to just put up with it, like my mom did?

00:54:04.308 --> 00:54:06.244
Keep that up, and I'm leaving.

00:54:06.544 --> 00:54:07.945
Okay.

00:54:07.945 --> 00:54:09.313
What I'm saying is,

00:54:09.313 --> 00:54:11.983
don't split everything
into "normal" and "abnormal."

00:54:11.983 --> 00:54:14.485
Just put everything on the table
and talk it out.

00:54:14.485 --> 00:54:17.355
If you think about it,
who's really normal in this world?

00:54:17.355 --> 00:54:20.625
You, too, can't stand it
when something's out of line, right?

00:54:21.058 --> 00:54:22.126
Look at this.

00:54:22.126 --> 00:54:24.729
Your buttons are done all the way up.

00:54:24.729 --> 00:54:25.730
And your hair,

00:54:26.063 --> 00:54:27.965
not a single strand out of place.

00:54:30.101 --> 00:54:33.638
True. I am a bit uptight.

00:54:34.038 --> 00:54:36.340
I don't even know
how I ended up like this.

00:54:37.341 --> 00:54:40.711
Back in drama club,
I was pretty liberal, wasn't I?

00:54:40.711 --> 00:54:41.579
You were.

00:54:43.414 --> 00:54:47.451
Back then, we were all wild little colts.

00:54:49.186 --> 00:54:50.054
Right.

00:54:50.788 --> 00:54:51.989
Did I tell you?

00:54:52.690 --> 00:54:53.724
It turns out Sang Gyu...

00:54:54.959 --> 00:54:56.794
lives right in front of my place.

00:54:57.028 --> 00:54:57.995
Seriously?

00:54:58.562 --> 00:55:00.831
Not just in the same neighborhood,
but literally right in front?

00:55:01.265 --> 00:55:02.099
Yeah.

00:55:02.700 --> 00:55:03.568
No way!

00:55:04.168 --> 00:55:05.803
Then why didn't you say anything?

00:55:05.803 --> 00:55:08.306
It didn't feel like a big deal,
so I forgot.

00:55:08.873 --> 00:55:11.442
And I didn't want you guys
trying to set me up with him.

00:55:11.442 --> 00:55:14.378
How could you forget that?

00:55:14.378 --> 00:55:16.480
Since we're on the topic,

00:55:16.480 --> 00:55:18.049
should we call him out for a drink?

00:55:18.349 --> 00:55:21.085
That's not what I was trying to tell you.

00:55:21.085 --> 00:55:22.286
Hey, Gu Joo Young!

00:55:22.286 --> 00:55:23.955
Hey, wait!

00:55:25.690 --> 00:55:26.857
Hey!

00:55:26.857 --> 00:55:29.026
If you just show up like this,
how shocked do you think he'll be?

00:55:29.026 --> 00:55:30.962
You should at least send a text first.

00:55:30.962 --> 00:55:32.563
It's fine.

00:55:32.563 --> 00:55:36.000
Why act so formal between old classmates?

00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:38.502
You told me to loosen up a little,
remember?

00:55:45.643 --> 00:55:46.510
What the...

00:55:46.877 --> 00:55:48.145
He's not home yet?

00:55:48.846 --> 00:55:51.849
Come on, let's go.
I'm still awkward around him.

00:55:52.216 --> 00:55:53.451
Joo Young?

00:55:53.451 --> 00:55:54.719
Dude.

00:55:54.719 --> 00:55:57.088
Hey, Joo Young.
What are you doing here?

00:55:57.355 --> 00:55:58.823
Are you hanging out at Il Ri's place?

00:55:58.823 --> 00:56:00.558
Dude, come on.

00:56:00.558 --> 00:56:03.094
I honestly had no idea you lived here.

00:56:03.761 --> 00:56:05.696
I'm sleeping over tonight,

00:56:06.230 --> 00:56:07.565
so how about we grab a drink?

00:56:09.200 --> 00:56:10.067
Right now?

00:56:17.875 --> 00:56:19.010
What?

00:56:19.010 --> 00:56:20.811
I'm telling you, it's true.

00:56:20.811 --> 00:56:22.546
Back on stage that time,

00:56:22.546 --> 00:56:24.649
you secretly farted.

00:56:24.649 --> 00:56:25.516
What is this?

00:56:26.117 --> 00:56:27.885
What is even going on right now?

00:56:28.653 --> 00:56:30.521
Byeon Sang Gyu, what is this?

00:56:30.922 --> 00:56:32.690
Is he sulking
because of what I said earlier?

00:56:33.424 --> 00:56:35.960
Or is he really just not interested?

00:56:36.494 --> 00:56:39.363
You know, back in school,
you were so prim and proper.

00:56:39.363 --> 00:56:41.032
But tonight, you're all bubbly.

00:56:41.032 --> 00:56:42.199
What changed you?

00:56:42.199 --> 00:56:43.167
Really?

00:56:43.568 --> 00:56:45.603
Am I fine tonight?

00:56:46.771 --> 00:56:48.940
Gu Joo Young, what are you doing?

00:56:48.940 --> 00:56:49.907
Are you drunk?

00:56:51.108 --> 00:56:54.078
She had two bottles of wine at my place,

00:56:54.078 --> 00:56:55.980
so I think her guard's a little down.

00:56:55.980 --> 00:56:57.848
So what? She's adorable.

00:56:57.848 --> 00:57:00.151
My gosh, am I adorable?

00:57:00.151 --> 00:57:01.018
Yeah.

00:57:01.018 --> 00:57:04.455
I've never been called adorable
in my entire life.

00:57:05.289 --> 00:57:08.859
I didn't know
you could be this sweet, Sang Gyu.

00:57:09.327 --> 00:57:11.362
He's kind of irresistible,
don't you think?

00:57:11.662 --> 00:57:12.463
You think so?

00:57:12.730 --> 00:57:14.765
I guess you must be
in a really good mood tonight, Joo Young.

00:57:14.765 --> 00:57:16.400
You're handing out a lot of compliments.

00:57:16.400 --> 00:57:17.268
Thanks.

00:57:18.536 --> 00:57:19.837
No.

00:57:19.837 --> 00:57:21.806
Back in school, I never noticed,

00:57:21.806 --> 00:57:26.344
but you really have a way
of making people feel good.

00:57:27.278 --> 00:57:28.179
But, hey.

00:57:28.846 --> 00:57:30.881
Do you have a girlfriend?

00:57:31.349 --> 00:57:33.517
You seem like you'd be really popular.

00:57:35.186 --> 00:57:37.188
Well, what do you think?

00:57:37.521 --> 00:57:39.690
Come on.

00:57:39.690 --> 00:57:43.027
Don't tease. Just tell me already.

00:57:43.694 --> 00:57:44.862
I don't have anyone.

00:57:45.830 --> 00:57:46.797
Why not?

00:57:47.064 --> 00:57:48.199
No way.

00:57:49.100 --> 00:57:51.469
Then what's your type?

00:57:52.870 --> 00:57:55.573
It's nothing specific.

00:57:57.008 --> 00:57:59.176
Someone upbeat and confident is nice.

00:57:59.410 --> 00:58:01.579
Who? Me?

00:58:01.579 --> 00:58:04.348
But you know,
being too childish is a turnoff.

00:58:05.683 --> 00:58:08.753
Then what about a divorcee?

00:58:09.587 --> 00:58:12.056
There's nothing wrong with that
as long as she's a good person.

00:58:13.291 --> 00:58:15.660
Gu Joo Young, you're way too drunk.

00:58:15.660 --> 00:58:16.694
Stop drinking.

00:58:18.696 --> 00:58:21.332
If I don't drink now, when will I?

00:58:21.332 --> 00:58:24.635
It feels amazing to be drunk
for the first time in three years.

00:58:25.836 --> 00:58:27.638
Hey, you know what?

00:58:27.638 --> 00:58:29.674
How many fingers am I holding up?

00:58:29.674 --> 00:58:30.541
One?

00:58:30.841 --> 00:58:31.909
You're completely gone.

00:58:31.909 --> 00:58:33.678
Totally hammered.

00:58:33.678 --> 00:58:36.247
Hey, stop talking nonsense.

00:58:36.881 --> 00:58:38.883
Have some water and sober up.

00:58:39.317 --> 00:58:40.985
Why are you acting like this?

00:58:40.985 --> 00:58:42.453
You're the one who told me...

00:58:42.453 --> 00:58:44.956
to loosen up and break out of the mold.

00:58:46.724 --> 00:58:49.760
Sang Gyu, what do you really think of me?

00:58:50.561 --> 00:58:51.829
Because honestly,

00:58:52.430 --> 00:58:54.899
I'm about to be a free woman soon.

00:58:56.701 --> 00:58:58.502
Joo Young, I'm really grateful.

00:58:59.437 --> 00:59:00.304
But I'm sorry.

00:59:01.472 --> 00:59:02.473
Why?

00:59:02.807 --> 00:59:04.609
Am I that unattractive?

00:59:04.609 --> 00:59:06.777
No, it's not that.

00:59:08.646 --> 00:59:09.513
It's just...

00:59:10.014 --> 00:59:12.283
I already like someone.

00:59:13.084 --> 00:59:14.118
Seriously?

00:59:14.852 --> 00:59:15.853
Who?

00:59:19.090 --> 00:59:20.291
(BPM 131)

00:59:23.828 --> 00:59:24.729
Deputy Editor.

00:59:28.266 --> 00:59:30.401
Hi, Deputy Editor!
What a surprise running into you here.

00:59:32.937 --> 00:59:34.939
This is my usual spot.

00:59:35.740 --> 00:59:37.675
Manager Eom must've brought you here.

01:00:14.979 --> 01:00:17.014
Mom, I heard from my sister-in-law.

01:00:17.014 --> 01:00:18.049
You did the right thing.

01:00:18.049 --> 01:00:19.750
Stop worrying about us now.

01:00:19.750 --> 01:00:21.852
Go travel and have fun.

01:00:21.852 --> 01:00:23.454
And sign up for those barista classes...

01:00:23.454 --> 01:00:25.790
or flower arranging lessons
you always wanted.

01:00:26.290 --> 01:00:28.826
(Mi Ja)

01:00:29.827 --> 01:00:30.828
Yeah.

01:00:30.828 --> 01:00:33.364
They say mothers with sons
die at the kitchen sink,

01:00:33.364 --> 01:00:35.733
and mothers with daughters
die on airplanes.

01:00:35.733 --> 01:00:36.901
That sounds about right.

01:00:37.735 --> 01:00:39.804
Thanks to you,
we're finally getting spoiled.

01:00:40.438 --> 01:00:41.672
What is that supposed to mean?

01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:43.975
Didn't you ask Na Jeong...

01:00:43.975 --> 01:00:45.309
to look into travel packages?

01:00:46.210 --> 01:00:47.078
What?

01:00:48.579 --> 01:00:51.015
Hello? This is Na Jeong.

01:00:51.015 --> 01:00:53.918
Aunt Mi Ja, it's nothing big, but...

01:00:53.918 --> 01:00:55.920
She called me...

01:00:56.254 --> 01:00:58.356
saying she heard we were going on a trip,

01:00:58.356 --> 01:01:00.625
and that her home shopping channel
just launched a great travel package.

01:01:00.625 --> 01:01:01.692
She wanted to connect us.

01:01:03.394 --> 01:01:04.595
Excuse me, Manager.

01:01:05.162 --> 01:01:08.165
This package is so good.

01:01:08.165 --> 01:01:12.103
I'd really like to send my mother
and her friends on the trip.

01:01:12.103 --> 01:01:13.738
Is early sign-up possible?

01:01:13.738 --> 01:01:14.639
Yes, it is.

01:01:15.573 --> 01:01:18.709
Great, then I'll contact you
through MD Choi.

01:01:18.709 --> 01:01:21.145
And if you need a discount,
should I check?

01:01:21.145 --> 01:01:23.347
That would be wonderful. Thank you.

01:01:24.148 --> 01:01:27.118
So I just assumed you'd asked her.

01:01:27.785 --> 01:01:31.055
Then did Na Jeong set this up
as a surprise behind your back?

01:01:33.524 --> 01:01:34.759
Why did you do that?

01:01:34.759 --> 01:01:35.960
Isn't it obvious?

01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:38.729
I wanted to break you out
of your invisible prison,

01:01:38.729 --> 01:01:40.464
so I thought of a way.

01:01:40.464 --> 01:01:41.766
Once you free me,

01:01:42.466 --> 01:01:44.402
what happens to your kids?

01:01:44.402 --> 01:01:45.403
Who am I?

01:01:45.403 --> 01:01:46.938
I'm your daughter, Cho Na Jeong.

01:01:46.938 --> 01:01:48.973
I took care of everything.

01:01:51.142 --> 01:01:52.877
I'm coming.

01:01:56.714 --> 01:01:57.715
Father?

01:02:02.420 --> 01:02:03.254
Here.

01:02:04.455 --> 01:02:06.390
Won Bin called me.

01:02:06.724 --> 01:02:10.127
He said once my leg heals,
he'll need my help for a while.

01:02:10.127 --> 01:02:12.697
He said that you're really
having a hard time.

01:02:12.697 --> 01:02:14.265
I see.

01:02:14.265 --> 01:02:15.633
Thank you, Father.

01:02:16.534 --> 01:02:18.369
And also...

01:02:18.369 --> 01:02:19.170
Yes?

01:02:19.604 --> 01:02:21.939
This singing class
the district office runs...

01:02:21.939 --> 01:02:23.908
seems to be really famous.

01:02:24.542 --> 01:02:26.978
So no matter what,
make sure I can go there...

01:02:26.978 --> 01:02:28.246
during the day.

01:02:28.412 --> 01:02:30.014
Of course, Father.

01:02:31.015 --> 01:02:32.149
And one more thing.

01:02:32.483 --> 01:02:35.152
I'm great at playing with the kids,

01:02:35.486 --> 01:02:36.420
but not with studying.

01:02:36.787 --> 01:02:39.490
I really can't teach that,
just so you know.

01:02:39.924 --> 01:02:42.126
Absolutely, Father.

01:02:42.126 --> 01:02:43.060
Good.

01:02:43.761 --> 01:02:45.329
- All right, then.
- Please drink.

01:02:48.332 --> 01:02:51.068
Don't worry and just have fun.

01:02:55.840 --> 01:02:57.408
People say...

01:02:57.408 --> 01:03:01.779
a working mom survives
on the knees of three women.

01:03:01.779 --> 01:03:04.081
Her own mother, a nanny,

01:03:04.482 --> 01:03:06.484
- and her mother-in-law.
- Soon Im.

01:03:06.484 --> 01:03:07.852
I was no different.

01:03:09.420 --> 01:03:10.521
Hey.

01:03:10.521 --> 01:03:12.857
You're all dressed up today.

01:03:12.857 --> 01:03:14.625
From behind, you look like a young lady.

01:03:14.625 --> 01:03:17.128
Do I look okay?

01:03:17.128 --> 01:03:19.497
Did anyone ask for your number?

01:03:19.497 --> 01:03:21.332
It looks like she'd give it if they did.

01:03:21.332 --> 01:03:22.700
Girl, you're going to get married
at this rate.

01:03:23.267 --> 01:03:24.569
Come on, let's go.

01:03:24.569 --> 01:03:25.970
Don't be ridiculous.

01:03:25.970 --> 01:03:27.338
Let's go. We'll be late.

01:03:27.338 --> 01:03:29.073
- Yeah, let's go.
- You lead.

01:03:29.073 --> 01:03:30.474
Maybe the world...

01:03:30.808 --> 01:03:33.177
is running on the backs...

01:03:33.177 --> 01:03:34.645
of mothers like these.

01:03:35.413 --> 01:03:36.447
But...

01:03:36.447 --> 01:03:38.783
just because it can't be helped
doesn't mean it's right.

01:03:39.850 --> 01:03:41.919
We must never forget.

01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:44.422
Before they were our mothers,

01:03:44.422 --> 01:03:46.023
they were women...

01:03:46.924 --> 01:03:48.359
with their own desires...

01:03:48.359 --> 01:03:50.561
and their own lives to live.

01:03:57.068 --> 01:03:58.636
- Honey.
- Honey.

01:03:58.636 --> 01:03:59.737
Are you heading out to prep
for the night broadcast?

01:03:59.737 --> 01:04:01.305
Yeah. You finished your show, right?

01:04:01.606 --> 01:04:03.341
You should hurry and go help Father.

01:04:04.075 --> 01:04:06.510
Right. He loves fried chicken.

01:04:06.510 --> 01:04:07.578
Pick some up on your way.

01:04:07.812 --> 01:04:08.713
Okay.

01:04:08.713 --> 01:04:09.614
- Good luck.
- You too.

01:04:11.916 --> 01:04:14.719
I'm picking up fried chicken now,
so don't feed the kids dinner.

01:04:15.753 --> 01:04:17.421
Yes, I'll be right there.

01:04:26.397 --> 01:04:27.198
Okay.

01:04:28.733 --> 01:04:29.634
Yes, that's me.

01:04:36.841 --> 01:04:37.675
What?

01:04:39.577 --> 01:04:42.747
(Operating Room)

01:05:04.368 --> 01:05:05.236
Producer Noh.

01:05:06.771 --> 01:05:08.639
Thank you for everything.

01:05:10.575 --> 01:05:12.543
Please forgive me...

01:05:13.377 --> 01:05:15.012
for only being able to go this far.

01:05:34.832 --> 01:05:38.236
(From Seon Min)

01:06:57.515 --> 01:06:59.650
(Don't call me ma'am)

01:07:00.518 --> 01:07:03.421
They say that woman
called Seon Min took pills...

01:07:03.421 --> 01:07:04.922
because of your husband.

01:07:04.922 --> 01:07:06.057
My husband?

01:07:06.057 --> 01:07:07.258
Honestly, it's better this way.

01:07:07.825 --> 01:07:08.826
If we'd had a kid,

01:07:08.826 --> 01:07:10.261
divorce wouldn't be this easy.

01:07:11.028 --> 01:07:12.463
I have something to tell you too.

01:07:12.463 --> 01:07:14.231
Hey, guys.

01:07:14.732 --> 01:07:16.334
I still love you, Il Ri.

01:07:16.334 --> 01:07:18.069
I'll break up with So Young.

01:07:18.069 --> 01:07:19.403
So you break up with that jerk too,

01:07:20.438 --> 01:07:21.572
and marry me.

01:07:22.506 --> 01:07:25.376
Don't you feel even a little sorry
for Na Jeong waiting at home?

01:07:25.376 --> 01:07:26.844
What, are you mad?

01:07:27.345 --> 01:07:29.880
You cheated with another woman,
got caught by everyone,

01:07:29.880 --> 01:07:32.183
and you can't even explain yourself.

01:07:32.183 --> 01:07:33.050
Let's end it.

01:07:33.918 --> 01:07:35.286
I don't want to live with you, either.

01:07:38.923 --> 01:07:40.925
