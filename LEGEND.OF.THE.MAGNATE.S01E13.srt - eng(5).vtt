[Legend of the Magnate]

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.000
[Episode 13]

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:48.479
You're awake.

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:51.430
If it weren't for

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:52.789
my quick reflexes,

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.210
you would've been trampled to death.

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:58.020
In the end, I just got beaten for nothing.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:00.150
Pingwen.

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:01.840
Where are we going?

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.120
Are you stupid?

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:04.390
We're going home.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:05.510
We're beaten up this badly.

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:06.770
Where else could we go?

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.400
It wasn't easy escaping that place.

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:10.870
Stop, I'm getting off.

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.680
I need to return to the camp.

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.190
What are you going back to the camp for?

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:15.360
With all this chaos,

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.070
people get trampled

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:17.590
like they're nothing but ants.

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:18.310
Several people

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:19.960
were trampled to death back there,

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.890
and no one even knows who they were.

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.890
I'd be a fool to trust you again...

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:29.500
Pingyuan.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:30.160
Pingyuan!

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.010
What are you doing? Are you crazy?

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:34.900
Yimei is still in the military camp.

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.430
Those women are still in the camp.

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:37.120
I need to bring them back.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.150
They can't come back, Pingyuan.

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.030
They can't return.

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.840
That's a military camp.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:40.630
Who do you think you are?

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:41.750
Then what should we do?

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.010
Watch them die?

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:45.690
Many people have already died!

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.030
Just now, you and I

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.160
almost died!

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.840
If we die,

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.100
no one would even know.

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:52.590
No one should die in vain.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.790
No one.

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:55.870
If I can't even protect

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.520
the women and children of the village,

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.120
can I still call myself a man?

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:00.370
Out of my way!

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.130
Don't stop me.

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.960
Why are you trying to be a hero,
Gu Pingyuan?

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:11.950
You just talk big.

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.160
I may be a coward,

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.460
but at least I take care of our mother!

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:18.110
You!

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:19.120
You were gone for so many years,

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.250
Mother's eyes went blind from crying!

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:22.590
When the soldiers came,

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:23.590
she hid in the stove

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.590
and survived on sweet potato scraps
for 3 days and 3 nights.

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:26.630
I hid on the beam

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:27.870
and nearly starved to death.

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.520
Where were you when that happened?

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:30.079
Why didn't you

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:31.520
say that back then?

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.190
Now you're finally back,

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.300
and you're already leaving!

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.840
What do you take us

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:39.800
for?

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.620
If our commanding general dies today,

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.550
none of you will make it back alive!

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:05.150
Hurry!

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.050
How is the commanding general?

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:09.240
He's still bleeding.

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:10.520
Save the general, quickly!

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:11.000
Hurry up!

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.430
You,

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.380
go get a cloth to cover his face.

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.520
He's not dead. Why cover his face?

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:16.370
I'm scared.

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.100
Here, General.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:28.720
Hurry up!

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.000
Alright.

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:33.970
Go get

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.470
a sharp knife, alcohol, wound medicine,

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:37.270
and a brazier.

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:38.070
Okay.

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:39.270
Quick!

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:39.920
The brazier!

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:40.850
Alcohol! Hurry!

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:53.130
Li Cheng!

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.000
Tell Li Cheng to come out!

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:58.270
I need to see him!

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:01.240
Li Cheng!

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:19.290
General.

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:28.450
I need to dig out the iron sand

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:29.180
in his wound.

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:30.510
You need to hold him down.

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:31.310
Alright.

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:40.700
I told you to hold him down!
What were you doing?

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:41.680
The iron sand will sink deeper

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:42.490
into his wound like this.

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:44.090
If I can't get it out, can you?

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:44.680
Yes.

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:45.240
Come.

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:46.159
Come quickly.

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:31.690
I'll pull out the arrow for you.

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:32.150
No.

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:34.180
He'll die if you do.

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:37.150
We must remove the arrow's body,

00:06:37.159 --> 00:06:38.800
slowly push the arrowhead out,

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:41.060
and sew the wound up
with lamb intestine.

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:00.950
Water.

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:04.830
Water...

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:37.090
You've lost a lot of blood.

00:07:37.159 --> 00:07:38.650
You can't drink too much water.

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:39.980
Just moisten your lips.

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:25.930
Look, he's much better.

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:28.430
He really does look much better.

00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:29.040
Yes.

00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:32.409
You're really something.

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:45.000
I think he'll be fine now.

00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:46.440
General, moving on,

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:47.440
you need to eat well

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:48.900
to build up your strength.

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:49.560
I think...

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:52.210
You'll recover in a month or so.

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:06.210
This...

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:07.300
What are you doing?

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:08.360
The general values this

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:09.200
like his own eyes.

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:10.870
You're just writing on it like that?

00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:11.630
If he's dead,

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.120
what good are his eyes?

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:13.580
Well...

00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:32.370
[Angelica sinensis, Dipsacus asper 1 tael,

3 taels, Deer antler 0.5 tael]

00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:34.080
Get medicine according to
this prescription.

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:35.890
Take it once a day,
and his fever will subside in 3 days.

00:09:35.890 --> 00:09:37.030
His heart and lungs will then be safe.

00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:37.600
Alright.

00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:42.160
Let's go.

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:43.080
Come on.

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:43.980
Those women...

00:09:46.390 --> 00:09:48.190
You didn't kill anyone, did you?

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:49.580
What do you take us for?

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:51.420
We don't raise our weapons

00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:53.110
against defenseless women.

00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:53.880
Don't worry.

00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:55.370
We didn't hurt any of them.

00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:04.000
What are you doing?

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:06.570
I'm going back too.

00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:07.720
You can't leave.

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:10.210
Only when the arrow is removed

00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:11.510
and he's up and about,

00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:13.220
will your life be fully saved.

00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:14.780
Watch him carefully.

00:10:52.390 --> 00:10:54.670
Who taught you your medical skills?

00:10:57.270 --> 00:10:58.670
I learned from my father.

00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:00.860
When I recover,

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:02.670
I will reward you generously.

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:07.780
Tell me about your father.

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:09.840
What kind of person is he?

00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:14.750
My father is a scholar

00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:17.550
who never passed the imperial exams.

00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:18.500
He said,

00:11:19.510 --> 00:11:20.970
"If not a famous minister,

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:22.760
then a renowned doctor."

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:25.150
Later, he stopped taking exams

00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:26.910
and became a teacher in the village.

00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:27.910
He opened a school

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:29.440
to teach the kids

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:31.510
and studied medicine himself.

00:11:31.510 --> 00:11:33.440
Tell your father to stop teaching.

00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:35.810
All that Confucius and Mencius stuff

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:37.360
is useless anyway.

00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:39.900
Come to my army

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:41.390
and be a doctor.

00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:46.350
Have you ever been educated?

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:51.600
People who are educated
and understand principles

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:52.730
would never do this.

00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:54.440
Because of your war,

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:56.270
we couldn't sell our tea

00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:57.640
or bring in supplies.

00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:00.370
Men live in fear of being drafted.

00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:02.720
When the tea forest was burned down,

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:04.920
the whole village cried for a whole day.

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:07.120
But no one came to help.

00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:24.040
Drink the medicine.

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:25.210
Just leave it there.

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:27.200
If you don't take the medicine,

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:28.770
they won't let us leave.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:42.550
It's hot.

00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:00.790
I'm done.

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:06.200
What's your name?

00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:08.600
My name is Bai Yimei.

00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:15.280
Fitting name for your heartlessness.

00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:25.700
What happened?

00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:27.010
There was a big explosion!

00:15:27.010 --> 00:15:28.000
Is everyone all right?

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:28.480
We're fine.

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:29.340
What happened?

00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:30.240
Guards!

00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:32.920
Yes, sir.

00:15:33.130 --> 00:15:34.000
It's not an enemy attack!

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:34.440
Yimei.

00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:36.160
Come, help me untie this.

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:36.730
General!

00:15:36.750 --> 00:15:38.880
The explosives in the hay barn blew up.

00:15:42.010 --> 00:15:42.600
No!

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:43.510
No!

00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:52.500
Put your weapons away.

00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:53.390
General.

00:15:54.270 --> 00:15:55.510
Get up and speak.

00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:02.610
So you're still alive.

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:05.530
We still have business to discuss.

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:08.790
You set off those explosives?

00:16:08.790 --> 00:16:10.320
Clever move.

00:16:12.950 --> 00:16:15.210
What's your relationship with Miss Bai?

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:20.140
We are engaged.

00:16:24.510 --> 00:16:26.200
You trespassed into my military camp.

00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:27.550
That's a capital offense.

00:16:27.550 --> 00:16:28.360
But considering

00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:29.960
what Miss Bai has done for me,

00:16:30.630 --> 00:16:31.780
I'll let you go.

00:16:32.390 --> 00:16:32.870
Go.

00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:35.960
If I wanted to leave,
I would have left already.

00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:36.790
I came here to take

00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:38.030
all those prisoners with me.

00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:39.270
General, let's just kill him.

00:16:39.270 --> 00:16:40.670
Don't waste words on him.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:41.720
Fine.

00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:44.960
Let's continue our business discussion.

00:16:45.950 --> 00:16:47.320
Besides those hemp ropes,

00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:48.870
I can also supply you with tung oil.

00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:49.690
Tung oil?

00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:50.550
How much?

00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:52.550
If I gather all the tung oil in Huizhou,

00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:54.550
there would be at least
several thousand barrels.

00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:56.240
I'll sell you hemp ropes and tung oil.

00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:58.370
In exchange, release all those women.

00:16:58.790 --> 00:17:00.620
Are you really not a spy?

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:02.150
Whether I'm a spy or not

00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:03.080
doesn't matter anymore.

00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:04.030
As long as the hemp ropes
and tung oil are real,

00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:05.359
isn't that good enough?

00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:08.710
You make a good point.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:11.680
All right.

00:17:12.349 --> 00:17:13.400
As for the payment,

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:15.460
I won't short you a single candareen.

00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:17.410
I'll release all those women, too.

00:17:17.829 --> 00:17:18.589
However...

00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:21.210
If you and I do business,

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:22.829
what will you do if the government

00:17:22.829 --> 00:17:25.089
accuses you of colluding with the enemy?

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:26.220
It doesn't matter.

00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:30.040
I'd be the only one guilty of it.

00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:31.880
It's a small price to pay

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:33.700
for saving so many people.

00:17:34.550 --> 00:17:37.000
Risking your life for a business deal?

00:17:37.310 --> 00:17:38.720
Are you a fool?

00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:41.440
Business always requires investment.

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:43.270
Sometimes a life is also part of the cost.

00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:44.470
I can keep my promise.

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:46.380
I hope you will, too, General.

00:17:47.550 --> 00:17:49.100
They're not related to you.

00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:50.200
Is it worth it?

00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:52.350
Whether it's worth it
isn't for you to decide.

00:17:52.350 --> 00:17:53.590
It's what I think that matters.

00:17:53.590 --> 00:17:54.390
Brother Gu...

00:17:58.830 --> 00:17:59.510
Fine.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.250
Let this man go.

00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:04.080
Let those women go too.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.030
Except Miss Bai.

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:07.250
Yes, sir.

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:08.960
Li Cheng?

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:09.680
Take him away.

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:10.300
Li Cheng!

00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:11.900
I mean all women,

00:18:12.270 --> 00:18:13.110
including Bai Yimei!

00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:13.640
Gu!

00:18:13.790 --> 00:18:14.520
Li Cheng!

00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:16.000
You broke your promise.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:16.680
Li Cheng!

00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:20.160
When I recover,

00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:22.880
I'll let you go.

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:42.920
Father.

00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:43.920
Father.

00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:49.200
Mother, I'm here.

00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:02.110
My child.

00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:09.950
I finally see you all again.

00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:34.480
Sir.

00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:37.080
Yimei is

00:19:39.390 --> 00:19:41.590
treating someone at the military camp.

00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:43.030
It will be a few days

00:19:43.030 --> 00:19:44.630
before we can bring her back.

00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:49.620
My daughter-in-law.

00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:53.540
You scared me to death.

00:19:55.950 --> 00:19:57.510
I'm fine.

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:00.930
As long as I'm still breathing,

00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:03.210
I will protect her with my life.

00:20:03.550 --> 00:20:04.880
Please don't be too sad.

00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:11.240
Better to be a dog in peaceful times

00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:13.280
than a human in chaotic times.

00:20:16.770 --> 00:20:18.980
I wish I were dead!

00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:23.210
I wish...

00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:24.510
I were dead.

00:20:59.010 --> 00:21:00.080
Pingyuan, please don't be angry

00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:00.670
anymore, okay?

00:21:00.670 --> 00:21:01.640
Look, after that,

00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:02.270
I gathered my courage

00:21:02.270 --> 00:21:03.110
and went back
to the military camp to find you.

00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:04.350
Look how badly they beat me.

00:21:04.350 --> 00:21:04.720
[Blessings and Auspiciousness]

00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:05.770
Pingyuan, please don't tell Mother

00:21:05.770 --> 00:21:06.830
that we had a fight.

00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:07.750
Why don't you hit me instead?

00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:08.550
I won't fight back.

00:21:08.550 --> 00:21:10.210
Just leave me alone, will you?

00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:12.310
What's with all that noise outside?

00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:14.430
Pingyuan, are you back?

00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:16.370
Don't tell Mother where I went.

00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:17.510
Mom, I'm back.

00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:29.040
Mom, I'm back.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:31.750
Mom.

00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:35.680
Son, you're finally back.

00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:37.640
You really had me worried sick.

00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:40.590
Your brother said you've been

00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:42.720
in the city doing business these days.

00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:43.880
I told him you just got back home

00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:45.310
and haven't even settled in yet.

00:21:45.310 --> 00:21:47.190
What business could you possibly have?

00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:48.760
A friend of mine in town

00:21:49.110 --> 00:21:50.590
asked me to get him some hemp rope,

00:21:50.590 --> 00:21:51.720
tung oil, and stuff.

00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:53.720
I thought I could earn some money

00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:54.510
and use it to renovate

00:21:54.510 --> 00:21:55.270
our house.

00:21:56.070 --> 00:21:57.540
With all this chaos,

00:21:57.750 --> 00:21:59.540
it's hard to get a good friend.

00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:00.470
Who is he?

00:22:00.830 --> 00:22:02.030
You should invite him

00:22:02.030 --> 00:22:03.230
to visit us sometime.

00:22:06.510 --> 00:22:07.310
He's called

00:22:08.670 --> 00:22:09.580
Li Cheng.

00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:10.820
He's, uh,

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:11.800
from Guangxi.

00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:13.840
He just arrived in Anhui, too.

00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:15.400
He's very hospitable,

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:16.140
so

00:22:16.350 --> 00:22:18.010
he kept me there for a few days.

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:20.480
You're trying to fool me.

00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:25.040
You shouldn't charge money
for helping a friend.

00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:27.040
We must keep our hearts righteous.

00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:29.330
I'm not lying to you.

00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:31.480
We're doing business together.

00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:32.880
I'm not costing him much.

00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:35.260
My son is going to have a better life.

00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:37.200
Our family

00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:38.850
is going to prosper.

00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:42.960
Mom.

00:22:43.550 --> 00:22:45.210
Let me tell you more good news.

00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:46.480
All the women in the village

00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:47.610
have been released.

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:49.190
But Yimei

00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:51.160
needs to stay in town for a few more days.

00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:52.350
She needs to treat someone.

00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:53.240
When she returns,

00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:55.030
I'll have her come
pay her respects to you.

00:22:55.030 --> 00:22:55.790
Then you should quickly

00:22:55.790 --> 00:22:57.240
go tell Mr. Bai.

00:22:57.540 --> 00:22:58.240
Mother.

00:22:58.270 --> 00:23:00.310
We've already told Mr. Bai.

00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:03.680
In the past few years,

00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:05.330
Yimei

00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:07.300
has visited us the most.

00:23:07.510 --> 00:23:09.390
See the gown I'm wearing

00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:11.310
and Pingwen's shoes?

00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:12.580
She made them all.

00:23:14.590 --> 00:23:16.040
You must treat her well,

00:23:16.510 --> 00:23:17.770
or I won't stand for it.

00:23:18.550 --> 00:23:19.550
What are you saying?

00:23:19.550 --> 00:23:20.640
I wouldn't dare mistreat her.

00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:21.970
Please have some water.

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:23.800
Oh, Mom.

00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:24.810
This afternoon, Pingyuan and I

00:23:24.810 --> 00:23:25.950
need to go out again.

00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:27.270
We ordered 200 tea seedlings

00:23:27.270 --> 00:23:28.230
that we need to bring back.

00:23:28.230 --> 00:23:28.680
Oh, right.

00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:29.880
Time waits for no one.

00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:31.790
Once we bring them back,
we need to plant them right away.

00:23:31.790 --> 00:23:33.110
We're trying to harvest another batch

00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:34.840
before the Qingming Festival.

00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:37.460
I'm really getting old.

00:23:38.790 --> 00:23:40.920
I've always thought of you two as kids.

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:44.000
But in the blink of an eye,

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:45.860
you've both grown into young men.

00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:48.820
Just keep thinking of us that way.

00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:50.110
No matter when,

00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:51.750
Pingwen and I will always be

00:23:51.750 --> 00:23:52.750
kids in your eyes.

00:24:21.030 --> 00:24:22.690
These are blades and needles.

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:25.430
Wipe them clean with alcohol

00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:27.110
and sterilize them with fire before use.

00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:28.970
I haven't used them in a long time.

00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:31.640
These hands of mine

00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:32.790
sometimes shake terribly.

00:24:32.790 --> 00:24:34.320
I won't need these anymore.

Yimei knows

00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:38.370
what they're used for.

00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:42.270
If anything is missing, just tell me,

I'll find it.

Let your disciples handle the work.

00:24:45.510 --> 00:24:47.170
You have plenty of disciples.

00:24:47.310 --> 00:24:48.040
Don't worry.

00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:49.750

00:24:53.830 --> 00:24:55.490
Though I have good disciples,

00:24:56.110 --> 00:24:57.840
they're all busy with farming.

00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:02.790
I am a useless teacher.

00:25:06.550 --> 00:25:07.610
Tao Yuanming said,

"Trapped by the demands
of the mundane world,

30 years have gone past in an instant."

Who says you must be an official

00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:14.440
to achieve something in life?

00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:16.580
Some old sayings need to be changed.

00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:19.120
After bringing Yimei back,

00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:20.160
I plan to properly

00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:21.960
reorganize the tea plantation.

00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:23.350
Earlier this afternoon, Pingwen and I

00:25:23.350 --> 00:25:25.120
bought some tea seedlings back.

00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:27.320
No matter who's fighting in this world,

00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:29.790
people will always
need to drink tea, right?

00:25:29.790 --> 00:25:30.790
Just wait and see.

00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:36.360
I have an old friend who roasts tea

00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:38.680
in Zhonghe Village on the mountain
across from here.

00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:39.750
His surname is Liao.

00:25:39.750 --> 00:25:41.310
You can invite him over.

00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:43.480
Your mother and Pingwen once met him

00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:45.410
when he came to roast tea years ago.

00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:46.280
That's great.

00:25:46.350 --> 00:25:47.640
I've been wanting to learn tea roasting.

00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:49.300
I could take him as my teacher.

00:25:50.350 --> 00:25:51.900
Liao is quite stubborn.

00:25:52.110 --> 00:25:53.550
If I don't keep an eye on things,

00:25:53.550 --> 00:25:55.160
I'm afraid he won't teach you at all.

00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:57.510
Speaking of which,
with these years of war,

00:25:57.510 --> 00:25:59.830
Liao hasn't come to roast tea
in a long while.

00:25:59.830 --> 00:26:00.400
Oh well.

00:26:01.310 --> 00:26:02.770
If he refuses to teach you,

00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:04.960
I'll take this walking stick

00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:07.220
and give him a good whack on his backside.

00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:19.370
Can you bear it?

00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:21.400
Does it hurt a lot?

00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:23.710
It should have been pulled out long ago.

00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:29.340
We need medicine for this.

00:26:29.350 --> 00:26:31.790
First, we need to remove
the flesh around it.

00:26:31.790 --> 00:26:33.390
If we pull it out carelessly,

00:26:33.790 --> 00:26:34.920
blood will gush out,

00:26:35.350 --> 00:26:36.950
and you'll be beyond saving.

00:26:37.270 --> 00:26:38.720
Come on, pull it out.

00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:49.290
I'm going to pull it out now.

00:26:49.290 --> 00:26:51.090
Do you want something to bite on?

00:26:51.310 --> 00:26:52.240
If I'm afraid of pain,

00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:53.830
how could I lead troops into battle?

00:26:53.830 --> 00:26:54.490
Pull it out.

00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:39.530
Don't panic.

00:27:40.070 --> 00:27:42.200
It doesn't matter if I die
under treatment.

00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:43.180
I've already told my men

00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:43.830
what to do.

00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:46.080
No matter what happens,

00:27:46.110 --> 00:27:47.580
they will take you home.

00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:54.000
Don't move.

00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:56.550
If your wound remains closed

00:27:56.550 --> 00:27:58.540
by dawn, you'll be fine.

00:28:10.790 --> 00:28:12.000
It's the first time

00:28:13.270 --> 00:28:15.600
I've felt breathing could be so pleasant.

00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:20.200
Breathing is naturally pleasant.

00:28:21.230 --> 00:28:24.410
Eating, sunbathing, and drinking tea.

00:28:24.910 --> 00:28:26.570
They're all pleasant things.

00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:29.210
I really don't understand.

00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:31.180
Heaven created humans

00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:33.510
and grew crops on the earth.

00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:35.110
The crops produced fruits

00:28:35.110 --> 00:28:36.710
to satisfy people's hunger,

00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:37.960
and grew cotton

00:28:38.590 --> 00:28:39.720
to keep people warm.

00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:42.250
Why then do people
have to kill each other?

00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:46.740
You're a pampered young lady
from a wealthy family,

00:28:46.790 --> 00:28:48.640
how would you understand these things?

00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:50.300
I'm not a pampered young lady.

00:28:50.790 --> 00:28:52.880
A pampered young lady wouldn't know
how to treat wounds.

00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:54.140
My father is a scholar.

00:28:57.400 --> 00:28:58.200
At least,

00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:01.260
you can eat a full meal, right?

00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:06.110
Where I was born,

00:29:07.070 --> 00:29:08.530
girls were sold off

00:29:08.590 --> 00:29:10.030
before they even grew up.

00:29:12.790 --> 00:29:14.610
When boys reach 6 or 7 years old,

00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:18.410
they have to follow their fathers
into the mines to dig for coal.

00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:22.350
My father died when the mine collapsed,

00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:23.840
and he was buried inside.

00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:26.210
My two younger brothers

00:29:26.790 --> 00:29:28.630
died when water flooded the mine

00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:29.680
and drowned them.

00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:32.260
The youngest was only 4 years old.

00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:36.210
My mother had to borrow money
from loan sharks

00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:37.510
just to barely afford

00:29:37.510 --> 00:29:39.440
two dog-knocker coffins

00:29:40.310 --> 00:29:41.850
to bury them.

00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:45.130
What does "dog-knocker" mean?

00:29:48.270 --> 00:29:50.070
If the coffin boards were thick,

00:29:50.270 --> 00:29:51.330
that would be fine.

00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:55.450
But the poor people's coffin
are all made too thin

00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:57.010
and buried in shallow pits.

00:29:57.350 --> 00:29:59.310
Heavy rain washes them out easily.

00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:02.400
Wild dogs would then follow the scent

00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:05.100
and knock open the coffin lids
with their heads.

00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:07.430
They'd drag out the bodies,

00:30:07.790 --> 00:30:09.160
tear them apart wildly,

00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:12.550
and leave them in pieces.

00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:16.130
My two older brothers and I

00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:17.750
worked desperately

00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:19.120
to no end,

00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:21.970
but still couldn't pay
the loan sharks back.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:23.300
What's a loan shark?

00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:29.730
The mine owner knew we needed money.

00:30:30.270 --> 00:30:32.230
So, he convinced my two brothers

00:30:32.310 --> 00:30:34.570
to blow up the mountain with explosives.

00:30:35.070 --> 00:30:36.670
They couldn't escape in time

00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:38.780
and were killed in the explosion.

00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:41.270
My mother lost all hope.

00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:44.830
She made me one last full meal.

00:30:46.270 --> 00:30:47.670
Then, while I was asleep,

00:30:48.110 --> 00:30:49.970
she drowned herself in the river.

00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:54.570
After that, I joined the Resistance Army.

00:30:54.830 --> 00:30:56.200
My comrades told me

00:30:57.480 --> 00:30:59.750
that all the suffering of poor people
in this world

00:30:59.750 --> 00:31:00.400
is because of

00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:02.030
those bastards.

00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:04.760
So I swore

00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:07.700
to kill all the evil people in this world.

00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:09.270
But you killed

00:31:09.310 --> 00:31:10.640
those innocent people.

00:31:11.110 --> 00:31:12.710
They had done nothing to you.

00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:15.260
No one in this world is innocent.

00:31:16.270 --> 00:31:16.920
Fine.

00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:18.090
I won't mention it again.

00:31:18.090 --> 00:31:18.950
Don't be angry.

00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:21.370
It would be bad if your wound reopened.

00:31:25.830 --> 00:31:27.630
This has been upsetting for you.

00:31:29.570 --> 00:31:30.400
When you go back,

00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:31.830
I'll reward you generously.

00:31:31.830 --> 00:31:33.560
What's there to be upset about?

00:31:33.990 --> 00:31:36.440
You'll eventually return
to the battlefield

00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:38.070
and come back like this again.

00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:39.420
I'm a soldier.

00:31:39.830 --> 00:31:41.240
Fighting is my destiny.

00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:44.760
Besides,

00:31:44.830 --> 00:31:46.230
dying wouldn't be so bad.

00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:49.080
If I die, I can see

00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:50.890
my parents and brothers again.

00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:55.480
I miss them so much.

00:32:24.110 --> 00:32:24.540
Yimei.

00:32:27.220 --> 00:32:27.990
Gu.

00:32:28.470 --> 00:32:30.670
Your father asked me to give this to you.

00:32:33.540 --> 00:32:34.800
What did my father say?

00:32:34.830 --> 00:32:37.160
He wants you to return
as soon as possible.

00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:41.340
Are you doing alright?

00:32:45.270 --> 00:32:45.750
Here.

00:32:51.070 --> 00:32:52.270
You have knives and scissors here.

00:32:52.270 --> 00:32:52.920
If I really wanted to do something,

00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:54.920
I wouldn't need to sneak a weapon in.

00:32:55.350 --> 00:32:56.160
And you call yourself a deputy commander.

00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:57.070
You're such a coward.

00:32:57.070 --> 00:32:58.350
Who are you calling a coward?

00:32:58.350 --> 00:32:59.240
Say that again. I dare you.

00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:00.100
That's enough.

00:33:01.790 --> 00:33:02.960
You can't win an argument

00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:04.020
against a scholar.

00:33:04.590 --> 00:33:06.320
Let him come forward and speak.

00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:07.760
You heard him.

00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:11.640
General, about the hemp ropes
and tung oil...

00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:12.400
I know.

00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:19.350
I heard that you bought

00:33:19.550 --> 00:33:20.880
4,000 barrels of oil

00:33:21.350 --> 00:33:22.880
and six carts of hemp rope in Huizhou.

00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:23.510
Yes.

00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:25.350
I bought all the tung oil

00:33:25.350 --> 00:33:26.240
in Huizhou.

00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:29.310
A man of your word.

00:33:30.030 --> 00:33:31.090
You've earned back

00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:32.590
your life by yourself.

00:33:34.110 --> 00:33:35.710
I see you're feeling better.

00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:38.010
I'd like to take Yimei and leave first.

00:33:41.210 --> 00:33:42.550
When it's time to send her back,

00:33:42.550 --> 00:33:43.720
I will do so myself.

00:33:43.750 --> 00:33:44.810
No need to say more.

00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:46.350
You've kept your word.

00:33:46.350 --> 00:33:47.310
I'll keep mine.

00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:50.930
It's not that I don't trust you.

00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:53.610
I just think once the war breaks out,

00:33:54.270 --> 00:33:56.870
you might not
even be able to protect yourself.

00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:01.200
Take him away.

00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:01.930
Yes, sir.

00:34:02.310 --> 00:34:02.830
Out!

00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:05.270
-Get out!
-General!

00:34:05.270 --> 00:34:06.200
Get out!

00:34:07.830 --> 00:34:08.190
Go!

00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:10.639
Give me the medicine.

00:34:17.420 --> 00:34:18.190
General.

00:34:21.239 --> 00:34:22.389
Speak freely.

00:34:22.409 --> 00:34:23.320
She's such a blockhead,

00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:25.120
she won't understand anything.

00:34:26.670 --> 00:34:27.280
General.

00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:29.159
Actually, these days,

00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:30.710
the others in the camp

00:34:30.730 --> 00:34:31.400
keep asking

00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:32.810
when we're going to move.

00:34:32.810 --> 00:34:34.270
What's there to ask about?

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:36.020
Our orders from above

00:34:36.020 --> 00:34:37.360
are to wait here for ships

00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:38.510
to transport the troops.

00:34:38.510 --> 00:34:39.239
I haven't even seen

00:34:39.239 --> 00:34:40.570
the shadow of a ship yet.

00:34:40.770 --> 00:34:41.840
But everyone's saying

00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:42.670
that our navy

00:34:42.690 --> 00:34:44.690
was defeated by the imperial court.

00:34:45.710 --> 00:34:46.480
Nonsense!

00:34:47.090 --> 00:34:47.860
General.

00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:51.670
Where did you hear that?

00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:52.800
From our men who escaped

00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:53.920
and came back.

00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:56.010
They say our navy has defected.

00:34:56.030 --> 00:34:57.850
It's not just a rumor. It's true.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:34:58.400
See?

00:34:58.480 --> 00:34:59.940
How fast the news travels!

00:35:00.350 --> 00:35:01.140
General.

00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:03.070
Are we stranded here alone?

00:35:03.630 --> 00:35:04.550
The men are saying

00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:06.280
we should have gone
to surround Hefei long ago.

00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:07.510
If we stay in this godforsaken place,

00:35:07.510 --> 00:35:09.370
we'll be swallowed whole one day.

00:35:11.070 --> 00:35:12.000
Bring me the map.

00:35:12.030 --> 00:35:12.630
Yes, sir.

00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:19.450
General.

00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:22.360
Here. Careful.

00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:27.060
[Angelica sinensis, Dipsacus asper 1 tael,
Cynanchum paniculatum
3 taels, Deer antler 0.5 tael]

00:35:27.510 --> 00:35:28.850
Who wrote on my map?

00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:41.660
Qimen and Anqing have fallen.

00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:43.710
The upper Yangtze is now exposed.

00:35:43.710 --> 00:35:44.800
If we go south now,

00:35:45.590 --> 00:35:46.550
we'll walk right into

00:35:46.550 --> 00:35:48.760
the imperial court's troops waiting there.

00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:49.600
If you have

00:35:49.630 --> 00:35:50.880
even the slightest thought of retreat,

00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:52.000
we'll be completely wiped out.

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:53.200
What will you do then?

00:35:56.240 --> 00:35:57.670
Then, let's attack Hefei.

00:35:57.670 --> 00:35:58.440
Yes, General.

00:35:58.440 --> 00:35:59.570
General, let's attack Hefei.

00:35:59.570 --> 00:36:00.670
-Let's attack Hefei.
-Let's do it.

00:36:00.670 --> 00:36:01.440
Attack Hefei?

00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:03.100
We weren't ordered to do that.

00:36:04.230 --> 00:36:05.450
We were told to hold this position

00:36:05.450 --> 00:36:06.580
to relieve pressure

00:36:06.590 --> 00:36:07.790
for the siege forces.

00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:09.700
If we withdraw,

00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:12.000
the imperial court's forces will sweep in

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:12.930
and immediately

00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:14.550
surround the Resistance Army

00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:15.720
besieging Hefei.

00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:17.990
Who will take responsibility for that?

00:36:17.990 --> 00:36:18.900
I will.

00:36:18.990 --> 00:36:19.550
You?

00:36:19.630 --> 00:36:21.090
How many heads do you have?

00:36:21.230 --> 00:36:21.920
General,

00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:23.800
the navy won't be coming.

00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:25.540
If we just wait here,

00:36:25.630 --> 00:36:27.030
when their cavalry arrives,

00:36:27.030 --> 00:36:27.670
one charge

00:36:27.670 --> 00:36:28.710
and they'll drive us all

00:36:28.710 --> 00:36:30.770
into the Yangtze to feed the turtles.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:31.880
We might as well

00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:33.360
go to Hefei and join the attack.

00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:35.420
We'll take the city, and all get rich.

00:36:43.030 --> 00:36:44.560
What if we can't take Hefei?

00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:47.630
If we can't take it,

00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:49.570
we'll either

00:36:50.190 --> 00:36:51.240
die

00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:52.400
or

00:36:53.550 --> 00:36:54.280
surrender.

00:36:56.030 --> 00:36:57.050
I’ll kill you!

00:36:57.110 --> 00:36:58.450
General, calm down!

00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:00.110
-General! Calm down!
-General.

00:37:00.110 --> 00:37:00.640
General!

00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:02.000
I don't want to live anymore.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:02.960
Ever since my two brothers

00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:03.790
died,

00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:05.450
I haven’t wanted to live anymore.

00:37:05.450 --> 00:37:06.150
Come on!

00:37:06.670 --> 00:37:07.590
Cut me down!

00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:08.590
Do it!

00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:17.960
I'm still investigating
the naval situation!

00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:20.920
If the navy has truly been defeated,

00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:22.840
we'll move immediately!

00:37:26.070 --> 00:37:27.000
But before that,

00:37:28.190 --> 00:37:30.200
if any of you stir up dissent again,

00:37:31.670 --> 00:37:33.330
I will personally behead you.

00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:36.230
I know.

00:37:37.710 --> 00:37:38.670
The battle has dragged on

00:37:38.670 --> 00:37:40.470
and everyone feels frustrated.

00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:43.740
But if we can't live well as humans,

00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:47.090
what makes you think we’d live
good lives as dogs?

00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:49.020
If you only wanted a full meal,

00:37:49.630 --> 00:37:51.510
why bother joining the Resistance Army?

00:37:51.510 --> 00:37:53.110
Why risk your life in battle?

00:37:54.190 --> 00:37:55.650
Those words you just said,

00:37:57.960 --> 00:37:59.890
do they honor our fallen brothers?

00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:08.700
Everyone, dismissed.

00:38:18.070 --> 00:38:18.760
Leave.

00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:33.320
Did I scare you?

00:38:35.190 --> 00:38:36.520
This is what war is like.

00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:41.620
The medicine is burnt.

00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:48.550
Here.

00:38:56.920 --> 00:39:01.400
Tea picking in January marks the new year.

00:39:01.670 --> 00:39:06.070
Tea picking in February
welcomes the new spring.

00:39:06.550 --> 00:39:11.030
Tea picking in March,
when peach blossoms are red.

00:39:11.510 --> 00:39:15.760
Tea picking in April makes us busy.

00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:20.760
Tea picking in September,
when chrysanthemums are yellow.

00:39:21.190 --> 00:39:25.590
Tea picking in October,
when it's briefly warm.

00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:30.510
Tea picking in November,
when snowflakes fall.

00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:39.070
Tea picking in December,
when another year passes.

00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:37.920
Drink some water.

00:40:54.020 --> 00:40:55.880
Sir, please don't worry anymore.

00:40:56.430 --> 00:40:58.890
I'll go to the military camp again
tomorrow.

00:40:59.190 --> 00:41:01.760
Yimei is a good person,
heaven will protect her.

00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:03.220
She's always been so kind,

00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:03.880
she wouldn't even

00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:04.760
step on an ant.

00:41:05.650 --> 00:41:07.850
Heaven won't let someone like her down.

00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:09.320
You can't go there again.

00:41:11.070 --> 00:41:13.400
Tigers and wolves don't listen to reason.

00:41:14.070 --> 00:41:15.030
They didn't eat you today

00:41:15.030 --> 00:41:16.560
because you were lucky,

00:41:16.670 --> 00:41:19.070
not because they've changed their nature.

00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:23.170
I've already lost my daughter.

00:41:26.070 --> 00:41:27.600
If I were to lose you as well,

00:41:29.870 --> 00:41:31.820
I don’t think I could keep living.

00:41:32.030 --> 00:41:32.840
Sir,

00:41:33.070 --> 00:41:34.330
don't think like that.

00:41:34.930 --> 00:41:36.020
In this world,

00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:38.120
nothing is greater than reason.

00:41:38.690 --> 00:41:39.480
She has already saved

00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:40.680
that general's life.

00:41:41.110 --> 00:41:42.570
What more could they want?

00:41:43.420 --> 00:41:45.860
Reason is something between humans.

00:41:46.550 --> 00:41:48.950
What reason can you talk about
with beasts?

00:41:49.710 --> 00:41:50.880
Look at tigers and wolves,

00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:52.540
they don't eat their own kind.

00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:53.580
But humans?

00:41:54.110 --> 00:41:55.630
They specifically slaughter and enslave

00:41:55.630 --> 00:41:56.540
their own kind.

00:41:56.590 --> 00:41:58.150
They're worse than beasts.

00:41:58.760 --> 00:42:00.360
Who can you reason with then?

00:42:08.110 --> 00:42:09.960
I've been thinking these days.

00:42:12.070 --> 00:42:14.000
Now that Yimei has been taken away,

00:42:14.110 --> 00:42:15.840
only a few outcomes may happen.

00:42:16.830 --> 00:42:17.520
Outcome 1,

00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:20.890
she returns unharmed.

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:23.710
This is certainly the best outcome.

00:42:23.710 --> 00:42:25.840
May all the Bodhisattvas protect her.

00:42:28.030 --> 00:42:28.670
Outcome 3

00:42:30.710 --> 00:42:32.440
is the worst outcome.

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:38.400
Only her body comes back.

00:42:43.590 --> 00:42:45.760
Maybe, we might not even find her body.

00:42:54.840 --> 00:42:56.950
If so, I would soon follow her.

00:42:59.150 --> 00:43:01.030
But I fear outcome 2.
