00:01:49.928 --> 00:01:51.080

It's the third day since grouping.

00:02:04.636 --> 00:02:05.832
(Today's luck is on the way)

00:02:23.371 --> 00:02:25.531
Did our Haryald's top boy
get scolded by Ms. Bai again?

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.091
Did you finish the task

00:02:29.091 --> 00:02:29.971
Mr. Song gave you?

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.971
This is our case-compiling queen,
Ren Jiatong.

00:02:40.531 --> 00:02:41.851
Others work, she compiles files.

00:02:41.851 --> 00:02:44.200
Others eat and get off work,
she compiles files.

Guo Xiaoyu.

00:02:45.971 --> 00:02:46.490
Delete that.

00:02:52.251 --> 00:02:53.971
Princess Fei, look up please.

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:56.371
Say something about the team assignment.

Do you have nothing better to do?

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.330
Day three after the split.

00:03:09.971 --> 00:03:11.330
Everyone's getting weirder.

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.050
And I, an Excel slave,

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.930
want to say:

00:03:14.411 --> 00:03:15.610
May the world never have

00:03:15.851 --> 00:03:17.251
Microsoft Office.

WPS welcomes you, ma'am.

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:23.490
But...

00:03:23.811 --> 00:03:25.490
Only two days left

00:03:25.971 --> 00:03:27.050
till the Mid-Autumn break.

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.424

00:03:48.828 --> 00:03:49.768
(Please check the case files)

00:03:49.768 --> 00:03:51.528
(and complete the tasks
as required. Bai Xiao)

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:59.131
(Jiatong, happy birthday.)

00:04:00.131 --> 00:04:02.170
(Let's throw you
a birthday party tomorrow.)

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:03.291
(Get a big cake.)

00:04:04.872 --> 00:04:07.330
(Ren Jiatong)
(No. I haven't celebrated it in years.)

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:08.691
(I don't like birthdays.)

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:10.291
(How did you know my birthday?)

00:04:10.984 --> 00:04:11.571
(Guo Xiaoyu)

00:04:11.571 --> 00:04:13.531
(I'm Jun An's zodiac expert.)

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:16.171
(I remember everyone's zodiac signs
and birthdays.)

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:21.611
It's a little cold here.

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:24.131
I'll go sit over there.

00:05:30.811 --> 00:05:31.330
Look.

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:34.251
Don't they look

00:05:34.251 --> 00:05:36.450
like some martial-arts masters

00:05:36.731 --> 00:05:37.811
dueling with their minds?

00:05:38.371 --> 00:05:39.371
Like playing blind chess.

00:05:39.571 --> 00:05:40.571
No physical movements

00:05:40.571 --> 00:05:42.450
but they already fought
hundreds of rounds.

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:45.850
I don't get it, but I'm amazed.

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:50.408
Hey, guys.

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:53.931
Jiang Chen, Ren Jiatong.

00:05:54.171 --> 00:05:55.251
Ms. Bai's calling you.

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:14.850
Why am I more nervous than them?

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:18.691
Wanna bet who wins?

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:21.931
Guo Xiaoyu, where's your dignity?

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:25.970
Ren Jiatong.

00:06:30.811 --> 00:06:31.611
Then, Jiang Chen.

00:06:32.691 --> 00:06:33.450
And you, Xiaoyu?

00:06:34.931 --> 00:06:36.611
Don't ask me. I'm a Libra.

00:06:36.811 --> 00:06:38.330
I have decision-making issues.

00:06:56.850 --> 00:06:57.731
All prepared?

00:06:58.850 --> 00:06:59.850
Who's going first?

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:01.131
I'll go first.

00:07:01.371 --> 00:07:01.928
Ms. Bai.

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:02.731
I think

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:04.770
there are two potential defendants here.

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:05.770
(Defendant 01: Friends)
First, the friends.

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:07.571
They encouraged drinking

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:09.450
and didn't stop the drunk driving.

00:07:09.571 --> 00:07:10.450
Based on past cases

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:11.611
I've studied,

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:14.450
friends are ruled liable

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:15.691
in about 10% of judgments.

00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:18.611
(Defendant 02: Insurance Co.)
Second, sue the insurer

00:07:18.931 --> 00:07:20.770
and the employer
through labor arbitration.

00:07:21.131 --> 00:07:22.970
But since our client was drunk driving,

00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:25.371
winning will be challenging.

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:27.051
Work Injury Insurance Regulations

00:07:27.051 --> 00:07:30.011
and Mandatory Motor
Insurance Regulations

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:32.731
exclude drunk driving.

00:07:33.251 --> 00:07:35.530
(Defendant 03: Employer)
As for pursuing the employer,

00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:37.011
this is more of a pressure tactic.

00:07:37.371 --> 00:07:39.011
Push them emotionally

00:07:39.011 --> 00:07:39.571
to get

00:07:39.571 --> 00:07:41.410
more humanitarian compensation.

00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:42.611
In my complaint,

00:07:42.611 --> 00:07:44.410
beyond his points,

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:46.850
(Defendant 04 Road Management)
I'll also sue the road authority.

00:07:47.131 --> 00:07:48.650
Materials show

00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:50.131
the streetlights near the crash site

00:07:50.131 --> 00:07:51.770
were broken

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:53.811
with no timely repairs,

00:07:54.011 --> 00:07:55.571
causing poor visibility

00:07:55.571 --> 00:07:56.371
and the crash.

00:07:56.691 --> 00:07:57.731
Most importantly,

00:07:57.770 --> 00:07:58.650
the road management

00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:00.171
has compensation capabilities.

00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:01.650
So our client's family

00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:03.691
can get real compensation.

00:08:12.611 --> 00:08:13.491
Right now,

00:08:13.491 --> 00:08:15.571
I honestly can't pick between you two.

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:20.210
Neither of your complaints
meets my standards.

00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:22.811
If you both want a spot

00:08:22.890 --> 00:08:23.850
in my team,

00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:25.051
go rewrite.

00:08:25.931 --> 00:08:26.611
Today is Friday.

00:08:27.011 --> 00:08:28.770
Submit revised ones by Sunday noon.

00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:55.560
Mr. Zhou.

00:08:58.011 --> 00:08:58.568
Want to join?

00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:06.251
Order any?

00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:08.104
Drink?

00:09:09.611 --> 00:09:10.120
Well...

00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:11.016
Is this okay?

00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:13.384
Cheers.

00:09:21.331 --> 00:09:22.331
Mr. Zhou, I've had three.

00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:23.251
Three already.

00:09:23.251 --> 00:09:24.810
Shouldn't you catch up?

00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:27.611
Let's drop formalities.

00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:28.936
Fine.

00:09:29.611 --> 00:09:31.091
Yan Fei cornered me today.

00:09:31.451 --> 00:09:32.530
She asked me

00:09:32.971 --> 00:09:34.091
how to join Mr. Song's team.

00:09:34.690 --> 00:09:35.371
I'm puzzled.

00:09:35.371 --> 00:09:37.170
Her family could easily solve that.

00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:39.410
Why make things hard for me?

00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:40.872
Before I

00:09:41.650 --> 00:09:42.890
even assigned her work,

00:09:43.251 --> 00:09:44.731
already so many people

00:09:46.091 --> 00:09:47.810
were hinting that

00:09:48.251 --> 00:09:49.930
I must go easy on Yan Fei

00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:51.131
and don't tire her out.

00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:52.410
You know what?

00:09:53.290 --> 00:09:54.491
Miss Yan came

00:09:55.491 --> 00:09:57.011
to complain yesterday,

00:09:57.650 --> 00:09:58.971
listing facts and logic,

00:09:59.170 --> 00:10:01.091
because I didn't give her assignments.

00:10:04.011 --> 00:10:04.584
No kidding.

00:10:05.331 --> 00:10:05.864
Why

00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:07.690
would she complain?

00:10:08.091 --> 00:10:09.650
She said it wasn't her choice.

00:10:10.131 --> 00:10:11.530
It was her family's.

00:10:12.091 --> 00:10:14.050
She wants equal treatment.

00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:18.131
Frankly, I get her, Mr. Zhou.

00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:19.851
Parents nowadays

00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:21.930
are too controlling.

00:10:24.451 --> 00:10:25.211
She just

00:10:26.290 --> 00:10:27.650
doesn't know how good she has it.

00:10:28.251 --> 00:10:29.650
Others work their whole lives

00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:30.890
to get her starting point.

00:10:30.971 --> 00:10:31.560
Am I right?

00:10:32.011 --> 00:10:33.650
Why come to Jun An?

00:10:35.011 --> 00:10:36.211
Being a lawyer is hard.

00:10:37.451 --> 00:10:37.971
In our firm,

00:10:38.331 --> 00:10:39.091
everyone

00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:41.371
who looks shiny on the surface

00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:43.050
suffers a lot beneath.

00:10:43.690 --> 00:10:44.371
What's she after?

00:10:46.331 --> 00:10:47.570
And what are you after?

00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:49.611
Your former US firm

00:10:50.371 --> 00:10:52.290
are renowned

00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:53.290
for good pay.

00:10:53.851 --> 00:10:55.211
Even Jun An's a Red Circle Firm,

00:10:55.851 --> 00:10:57.050
it's nothing compared to it.

00:10:57.890 --> 00:10:58.410
Why?

00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:00.770
I don't know.

00:11:01.810 --> 00:11:03.570
Maybe we all seek

00:11:04.690 --> 00:11:06.371
a life we choose ourselves.

00:11:07.251 --> 00:11:07.810
Dramatic.

00:11:10.091 --> 00:11:11.011
Mr. Zhou. Actually,

00:11:11.731 --> 00:11:12.930
ever since I came back,

00:11:13.491 --> 00:11:15.410
I've had this fire inside me

00:11:17.050 --> 00:11:18.211
to prove something.

00:11:18.211 --> 00:11:19.611
I want to prove I can do it.

00:11:20.331 --> 00:11:21.491
I'm capable.

00:11:21.810 --> 00:11:25.331
I can live the life I want.

00:11:25.650 --> 00:11:27.611
But after just one month at Jun An,

00:11:28.770 --> 00:11:29.611
I found it's so hard.

00:11:30.650 --> 00:11:31.208
Sorry.

00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:33.971
I went through so much

00:11:33.971 --> 00:11:35.690
to earn this degree from Haryald.

00:11:35.971 --> 00:11:37.491
But when I start to work, I realize

00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:39.810
it's superficial. It means nothing.

00:11:40.731 --> 00:11:41.320
Therefore,

00:11:41.731 --> 00:11:42.851
I don't know what I'm after.

00:11:44.770 --> 00:11:45.371
Jiang Chen.

00:11:46.731 --> 00:11:47.930
You shouldn't say that.

00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:50.170
Got scolded by Ms. Bai today?

00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:51.770
Don't overthink.

00:11:52.050 --> 00:11:52.851
We're lawyers

00:11:53.851 --> 00:11:55.611
can't give up over small setbacks.

00:11:57.690 --> 00:11:58.376
Mr. Zhou.

00:11:58.810 --> 00:11:59.851
I won't give up.

00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:01.810
In my life, I only win.

00:12:02.491 --> 00:12:03.048
Cheers.

00:12:28.050 --> 00:12:28.810
Still working?

00:12:29.131 --> 00:12:29.800
Mr. Song.

00:12:33.890 --> 00:12:34.890
I'll tell you again.

00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:36.211
You're not a machine.

00:12:36.331 --> 00:12:37.530
Work never ends.

00:12:38.091 --> 00:12:39.331
Jun An promotes

00:12:39.331 --> 00:12:40.530
work-life balance.

00:12:41.371 --> 00:12:43.131
I barely survived the last elimination.

00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:44.491
I want to do better.

00:12:45.170 --> 00:12:45.731
Moreover,

00:12:45.971 --> 00:12:47.851
Ms. Bai isn't satisfied with my work.

00:12:49.331 --> 00:12:50.371
Getting her satisfied is

00:12:50.611 --> 00:12:51.410
almost impossible.

00:12:52.810 --> 00:12:53.491
But

00:12:53.650 --> 00:12:54.810
getting a chance from her

00:12:55.211 --> 00:12:56.131
means you're potential.

00:12:56.851 --> 00:12:58.650
If you truly want to be a lawyer,

00:12:59.011 --> 00:12:59.971
some hardship now

00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:01.331
isn't bad.

00:13:02.770 --> 00:13:04.410
People in our field only survive

00:13:04.611 --> 00:13:05.611
if they truly love it.

00:13:08.091 --> 00:13:09.331
Ms. Bai has

00:13:09.611 --> 00:13:10.570
come through

00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:12.170
countless struggles.

00:13:13.251 --> 00:13:14.091
Tell you a secret.

00:13:15.570 --> 00:13:17.290
The extra test last time

00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:18.211
was her idea.

00:13:20.371 --> 00:13:21.050
Are you saying

00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:23.091
Ms. Bai helped me stay?

00:13:25.131 --> 00:13:25.770
And Jiang Chen.

00:13:26.611 --> 00:13:27.570
He used

00:13:27.971 --> 00:13:29.770
his own bonus to plead for you.

00:13:31.731 --> 00:13:32.570
With these supports,

00:13:32.971 --> 00:13:33.890
you can be reassured.

00:13:37.091 --> 00:13:38.491
Finish your work and go home.

00:13:39.131 --> 00:13:39.930
Tomorrow's weekend.

00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:41.410
Thanks, Mr. Song.

00:13:59.050 --> 00:13:59.930
Be careful, Mr. Zhou.

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:03.170
Come on.

00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:04.296
Watch your head.

00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:06.091
To the subway entrance.

00:14:06.152 --> 00:14:06.664
The nearest.

00:14:06.664 --> 00:14:07.251
Got it.

00:14:07.251 --> 00:14:07.851
- Mr. Zhou.
- Got it.

00:14:07.851 --> 00:14:09.131
You sure about the subway?

00:14:09.131 --> 00:14:09.971
Not home?

00:14:10.491 --> 00:14:11.050
Don't worry.

00:14:11.091 --> 00:14:12.011
Subway entrance's fine.

00:14:12.371 --> 00:14:13.011
- Bye.
- Bye.

00:14:15.131 --> 00:14:15.656
Chen.

00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:17.050
Easy, easy.

00:14:17.731 --> 00:14:19.410
We had a great talk today.

00:14:20.371 --> 00:14:21.290
If you need anything,

00:14:21.971 --> 00:14:22.890
just call me.

00:14:23.770 --> 00:14:24.328
Okay.

00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:25.690
Mr. Zhou, go home.

00:14:26.890 --> 00:14:27.530
Bye.

00:14:28.131 --> 00:14:29.170
Sir, slowly please.

00:14:29.810 --> 00:14:30.611
Subway entrance.

00:14:36.371 --> 00:14:37.170
Just one drink,

00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:38.570
and you're this close already?

00:14:39.371 --> 00:14:40.131
If Li Ke knows,

00:14:40.131 --> 00:14:41.211
he'll be heartbroken.

00:14:41.611 --> 00:14:43.371
His senior never treated him this well.

00:14:44.170 --> 00:14:44.731
Just off work?

00:14:46.611 --> 00:14:47.211
I heard

00:14:47.211 --> 00:14:49.290
you pleaded with Mr. Song for me,

00:14:49.530 --> 00:14:51.251
even used your own exemption.

00:14:51.890 --> 00:14:52.491
Why?

00:14:53.131 --> 00:14:54.491
No idea what you're talking about.

00:14:55.131 --> 00:14:56.331
Don't listen to Li Ke.

00:14:56.690 --> 00:14:57.451
Mr. Song told me.

00:15:02.170 --> 00:15:02.890
I...

00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:04.570
I did talk to Mr. Song.

00:15:05.890 --> 00:15:07.251
Because I think at Jun An,

00:15:07.251 --> 00:15:09.611
you're the only real competitor I have.

00:15:09.890 --> 00:15:11.331
I want to compete with you.

00:15:12.371 --> 00:15:14.131
I couldn't let you leave like that.

00:15:16.290 --> 00:15:17.611
Why didn't you tell me?

00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:19.650
You're fiercely independent.

00:15:20.570 --> 00:15:21.570
If I told you,

00:15:22.170 --> 00:15:23.371
you wouldn't have accepted it.

00:15:26.690 --> 00:15:27.570
Anyway,

00:15:28.011 --> 00:15:28.851
thank you.

00:15:29.971 --> 00:15:30.930
But this time,

00:15:32.290 --> 00:15:33.770
it's a death match.

00:15:36.451 --> 00:15:37.000
Why?

00:15:38.251 --> 00:15:39.570
Why must it be a death match?

00:15:41.290 --> 00:15:42.650
Remember the medical dispute case?

00:15:43.331 --> 00:15:44.650
Separately, both our drafts

00:15:45.050 --> 00:15:45.650
were bad.

00:15:46.570 --> 00:15:47.851
But when we collaborated,

00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:49.131
Ms. Bai was impressed.

00:15:49.371 --> 00:15:49.890
Remember?

00:15:50.451 --> 00:15:52.131
Let's try a different approach.

00:15:52.770 --> 00:15:53.851
Let's team up again

00:15:54.290 --> 00:15:55.251
and both join her team.

00:15:56.930 --> 00:15:58.011
Both join her team?

00:15:58.770 --> 00:15:59.731
Since we're currently

00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:01.290
both inexperienced

00:16:01.530 --> 00:16:03.131
and can't produce quality work alone,

00:16:03.731 --> 00:16:04.491
let's work together

00:16:04.770 --> 00:16:05.890
and do the best.

00:16:06.211 --> 00:16:07.170
Ms. Bai always says

00:16:07.731 --> 00:16:08.851
she only looks at results.

00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:11.371
We don't need to fight to the death.

00:16:12.011 --> 00:16:13.451
Let's join her team together.

00:16:15.011 --> 00:16:16.971
But Ms. Bai only take one person
each year.

00:16:17.690 --> 00:16:19.491
Jun An has always emphasized

00:16:19.491 --> 00:16:20.491
it's inclusive,

00:16:20.770 --> 00:16:21.448
open,

00:16:22.211 --> 00:16:23.331
and respects growth.

00:16:24.011 --> 00:16:25.770
And honestly, I think

00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:26.491
all the rules

00:16:26.611 --> 00:16:27.731
are meant to be broken.

00:16:28.331 --> 00:16:29.810
Look at Ms. Bai and Mr. Song.

00:16:30.290 --> 00:16:31.451
They're top lawyers,

00:16:31.451 --> 00:16:33.530
yet neither follows conventions blindly.

00:16:34.371 --> 00:16:35.251
Take Ms. Bai.

00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:36.810
She worked in Jun An

00:16:36.810 --> 00:16:37.770
since graduation,

00:16:38.091 --> 00:16:38.971
and suddenly switched

00:16:39.451 --> 00:16:40.650
to a small firm.

00:16:40.770 --> 00:16:42.371
She returned till her daughter's one.

00:16:42.810 --> 00:16:43.690
Still a partner.

00:16:45.091 --> 00:16:46.170
She did switch firms?

00:16:46.491 --> 00:16:47.048
Yes.

00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:49.650
From Jun An to a small firm,
then came back.

00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:50.810
Don't you find it cool?

00:16:56.570 --> 00:16:57.890
The cooperation idea...

00:16:58.690 --> 00:16:59.371
Still valid?

00:17:03.091 --> 00:17:03.592
Deal.

00:17:05.211 --> 00:17:06.891
Your newly added defendant

00:17:07.211 --> 00:17:09.090
(Ren Jiatong, Jiang Chen)
is something about a wall by the road.

00:17:09.090 --> 00:17:09.891
Explain in detail.

00:17:11.090 --> 00:17:13.290
Mom, can I have some cake?

00:17:13.491 --> 00:17:15.130
Of course.

00:17:15.130 --> 00:17:16.891
Come, I'll feed you.

00:17:17.731 --> 00:17:18.330
But

00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:19.770
Mom is having

00:17:19.770 --> 00:17:21.171
an important meeting.

00:17:21.330 --> 00:17:22.530
(Ren Jiatong, Jiang Chen)
While I'm talking,

00:17:22.850 --> 00:17:24.370
try not to interrupt, okay?

00:17:25.411 --> 00:17:26.024
Right.

00:17:27.370 --> 00:17:28.171
Let me feed you.

00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:30.216
Come.

00:17:35.570 --> 00:17:36.370
Send me the files

00:17:36.370 --> 00:17:37.451
to my email.

00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:38.530
Got it.

00:17:39.251 --> 00:17:40.691
The final version is with her.

00:17:41.011 --> 00:17:42.090
Forward it to Ms. Bai.

00:17:42.568 --> 00:17:43.656
(Ren Jiatong, Jiang Chen)
Good girl.

00:17:52.443 --> 00:17:55.048
(Jiang Chen:
What's wrong? Send the files.)

00:17:58.850 --> 00:17:59.451
Sorry.

00:17:59.451 --> 00:18:00.651
My computer froze.

00:18:00.850 --> 00:18:02.130
I'll send the files right away.

00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:02.971
One moment.

00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:07.731
Done.

00:18:13.404 --> 00:18:14.536
(Ren Jiatong: I'm fine.)

00:18:14.536 --> 00:18:17.512
(The cake looked delicious.
I got distracted.)

00:18:24.130 --> 00:18:24.770
Ms. Bai.

00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:27.171
While reviewing the scene photos,

00:18:27.171 --> 00:18:29.290
we noticed an empty space
behind the wall.

00:18:29.691 --> 00:18:30.931
We guessed

00:18:31.011 --> 00:18:33.211
it's an area under planned construction.

00:18:33.530 --> 00:18:35.251
So we searched

00:18:35.251 --> 00:18:37.211
the government bidding website

00:18:37.211 --> 00:18:38.370
and found that

00:18:38.651 --> 00:18:40.251
the land was flattened two years ago

00:18:40.251 --> 00:18:42.731
by a demolition company.

00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:45.251
The bidding documents clearly required

00:18:45.251 --> 00:18:47.691
removal of all structures
within two years.

00:18:47.971 --> 00:18:50.330
If that wall had been removed on time,

00:18:50.651 --> 00:18:52.651
the employee falling on the land

00:18:52.651 --> 00:18:53.891
might not have died.

00:18:54.090 --> 00:18:57.370
(Defendant 04 Road Management)
So the demolition company responsible

00:18:57.370 --> 00:18:59.144
(Defendant 05 Demolition Company)
should share liability.

00:18:59.144 --> 00:18:59.848
(Perfect!)

00:19:00.211 --> 00:19:02.411
Whose idea was this?

00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:03.810
- Ours.
- Our idea.

00:19:04.691 --> 00:19:05.570
Yours?

00:19:05.931 --> 00:19:07.491
I believe cooperation

00:19:07.491 --> 00:19:08.770
is more in line

00:19:08.770 --> 00:19:11.411
with the goals of Talent Hunt Program.

00:19:11.691 --> 00:19:12.891
So I hope

00:19:12.891 --> 00:19:14.491
you can make an exception for us.

00:19:14.931 --> 00:19:15.570
What exception?

00:19:17.570 --> 00:19:18.530
Mr. Zhou said

00:19:18.691 --> 00:19:20.530
you only take one new member a year.

00:19:21.251 --> 00:19:21.931
But we hope

00:19:22.810 --> 00:19:24.691
you can take both of us this year.

00:19:26.931 --> 00:19:27.891
I've heard

00:19:27.891 --> 00:19:29.491
that rumor in the firm.

00:19:30.050 --> 00:19:31.530
But I never said

00:19:31.530 --> 00:19:32.931
I only take one each year.

00:19:33.370 --> 00:19:36.011
I said I'd choose whoever performs best.

00:19:36.411 --> 00:19:37.651
- So both of us...
- So we...

00:19:37.931 --> 00:19:38.504
Well,

00:19:38.651 --> 00:19:40.251
that's all for today.

00:19:41.011 --> 00:19:41.810
Wait for results.

We're unbeatable together.)

(Bai Xiao's team: Jiang Chen, Ren Jiatong)
(at Jun An.)

00:21:19.891 --> 00:21:22.491
Mr. Zhou, I just received
the assignment email.

00:21:22.891 --> 00:21:24.330
I applied for Mr. Song's team.

00:21:24.651 --> 00:21:26.570
Why was I assigned to Mr. Zhuang's team?

00:21:27.050 --> 00:21:28.530
Did Mr. Song reject me?

00:21:30.770 --> 00:21:32.251
It's not Mr. Song's decision.

00:21:33.770 --> 00:21:34.971
Then what's really going on?

00:21:45.211 --> 00:21:45.768
Okay.

00:21:46.491 --> 00:21:47.130
I understand.

00:22:00.530 --> 00:22:02.251
Yan Da! Get over here!

00:22:02.971 --> 00:22:04.130
Are you insane?

00:22:04.491 --> 00:22:05.731
Enough!

00:22:06.610 --> 00:22:07.171
I'm sorry.

00:22:07.530 --> 00:22:08.370
I'll call you back.

00:22:09.530 --> 00:22:10.370
Yan Da!

00:22:15.691 --> 00:22:17.370
Yan Fei. What's wrong with you?

00:22:17.931 --> 00:22:19.090
Forgot your meds again?

00:22:20.370 --> 00:22:22.011
Why do you keep meddling?

00:22:22.290 --> 00:22:23.810
Must you control everything I do?

00:22:24.491 --> 00:22:26.491
When I joined Jun An,
I couldn't even get tasks.

00:22:26.491 --> 00:22:28.491
Now you're changing my mentor?

00:22:28.891 --> 00:22:30.411
Back in the UK when I dated someone,

00:22:30.411 --> 00:22:31.651
you forced me to break up.

00:22:31.810 --> 00:22:33.171
Now you're pushing me

00:22:33.171 --> 00:22:34.211
into blind dates.

00:22:34.451 --> 00:22:35.810
What do you want?

00:22:36.090 --> 00:22:38.050
Mr. Yan! Do you even see me as a person?

00:22:38.251 --> 00:22:40.171
Or just some pet you keep around?

00:22:40.171 --> 00:22:41.610
Don't you know

00:22:41.610 --> 00:22:42.691
why I made you break up?

00:22:43.530 --> 00:22:44.931
That guy was trash!

00:22:45.491 --> 00:22:46.570
He only wanted your money.

00:22:46.850 --> 00:22:47.971
If you hadn't left him,

00:22:48.090 --> 00:22:49.411
who knows what would've happened?

00:22:50.011 --> 00:22:51.211
You're overreacting.

00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:52.570
It's just a group assignment.

00:22:53.011 --> 00:22:54.090
You want to be a lawyer?

00:22:54.651 --> 00:22:56.130
What's so great about that?

00:22:57.130 --> 00:22:59.090
Well, all you did is for my own good.

00:22:59.090 --> 00:23:00.770
In your eyes I'm just useless.

00:23:01.130 --> 00:23:03.491
Have you ever considered what I want?

00:23:04.691 --> 00:23:06.130
Since you like Eddie so much,

00:23:06.251 --> 00:23:07.810
why don't you marry him yourself?

00:23:11.370 --> 00:23:11.976
Yan Fei!

00:23:24.011 --> 00:23:24.570
Jiatong.

00:23:24.770 --> 00:23:26.130
Someone sent you a cake.

00:23:26.770 --> 00:23:27.971
When are you coming back?

00:23:28.171 --> 00:23:29.330
It's been here awhile.

00:23:29.731 --> 00:23:31.330
I'm afraid it won't stay fresh.

00:23:33.610 --> 00:23:35.810
It's from a famous bakery.

00:23:36.050 --> 00:23:37.090
I'll send you a picture.

00:23:42.090 --> 00:23:42.810
Jiatong.

00:23:42.810 --> 00:23:43.770
Didn't you say

00:23:43.770 --> 00:23:45.330
you don't like birthday cakes?

00:23:46.530 --> 00:23:47.651
Let me try it for you.

00:24:00.011 --> 00:24:01.251
This cake is evil!

00:24:01.691 --> 00:24:02.691
It keeps tempting me.

00:24:04.330 --> 00:24:05.251
Just one bite.

00:24:05.651 --> 00:24:06.251
Just a nibble.

00:24:39.547 --> 00:24:41.256
(Jiatong, happy birthday)

00:25:13.171 --> 00:25:14.130
(How's the cake?)

00:25:18.931 --> 00:25:20.251
(You sent it?)

00:25:22.824 --> 00:25:23.850
(Yesterday you said)

00:25:23.850 --> 00:25:25.891
(you like Ms. Bai's daughter's cake.)

00:25:26.290 --> 00:25:29.090
(I thought if we both made it)

00:25:29.896 --> 00:25:31.016
(into Ms. Bai's team,)

00:25:31.944 --> 00:25:33.256
(I'd get you a cake.)

00:25:33.736 --> 00:25:34.632
(You like it?)

00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:43.336
(I love it.)

00:25:43.336 --> 00:25:44.936
(Just like her daughter,)

00:25:44.936 --> 00:25:46.236
(I really love cake.)

00:25:56.651 --> 00:25:58.952
(The first judgement
for the medical case is out.)

00:25:58.952 --> 00:26:00.008
The hospital's satisfied.

00:26:00.411 --> 00:26:01.651
At 3 PM, there's a meeting

00:26:01.651 --> 00:26:03.290
with their representatives.

00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:05.891
And your lunch meeting with Mr. Liu

00:26:05.891 --> 00:26:06.971
is at 11 AM.

00:26:07.251 --> 00:26:08.451
The materials are ready.

00:26:08.731 --> 00:26:09.256
Okay.

00:26:10.780 --> 00:26:12.392
(Dear Ms. Bai, hope I can keep learning
from you after internship. Liu Zheng)

00:26:15.370 --> 00:26:16.770
I remember this intern.

00:26:17.251 --> 00:26:18.491
Thank him for me.

00:26:19.171 --> 00:26:19.691
By the way,

00:26:19.971 --> 00:26:21.691
the tuna sandwiches and lattes here

00:26:21.691 --> 00:26:22.850
aren't cheap.

00:26:23.491 --> 00:26:24.891
I'll transfer you the money.

00:26:25.211 --> 00:26:26.011
Pass along to him.

00:26:26.971 --> 00:26:27.810
Understood, Ms. Bai.

00:26:27.971 --> 00:26:29.171
I'll convey your message.

00:26:29.810 --> 00:26:31.011
Also, please inform him

00:26:31.011 --> 00:26:33.130
that his retention
depends on his performance.

00:26:33.850 --> 00:26:34.472
Got it.

00:26:35.330 --> 00:26:36.850
Haven't eaten breakfast, right? Here.

00:26:37.610 --> 00:26:38.152
Thanks.

00:26:42.290 --> 00:26:43.491
You really are like Ms. Bai.

00:26:46.090 --> 00:26:47.570
She refuses free breakfast offers

00:26:48.011 --> 00:26:49.211
and returns the money.

00:26:49.731 --> 00:26:50.280
Am I right?

00:26:50.971 --> 00:26:51.610
Don't push it.

00:26:51.891 --> 00:26:53.411
Like you know me so well.

00:26:54.130 --> 00:26:54.770
I do.

00:26:55.530 --> 00:26:57.171
I know why you sneak glances at her.

00:27:13.491 --> 00:27:14.570
I can't figure it out.

00:27:15.330 --> 00:27:17.171
We've been reviewing this case
for three days.

00:27:18.090 --> 00:27:19.491
What exactly are we looking for?

00:27:20.370 --> 00:27:22.251
This work is tedious and boring.

00:27:23.370 --> 00:27:24.290
Must we do this?

00:27:25.211 --> 00:27:27.050
You've watched too many legal dramas.

00:27:27.411 --> 00:27:27.976
Did you think

00:27:28.491 --> 00:27:30.211
we'd be

00:27:30.211 --> 00:27:31.610
handling major cases every day,

00:27:31.770 --> 00:27:33.050
meeting clients,

00:27:33.211 --> 00:27:34.411
and living

00:27:34.411 --> 00:27:35.891
the thrilling lawyer life?

00:27:37.290 --> 00:27:38.570
We're not regular interns.

00:27:38.971 --> 00:27:39.491
Can't we?

00:27:40.130 --> 00:27:41.731
Didn't they teach you in school?

00:27:42.090 --> 00:27:43.130
Legal research,

00:27:43.130 --> 00:27:44.570
evidence discovery and organization,

00:27:44.691 --> 00:27:45.530
and legal writing

00:27:45.850 --> 00:27:47.691
are fundamental skills for litigators.

00:27:48.370 --> 00:27:50.370
Didn't you learn that?

00:27:52.891 --> 00:27:53.731
But are we

00:27:53.731 --> 00:27:55.731
just stuck reviewing trial evidence?

00:27:56.330 --> 00:27:57.130
Honestly,

00:27:57.451 --> 00:27:58.610
AI could do this job.

I was worried

00:28:59.610 --> 00:29:01.891
that I couldn't join Mr. Zhuang's team.

00:29:02.130 --> 00:29:04.251
But he took three interns at once.

00:29:05.211 --> 00:29:06.211
Why were you worried?

00:29:06.651 --> 00:29:07.971
You're smart and highly educated.

00:29:08.011 --> 00:29:10.090

00:29:14.570 --> 00:29:15.931
aka your Min,

00:29:15.931 --> 00:29:17.290
Lucy and Duoduo all like you.

00:29:17.610 --> 00:29:19.370
You're now our firm's heartthrob.

00:29:19.610 --> 00:29:20.971
We're the ones who should worry.

00:29:21.171 --> 00:29:21.736
Please.

00:29:21.971 --> 00:29:24.211
You're an Arenburg LLM grad.

00:29:24.211 --> 00:29:25.451
Why envy me?

00:29:25.530 --> 00:29:26.370
You're too modest.

00:29:26.530 --> 00:29:28.211
Let me know if you need anything.

00:29:28.530 --> 00:29:29.130
I'll help.

00:29:29.610 --> 00:29:31.090
Then I'll count on you.

00:29:32.050 --> 00:29:33.211
After all, you

00:29:33.211 --> 00:29:34.451
are the strongest of us three.

00:29:34.810 --> 00:29:36.570
Fei has good education
and family background.

00:29:36.570 --> 00:29:37.810
Mr. Zhuang must favor her most.

00:29:38.570 --> 00:29:40.530
I'm just average in every aspect.

00:29:41.850 --> 00:29:43.691
That's not entirely true.

00:29:44.491 --> 00:29:45.651
Everyone's different.

00:29:45.891 --> 00:29:46.570
Take Yan F...

00:29:48.610 --> 00:29:49.224
Here you come.

00:29:49.451 --> 00:29:49.992
Hi.

00:29:56.330 --> 00:29:57.090
Hi, Mr. Zhou.

00:29:57.290 --> 00:29:58.491
Well, seems you're not happy

00:29:58.491 --> 00:29:59.171
to see me.

00:29:59.290 --> 00:29:59.850
No, no.

00:30:00.130 --> 00:30:00.971
You're our senior.

00:30:00.971 --> 00:30:02.251
We're thrilled!

00:30:02.251 --> 00:30:02.971
Cut the act.

00:30:03.411 --> 00:30:04.136
Sit tight.

00:30:04.411 --> 00:30:05.171
Enough chatter.

00:30:05.570 --> 00:30:06.411
Got the email, right?

00:30:06.570 --> 00:30:07.272
Yes.

00:30:07.570 --> 00:30:08.290
Your first task

00:30:08.651 --> 00:30:09.211
after teaming

00:30:09.211 --> 00:30:10.891
should've been given by your mentor.

00:30:11.130 --> 00:30:12.451
But Mr. Zhuang is attending

00:30:12.451 --> 00:30:13.491
a bar association meeting.

00:30:13.491 --> 00:30:15.570
So I'm giving the assignment today.

00:30:17.290 --> 00:30:18.090
There is

00:30:18.090 --> 00:30:19.570
(Overview: An unfair competition case)
an unfair-competition case

00:30:19.570 --> 00:30:20.731
(led by Zhuang Xin)
involving trade-secret infringement.

00:30:20.850 --> 00:30:22.850
You need to research one question.

00:30:22.971 --> 00:30:24.330
Whether the client list

00:30:24.411 --> 00:30:25.891
the plaintiff relies on

00:30:26.130 --> 00:30:27.931
counts as a trade secret.

00:30:28.330 --> 00:30:29.770
The case is being tried in Nanjing.

00:30:30.090 --> 00:30:31.731
I've emailed you the details.

00:30:32.251 --> 00:30:32.971
Divide the work

00:30:33.211 --> 00:30:34.971
and write a research report ASAP.

00:30:35.570 --> 00:30:36.850
Okay. Time's tight. Let's...

00:30:36.850 --> 00:30:38.290
So should we

00:30:38.290 --> 00:30:39.411
elect a team leader first?

00:30:39.731 --> 00:30:41.330
The leader should

00:30:41.330 --> 00:30:42.290
be assigning the tasks.

00:30:45.971 --> 00:30:46.504
Well...

00:30:46.971 --> 00:30:48.171
Maybe I can try.

00:30:49.211 --> 00:30:50.971
You two have been performing well.

00:30:51.451 --> 00:30:52.931
I've been ranking lower.

00:30:52.971 --> 00:30:54.530
I'll likely be eliminated this round.

00:30:55.330 --> 00:30:56.211
But if I could

00:30:56.211 --> 00:30:57.171
be team lead this time,

00:30:57.731 --> 00:30:58.770
even if I leave,

00:30:59.211 --> 00:31:00.290
I'd have no regrets.

00:31:01.251 --> 00:31:02.370
Don't overthink it.

00:31:03.171 --> 00:31:04.251
I'm fine with it.

00:31:05.691 --> 00:31:06.370
Same.

00:31:08.171 --> 00:31:08.872
Alright.

00:31:09.011 --> 00:31:10.491
If no objections, Huang Yue leads.

00:31:11.251 --> 00:31:12.130
I should go now.

00:31:12.530 --> 00:31:13.530
Complete it quickly.

00:31:13.731 --> 00:31:14.330
Finish that,

00:31:14.691 --> 00:31:16.251
everyone gets 10 base points.

00:31:16.530 --> 00:31:17.491
Top performer,

00:31:17.651 --> 00:31:18.530
like the leader,

00:31:18.810 --> 00:31:20.290
gets 10 bonus points.

00:31:20.731 --> 00:31:21.384
Understood?

00:31:22.411 --> 00:31:23.048
Good luck.

00:31:27.259 --> 00:31:29.704
(Case overview)

00:31:29.704 --> 00:31:30.290
Bye, Mr. Zhou.

00:31:38.691 --> 00:31:40.330
What Mr. Zhuang wants

00:31:40.850 --> 00:31:41.691
is research approach.

00:31:42.411 --> 00:31:43.251
I suggest

00:31:43.251 --> 00:31:45.330
using the conventional method.

00:31:46.011 --> 00:31:47.211
Legal regulations,

00:31:47.570 --> 00:31:49.171
then judicial precedents,

00:31:49.610 --> 00:31:50.691
then, at last,

00:31:50.691 --> 00:31:52.130
academic views.

00:31:52.731 --> 00:31:53.891
That's comprehensive.

00:31:55.491 --> 00:31:56.610
It's comprehensive,

00:31:57.251 --> 00:31:59.171
but maybe too broad.

00:31:59.891 --> 00:32:00.931
Mr. Zhou let us

00:32:00.931 --> 00:32:02.171
submit it as soon as possible.

00:32:02.570 --> 00:32:04.810
Using this exhaustive approach,

00:32:05.171 --> 00:32:06.610
we might run out of time.

00:32:06.971 --> 00:32:08.330
And the result

00:32:08.731 --> 00:32:09.770
may not be satisfying.

00:32:10.971 --> 00:32:11.810
I have a proposal.

00:32:12.651 --> 00:32:13.211
This time,

00:32:13.211 --> 00:32:14.290
let's prioritize

00:32:14.290 --> 00:32:15.411
case research.

00:32:15.691 --> 00:32:16.610
Focus all efforts.

00:32:16.850 --> 00:32:17.891
It might work better.

00:32:19.130 --> 00:32:21.251
But we're a civil-law system.

00:32:21.251 --> 00:32:22.530
Using this approach,

00:32:22.530 --> 00:32:23.731
we may overlook

00:32:23.731 --> 00:32:24.850
some important statutes.

00:32:27.931 --> 00:32:29.570
But conventional method

00:32:30.011 --> 00:32:31.570
lacks highlights.

00:32:32.290 --> 00:32:33.610
We're in Mr. Zhuang's group.

00:32:33.691 --> 00:32:34.570
We need to stand out.

00:32:35.290 --> 00:32:37.171
We need to excel

00:32:37.451 --> 00:32:39.251
and impress Mr. Zhuang.

00:32:40.251 --> 00:32:40.872
Right?

00:32:44.931 --> 00:32:45.530
Leader,

00:32:46.090 --> 00:32:46.891
you decide.

00:32:50.011 --> 00:32:50.600
Okay.

00:32:51.370 --> 00:32:52.011
Let's begin.

00:33:08.491 --> 00:33:09.000
Xiaoyu.

00:33:10.090 --> 00:33:11.211
What's got you so excited?

00:33:12.731 --> 00:33:14.570
I can finally cross something

00:33:14.570 --> 00:33:16.530
off my career bucket list.

00:33:16.530 --> 00:33:17.090
That is...

00:33:17.610 --> 00:33:18.491
My first

00:33:19.330 --> 00:33:19.912
business trip.

00:33:20.570 --> 00:33:21.971
You're going to meet clients?

00:33:23.330 --> 00:33:24.891
Mr. Song is so nice!

00:33:25.491 --> 00:33:27.211
We're still grinding through research,

00:33:27.491 --> 00:33:28.530
and you get to travel.

00:33:29.090 --> 00:33:29.691
I'm jealous.

00:33:29.850 --> 00:33:31.290
It's just due diligence work.

00:33:31.290 --> 00:33:32.251
I'll be an assistant.

00:33:32.491 --> 00:33:33.211
Same as you.

00:33:33.530 --> 00:33:35.171
If I complete it, I'll get 10 points.

00:33:35.691 --> 00:33:37.130
If I do it well,

00:33:37.130 --> 00:33:37.891
another 10 points.

00:33:38.370 --> 00:33:39.491
But most importantly,

00:33:40.211 --> 00:33:41.850
my destination this time is

00:33:42.850 --> 00:33:43.691
Hangzhou.

00:33:45.651 --> 00:33:46.691
No wonder.

00:33:47.011 --> 00:33:48.931
You're going to see your Zhubao.

00:33:50.130 --> 00:33:52.290
I'm going to work!

00:33:52.290 --> 00:33:53.330
I'm not that lovesick,

00:33:53.330 --> 00:33:54.931
just wanting to see my boyfriend.

00:33:56.090 --> 00:33:57.491
My parents too.

00:33:58.211 --> 00:33:58.971
You'd better do.

00:33:59.611 --> 00:34:00.211
(Guo Xiaoyu)

00:34:00.211 --> 00:34:01.050
(Zhubao,)

00:34:01.251 --> 00:34:03.050
(I'll go to Hangzhou tomorrow for work.)

00:34:03.290 --> 00:34:05.171
(After finishing up,
it's Mid-Autumn break.)

00:34:05.290 --> 00:34:06.891
(Let's visit Fuchun River together.)

00:34:07.171 --> 00:34:08.971
(I found a trending vacation rental.)

00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:26.491
(Zhubao)
(Guo Xiaoyu.)

00:34:26.730 --> 00:34:28.891
(Why make plans without telling me?)

00:34:29.371 --> 00:34:30.491
(What if I have work?)

00:34:30.971 --> 00:34:32.210
(Your career gets priority)

00:34:32.650 --> 00:34:33.610
(but mine doesn't?)

00:34:33.971 --> 00:34:35.650
(Guo Xiaoyu)
(Sorry, sweetie.)

00:34:36.210 --> 00:34:37.291
(So, are you free to go?)

00:34:41.416 --> 00:34:42.216
(Zhubao)
(Alright.)

00:34:55.130 --> 00:34:55.971
Ms. Bai.

00:34:55.971 --> 00:34:57.050
Regarding my assignment

00:34:57.050 --> 00:34:58.050
about compiling notes,

00:34:58.050 --> 00:34:59.210
I've had new perspectives.

00:34:59.771 --> 00:35:02.130
Here's the defense statement I prepared.
Please review it.

00:35:03.331 --> 00:35:04.650
I asked you to extract evidence

00:35:04.650 --> 00:35:06.050
from the original trial records.

00:35:06.050 --> 00:35:06.771
Are you done?

00:35:07.090 --> 00:35:08.730
Not yet. But I believe

00:35:08.931 --> 00:35:10.610
the ultimate purpose of case file review

00:35:10.610 --> 00:35:12.530
is to draft compelling legal arguments.

00:35:12.552 --> 00:35:13.170
Therefore...

00:35:13.170 --> 00:35:14.411
Take it and redo the review.

00:35:17.451 --> 00:35:19.570
This is your first task in my team.

00:35:20.011 --> 00:35:21.891
If you can't handle basic case reviews,

00:35:22.170 --> 00:35:24.011
you won't get points
for this assignment.

00:35:25.730 --> 00:35:26.376
And

00:35:26.690 --> 00:35:27.931
any physical copies

00:35:28.050 --> 00:35:29.530
must be shredded immediately.

00:35:29.650 --> 00:35:31.931
Never discard client information.

00:35:37.771 --> 00:35:38.411
Thanks, Ms. Bai.

00:36:08.491 --> 00:36:09.530
Still upset with yourself?

00:36:10.152 --> 00:36:10.690
Mr. Zhou.

00:36:10.690 --> 00:36:11.451
Sit down.

00:36:11.491 --> 00:36:12.168
Continue.

00:36:13.011 --> 00:36:13.610
A Soulslike?

00:36:13.771 --> 00:36:15.050
Challenging. I like that too.

00:36:15.491 --> 00:36:16.168
Really?

00:36:18.371 --> 00:36:19.170
Are you the type

00:36:19.530 --> 00:36:21.130
who enjoys challenging games?

00:36:22.971 --> 00:36:23.891
Kind of.

00:36:23.891 --> 00:36:25.650
If a game isn't challenging,

00:36:25.650 --> 00:36:27.291
it feels boring to play.

00:36:28.811 --> 00:36:29.416
Alright.

00:36:30.530 --> 00:36:31.210
Back to work.

00:36:31.451 --> 00:36:32.011
Go home early.

00:36:32.570 --> 00:36:33.128
Okay.

00:36:35.891 --> 00:36:37.291
This level isn't too hard, right?

00:36:39.570 --> 00:36:40.168
Not at all.

00:36:40.411 --> 00:36:41.096
Good.

00:36:41.730 --> 00:36:42.312
See you.

00:36:59.291 --> 00:37:00.690
What's up with Jiang Chen today?

00:37:01.130 --> 00:37:02.371
After leaving Ms. Bai's office,

00:37:02.371 --> 00:37:03.610
he looked awful.

00:37:03.730 --> 00:37:04.971
He barely talked all day.

00:37:05.530 --> 00:37:06.851
Did Ms. Bai scold him again?

00:37:07.811 --> 00:37:09.491
His proposal got overruled by Ms. Bai.

00:37:09.891 --> 00:37:11.851
The only task she gave is

00:37:12.011 --> 00:37:13.331
to review and extract evidence.

00:37:14.130 --> 00:37:14.771
Wait.

00:37:14.771 --> 00:37:16.891
Isn't taking initiative good?

00:37:18.170 --> 00:37:20.090
Ms. Bai's ways are so puzzling.

00:37:20.730 --> 00:37:21.451
Exactly.

00:37:22.570 --> 00:37:24.170
Not sure what she really wants.

00:37:27.050 --> 00:37:28.090
What's wrong with you?

00:37:29.090 --> 00:37:30.851
You act like you've got a crush.

00:37:31.011 --> 00:37:33.011
Guessing what Ms. Bai likes

00:37:33.011 --> 00:37:35.250
and what she wants all day.

00:37:39.851 --> 00:37:41.130
I'm just playing up

00:37:41.690 --> 00:37:42.891
to my boss.

00:37:43.931 --> 00:37:45.891
When she gets in a good mood someday,

00:37:45.891 --> 00:37:47.530
maybe she'll take me to meet clients.

00:37:51.210 --> 00:37:52.811
Jiatong, look at this.

00:37:54.411 --> 00:37:55.250
This top

00:37:56.170 --> 00:37:57.291
with this mini skirt.

00:37:57.650 --> 00:37:58.210
Cute?

00:38:00.291 --> 00:38:00.968
Very cute.

00:38:01.811 --> 00:38:03.610
But are you going on a runway?

00:38:03.610 --> 00:38:05.610
Four days. A whole suitcase of clothes.

00:38:06.690 --> 00:38:07.570
You know it.

00:38:07.690 --> 00:38:09.491
After I stood Zhubao up last time,

00:38:09.690 --> 00:38:11.250
we were in a silent fight for long.

00:38:11.771 --> 00:38:13.210
I used all energy

00:38:13.210 --> 00:38:14.250
to finally coax him back.

00:38:14.891 --> 00:38:17.050
Now I'm going on a business trip back,

00:38:17.250 --> 00:38:19.050
just in time for Mid-Autumn Festival.

00:38:19.530 --> 00:38:21.090
I must dress up nice

00:38:21.090 --> 00:38:22.050
and spend time with him.

00:38:23.210 --> 00:38:24.690
Will you go home for the holiday?

00:38:26.250 --> 00:38:26.856
Yes.

00:38:27.811 --> 00:38:28.491
I miss my dad.

00:38:49.331 --> 00:38:50.931
Even Xiaoyu's out meeting clients,

00:38:50.931 --> 00:38:52.130
while we're reviewing files.

00:38:52.411 --> 00:38:54.090
That's unfair.

00:38:55.610 --> 00:38:58.331
Given your suspicious behavior
of complaining while reviewing,

00:38:59.011 --> 00:38:59.891
I strongly suggest you

00:38:59.931 --> 00:39:01.530
check your mental health.

00:39:01.971 --> 00:39:02.690
It is said

00:39:02.891 --> 00:39:05.491
that aggressive behavior might be
a sign of schizophrenia.

00:39:09.170 --> 00:39:11.050
You're starting to talk like Ms. Bai.

00:39:15.170 --> 00:39:16.170
I am losing it.

00:39:17.811 --> 00:39:20.851
Back then, I joined Ms. Bai's team

00:39:21.170 --> 00:39:22.851
to learn how to handle cases.

00:39:23.170 --> 00:39:24.451
But what I'm doing now is

00:39:24.451 --> 00:39:26.570
extracting info from hundreds of files

00:39:26.570 --> 00:39:27.690
and typing text

00:39:27.690 --> 00:39:28.530
like a clerk.

00:39:29.331 --> 00:39:30.851
I, a Haryald grad, was not majored

00:39:30.851 --> 00:39:32.250
in typing.

00:39:33.291 --> 00:39:34.331
I want to handle cases.

00:39:36.411 --> 00:39:37.650
Had I known this,

00:39:37.771 --> 00:39:39.411
I should've joined Mr. Song's team.

00:39:40.491 --> 00:39:41.210
If so...

00:39:41.210 --> 00:39:42.291
If you don't want to stay,

00:39:42.291 --> 00:39:43.371
you can leave anytime.

00:39:45.891 --> 00:39:47.411
I won't mind if you switch teams.

00:39:51.491 --> 00:39:52.072
Ms. Bai.

00:39:52.250 --> 00:39:52.904
Ms. Bai.

00:39:53.170 --> 00:39:54.690
The meeting minutes with Mr. Liu

00:39:54.690 --> 00:39:55.411
are finished.

00:39:55.771 --> 00:39:56.530
I have some points

00:39:56.530 --> 00:39:57.530
to confirm with you.

00:40:21.650 --> 00:40:22.312
Let's go

00:40:22.610 --> 00:40:23.530
to coffee. My treat.

00:40:28.090 --> 00:40:30.090
I reviewed your research report.

00:40:30.491 --> 00:40:31.130
More than once.

00:40:35.690 --> 00:40:36.610
To be honest,

00:40:37.931 --> 00:40:38.690
it's not great.

00:40:42.371 --> 00:40:43.011
I can tell

00:40:44.210 --> 00:40:46.451
you've reviewed many judicial cases,

00:40:47.011 --> 00:40:48.971
but your legal framework

00:40:49.291 --> 00:40:50.210
is way off.

00:40:51.811 --> 00:40:52.891
In your report,

00:40:53.931 --> 00:40:55.170
you missed a key document.

00:40:56.411 --> 00:40:57.650
The Trial Guidelines

00:40:57.891 --> 00:40:59.971
for Civil Trade Secret Disputes.

00:41:00.250 --> 00:41:01.371
It clearly explains

00:41:02.130 --> 00:41:04.411
whether information

00:41:04.610 --> 00:41:07.090
in a client list

00:41:07.931 --> 00:41:09.371
counts as trade secrets.

00:41:10.411 --> 00:41:10.920
That

00:41:12.090 --> 00:41:13.650
is the key to solving the problem.

00:41:15.570 --> 00:41:16.210
In my view,

00:41:16.210 --> 00:41:17.130
since this case

00:41:17.730 --> 00:41:19.210
occurred in Nanjing,

00:41:19.811 --> 00:41:21.210
they'll definitely

00:41:21.210 --> 00:41:24.291
refer to and follow that guideline.

00:41:27.170 --> 00:41:27.784
Tell me

00:41:29.371 --> 00:41:30.811
about your research approach.

00:41:31.491 --> 00:41:32.650
How did you think it through?

00:41:44.170 --> 00:41:44.840
Mr. Zhuang.

00:41:45.090 --> 00:41:46.570
The research framework was set

00:41:46.570 --> 00:41:47.411
by the three of us.

00:41:57.628 --> 00:41:58.824
(Unfair Competition Research Report)

00:42:11.411 --> 00:42:12.008
Huang Yue.

00:42:14.451 --> 00:42:15.931
You asked to be the leader this time.

00:42:18.690 --> 00:42:20.331
And the research plan was set by you.

00:42:22.371 --> 00:42:23.411
Why didn't you say that?

00:42:25.530 --> 00:42:26.690
I know I messed up.

00:42:27.331 --> 00:42:29.530
I didn't mean to drag you two down.

00:42:30.650 --> 00:42:32.291
I was just scared.

00:42:33.570 --> 00:42:34.931
I've been ranking lower.

00:42:35.291 --> 00:42:37.771
If Mr. Zhuang knew it was on me,

00:42:38.530 --> 00:42:39.971
I'd be done.

00:42:41.971 --> 00:42:42.771
Enough, Li Ke.

00:42:43.491 --> 00:42:45.011
This was teamwork.

00:42:45.451 --> 00:42:47.210
It's not fair for her
to take all the blame.

00:42:47.570 --> 00:42:48.730
Mr. Zhuang didn't scold us.

00:42:49.210 --> 00:42:50.011
Don't overthink it.

00:42:50.730 --> 00:42:52.411
It's not overthinking. It's the rule.

00:42:53.291 --> 00:42:55.011
She's the leader.
She'd get 10 extra points

00:42:55.210 --> 00:42:56.931
if she did well.

00:42:58.011 --> 00:42:59.170
But since she messed up,

00:42:59.170 --> 00:43:00.690
shouldn't she take responsibility?

00:43:02.491 --> 00:43:04.411
If you want to play nice, fine.

00:43:05.210 --> 00:43:07.688
But don't do that on my behalf,

00:43:07.720 --> 00:43:08.291
okay?

00:43:08.291 --> 00:43:09.291
We're different.

00:43:15.356 --> 00:43:16.923
("Multiple causes, one result"
in traffic accidents)

00:43:16.923 --> 00:43:18.984
(Answer: It means a single injury)

00:43:18.984 --> 00:43:20.488
(was caused by multiple factors.)

00:43:20.488 --> 00:43:22.632
(In such cases,
each factor must be analyzed)

00:43:22.632 --> 00:43:24.872
(regarding their influence, connection,)

00:43:24.872 --> 00:43:27.784
(and fault levels
to divide liability accordingly.)
