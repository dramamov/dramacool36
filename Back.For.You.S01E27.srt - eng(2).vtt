00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.280
Are you trying to say

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.280
you like me

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.240
Are you trying to say you like me

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:24.240
Yes

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:31.480
Then

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.440
How long have you liked me

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.200
How long

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.360
Since

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:39.920
Hello, everyone

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:40.800
My name is Su Ruo

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.000
I love music and reading

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.120
Glad to join Class 3, Grade One

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.160
I hope in the next three years

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.440
we can all become friends

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:57.720
Since

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:00.280
the very first glance

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:02.640
The first glance

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.840
You've liked me for three years

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:09.480
Eighteen years

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:11.120
Eighteen years

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.120
You liked me since you were born

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.680
That's not what I meant

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.400
What I mean is

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.440
No matter how much time passes

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.680
I still can't help but

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.600
want to be with you always

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:30.360
Yu Xingchen

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.520
I only want to be with you too

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.440
Now I do

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.240
And always will

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.280
Because

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:53.520
I like you

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.960
Yu Xingchen

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.520
Did you hear what I said

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:27.320
I'm back

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.160
Su Ruo

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:31.880
Su Ruo is still alive, right

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.560
Hello

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:38.040
Where are you

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:38.480
I

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:39.480
Where are you

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:41.080
I'm at the cemetery

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:03.480
I have a habit

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.160
After the homicide case

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.240
I always pay respects to the victim

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.120
Even the date of death hasn't changed

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.920
Why hasn't anything changed this time

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.360
Is she still with Ren Nan

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:19.600
Or

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:22.880
What do you mean "or"

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.960
Before Su Ruo's accident

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.320
Was she still with Ren Nan

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.960
No

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.000
A year ago

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:33.960
Ren Nan met Su Ruo

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.040
He started pursuing Su Ruo

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.720
Just like back in school

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.400
But Su Ruo never agreed

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:44.520
But you know

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:46.640
When two people are alone

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:48.680
It's easy to be seen

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:51.360
And misunderstandings happen

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.120
What misunderstanding

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.920
Ren Nan's fiancée always held a grudge

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:00.000
Fiancée

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:02.480
Lou Yuting

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:04.280
You mean

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:05.720
Lou Yuting found out

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.280
about Ren Nan pestering Su Ruo

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:09.480
It was a misunderstanding

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:12.880
Anyway, that night

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:16.160
Lou Yuting's brother brought some people

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.080
to block Su Ruo

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:19.360
Maybe tried to use the railing

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:20.520
to climb down

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:24.760
So

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.760
Su Ruo was startled and

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:28.240
accidentally fell

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:38.480
I understand now

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:41.320
I stopped them from being together

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.360
But I didn't change their reunion

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.160
Nor Lou Yuting's hatred

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:49.400
Except for their romance

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:52.560
Even Su Ruo's death

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:55.160
was exactly the same

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:07.760
Chen

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:10.360
How have you been lately

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:14.160
So-so

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:16.840
My dad mentioned recently

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:18.720
He always tells me

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:21.760
there's a classmate named Yu Xingchen

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:23.480
who's really impressive

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:26.160
You should learn from him

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:36.920
Didn't you become a singer

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:37.840
Why are you still

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:39.400
involved with Lou Yuting

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.560
Do you need her help as a singer

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.320
Maybe I really have no talent for music

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:51.960
Releasing a single online needs traffic

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:53.880
Getting on the charts costs money

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:55.400
But at that time

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:57.760
only Lou Yuting said she liked my music

00:06:58.240 --> 00:06:59.560
admired my talent

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:01.600
and was willing to help me release a song

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:06.400
Before we knew it

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:08.600
we were about to get married

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:23.960
Chen

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:25.320
I used to think

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:26.960
Su Ruo was already with you

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:28.560
But I found out later

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:30.240
she's been single all these years

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:32.360
I just wanted to see if she's doing well

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:34.080
see if there's anything I can do for her

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:36.560
I really didn't mean to two-time

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:39.640
Chen

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:41.720
I don't understand

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:44.360
Su Ruo clearly liked you so much then

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:46.000
Couldn't you see it

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:47.600
But why did you later

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:48.960
become like a different person

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:50.640
and keep your distance from her

00:07:57.760 --> 00:07:59.520
That summer she didn't get into college

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:02.480
She was sad all summer

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:03.840
What about you

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:05.960
You acted like nothing happened

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:08.360
Even Zhang Xun went to comfort her

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:10.560
But you didn't say a word to comfort her

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:14.800
Why didn't you get together with her

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:16.520
I just don't get it

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:17.440
Why

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:26.520
Forget it, Chen

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:31.680
Who am I to judge you

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:34.560
After all, it's because I was engaged and still bothered her

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:37.800
that things turned out this way

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:41.880
It's all my fault

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:20.840
I wanted an Americano.

00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:23.240
Why did you bring two lattes?

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:25.920
I can't tell them apart.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:27.920
Let me put it this way.

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:29.880
A single drop of milk

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:31.960
is enough to make black coffee cloudy.

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:34.440
Even a tiny outside influence

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:36.560
can blur the truth.

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:40.320
What is the pure truth you seek?

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:42.320
No one really knows.

00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:43.640
What are you referring to?

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:45.600
Are you talking about Su Ruo's case?

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:46.880
Su Ruo's case

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:48.480
has many uncertainties.

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:51.000
And in your novel,

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:52.840
there are also many uncertainties.

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:54.200
What a coincidence.

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:56.320
Your novel and Su Ruo's case

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:57.360
are somehow connected.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.240
What's even stranger

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:01.040
is that your novel

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:02.840
even mentions time travel.

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:06.880
I don't know among these

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:08.560
which is real

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.200
and which is fake.

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:12.560
Suddenly, I thought

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:15.440
you scored over five hundred on the college entrance exam.

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:18.440
From over one fifty to over five hundred.

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:21.960
At first, I thought you scored low on purpose.

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:22.800
But then I reconsidered.

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:24.080
No, that's not it.

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:26.240
You got into Dongda Physics later.

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:27.320
With your intelligence,

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:28.880
I feel like

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:32.120
there are two of you.

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:35.920
Yu Xingchen,

00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:38.080
what you said to Ren Nan,

00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:39.400
I want to say to you as well.

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:41.240
Don't challenge me.

00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:42.880
And don't hide things from me.

00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:46.280
If you don't plan to tell me the truth,

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:48.800
then I'll just put these two cloudy coffees

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:49.560
in front of you.

00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:51.480
You pick which one you want.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.440
I am hiding something from you.

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:56.800
But I'm still not sure

00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:57.720
if I can tell you.

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:03.840
These are the possible causes

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:06.080
of Su Ruo's death I've been considering.

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:07.840
There were over ten at first.

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:10.000
But every time I talk to you,

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.360
I rule out a few.

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:13.360
Now, after ruling out,

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:15.320
only one possibility remains.

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:19.160
Of course, the truth may not be this.

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:21.480
But if you're interested,

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:23.520
feel free to take a look.

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:34.560
I didn't expect

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:37.160
you'd care so much about Su Ruo.

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:40.960
Solving puzzles is my joy.

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:42.360
Give me some time.

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:44.840
If I think it's right,

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:47.040
I'll tell you the secret I've been hiding.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.240
The part you're hiding,

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:52.040
I've guessed over thirty possibilities.

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:54.360
After ruling them out one by one,

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:56.240
only three remain.

00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:57.480
So,

00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:58.680
hurry up.

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:00.960
Tell me before I figure it out.

00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:01.920
Let me know.

00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:09.840
After Su Ruo left you at the physiotherapy clinic,

00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:10.560
she went home,

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:12.200
then to the time of her death.

00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:14.320
Not much time passed in between.

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:26.120
Based on this,

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:27.680
Su Ruo received the letter

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:29.440
about half an hour before the incident.

00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:32.800
When the police collected evidence,

00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:34.280
Ren Nan's letter

00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:35.600
was still intact on the table.

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:36.560
This means the letter

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:37.560
was read not long before the incident.

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:38.680
Su Ruo had just finished reading it.

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:42.320
You had a letter in the mailbox.

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:43.080
No name on it.

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:44.840
I thought it was for you.

00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:45.840
So I put it on the table.

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:50.120
She didn't even have time to put the letter away.

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:54.560
Su Ruo definitely didn't contact Ren Nan.

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:57.200
Because if she had called Ren Nan,

00:12:57.680 --> 00:12:58.600
the police

00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:00.280
would have found Ren Nan immediately.

00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:04.520
Why did Su Ruo leave her home

00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:05.840
and go to the rooftop?

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:06.760
This point

00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:08.280
confused me at first.

00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:10.400
But I checked the news that day

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:11.200
and found something.

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:12.560
Perseid meteor shower

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:15.440
would peak on the night of the twelfth.

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:17.280
The public could watch it on the twelfth night.

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:19.520
I remember Su Ruo loved meteors.

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:20.360
Of course,

00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:21.880
this is just my own guess.

00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:22.720
If there are meteors,

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:41.720
never give up.

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:46.200
Outstanding people have goals.

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:49.920
Others only have wishes.

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:54.320
You cannot change the past,

00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:59.440
but you can make your future better.

00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:05.560
You cannot change the past,

00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:08.640
but you can make your future better.
