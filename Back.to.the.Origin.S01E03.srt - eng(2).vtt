00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:39.840
I heard you.

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:44.759
Okay. I heard you.

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:45.240
Okay?

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.920
Hello. Hello.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.920
One two. One two. One two.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:49.520
Hello everybody.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:50.880
Hello everyone,

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:51.440
welcome to

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:52.600
Today's Financial Interview.

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:53.680
I'm your host, Zhang Ran.

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.360
Today, we're honored to have

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.120
the founder of North America's Mired,

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.880
a quantum computing software company,

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.040
here as part of a business delegation

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.280
to share insights

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.840
on the current

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:03.920
international market

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.040
and his outlook

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.280
on global economic trends.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.120
Let's welcome

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.199
Mr. Sean Montefiore.

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.160
We believe that in the near future,

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.200
China is bound to

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.640
play a more significant role

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.000
in the Pacific Rim Economic Circle.

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.160
Thank you for watching

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.320
Today's Financial Interview.

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:31.280
I'm Zhang Ran.

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.760
See you next time.

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:41.720
Fu Yudong, the fish got away!

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.720
Leave it there.

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:43.160
I'll catch it.

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:43.720
Wait.

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:44.240
I've got it.

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.480
Well,

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:48.200
leave it there. Don't move.

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.920
Let me just put this down,

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:49.400
then I'll grab it.

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:51.320
I can catch it.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:53.280
Okay.

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:56.120
Alright.

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:00.520
Come on.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.880
Come on.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:05.720
Okay. Let's go.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.320
Hurry!

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:08.240
Come on.

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:15.080
Where's the fish?

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:19.079
It jumped.

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:25.160
It's fine.

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:45.320
I...

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.320
I need to use the bathroom

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.920
to wash my hands.

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.960
Sure. Go ahead.

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.600
Um, Fu Yudong,

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:08.440
can I just

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:09.120
take a shower here?

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.160
You live really close by.

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.680
I want to take a shower here.

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:23.880
Is that okay?

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:29.720
Okay.

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:11.800
What's wrong?

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:13.840
Nothing. Just a cockroach.

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:16.120
Uh...

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:17.880
Turn right for hot water.

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:18.720
Don't get it wrong.

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.320
I changed it. It was broken.

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.000
Unbelievable. Why did you change it?

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:14.600
I... I'm a little sleepy.

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:19.640
You sleepy too?

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:23.360
I...

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:24.880
Yes.

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:27.400
Good.

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:18.920
It's fine.

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:20.440
If... If you don't want to do it,

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:21.120
that's okay.

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:21.960
Tomorrow...

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:22.640
No, no. I...

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:24.560
I want to.

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:40.080
Don't... Don't tell me

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:41.280
you have no experience.

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:42.360
I do.

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:45.720
I've done my research.

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:56.040
Well, you'll be fine.

00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:56.920
I trust

00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:58.200
a PhD's ability to learn.

00:08:58.480 --> 00:08:59.160
Come on.

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:24.480
What's wrong?

00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:27.960
Just sudden

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:31.200
stomach cramps.

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:34.160
Maybe another time.

00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:34.720
Another time.

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:36.200
It's fine. Doesn't matter.

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:40.440
Come on.

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:47.160
I really know how.

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:48.360
Okay.

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:21.680
Alright. Uh,

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:22.680
well,

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:24.400
there's something

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:25.920
I need to tell you.

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:29.080
My family...

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:32.040
I mean,

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:35.920
I'm from a single-parent family.

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:38.560
You need to know that.

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:41.360
Is that all?

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:44.840
You...

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:46.760
You don't mind, do you?

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:51.880
I don't mind.

00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:56.600
Okay.

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:07.160
Happy to be here.

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:11.920
Okay.

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:17.160
Sorry, I need a drink.

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:17.880
Don't.

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:18.760
You've had enough.

00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:19.480
That's plenty.

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:43.120
If there's no fish, just let it go.

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:44.400
I got a bite.

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:50.160
I was just talking to you.

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:50.960
Did you hear me or not?

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:53.400
You're going to be a personal shopper?

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:54.920
Yeah, I've made up my mind.

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:56.640
Lately, many have been asking

00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:58.160
if I can get stuff from overseas.

00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:00.160
So I made a side account

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:01.680
and used a fake name, Yuan.

00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:03.160
In less than two weeks,

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:04.520
guess how much I made?

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:05.600
How much?

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:06.480
Five thousand.

00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:09.680
That much?

00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:10.720
Pretty good, right?

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:12.360
So I've decided.

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:14.720
I'll use my main account for promotion,

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:16.160
and the side account for sales.

00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:17.680
That way I can make money

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:19.200
without losing face. Right?

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:21.040
You work so hard.

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:22.120
If I do

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:23.040
reselling,

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:24.640
our income could double.

00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:25.920
But

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:27.080
we both work cash jobs.

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:27.880
So

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:30.360
we still can't guarantee

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:31.520
the money for a house.

00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:33.040
We still have to

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:35.320
work hard and save up.

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:38.360
What's going on?

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:39.800
Reel it in.

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:40.880
Slow down.

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:44.360
Seems like she's really something.

00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:47.640
So how did she end up with you?

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:49.600
Have you thought about that?

00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:53.920
She really needs me, actually.

00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:57.240
Zhang Ran!

00:12:57.280 --> 00:12:57.800
Fu Yudong!

00:12:57.800 --> 00:12:59.720
Run! The house is on fire!

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:05.120
Here's that BBQ you wanted yesterday.

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:06.560
It's not burnt, is it?

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:08.720
No.

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:13.960
Fu Yudong, come help.

00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:15.320
Fu Yudong!

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:17.200
Coming!

00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:19.960
Now I think

00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:21.760
having someone around is pretty nice.

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:23.120
Zhang Ran talks a lot.

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:24.720
She calls for me

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:25.800
whenever she needs something.

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:27.920
Every time she calls my name,

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:29.600
it just makes me so happy.

00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:30.920
Really glad.

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:33.480
So you like people

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:34.760
calling your name?

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:37.920
And it has to be a host?

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:39.800
So you like people

00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:42.280
enunciating your name clearly.

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:44.040
That's weird, dude.

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:45.200
Okay.

00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:46.680
Anyway,

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:49.200
you've got skills. Not easy.

00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:51.360
The guys on our decoration crew

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:52.200
say the same thing.

00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:54.800
What's wrong?

00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:57.120
You sound a bit upset about it.

00:13:57.920 --> 00:13:59.640
Tell me what's on your mind.

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:01.440
Did you check her Moments?

00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:04.920
Yeah, I did. Why?

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:09.080
I always feel like

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:10.360
even though she's here,

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:11.720
her heart's still back home.

00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:13.920
Actually, back when

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:15.960
she was a host in China,

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:17.360
she was really successful.

00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:18.760
That's normal.

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:21.280
Well, I wouldn't call this lying.

00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:24.720
It's just pride getting in the way.

00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:27.640
We can overlook that.

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:28.960
True.

00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:30.320
Look at our decoration crew.

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:31.160
Back in China,

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:32.760
every one

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:33.520
of them

00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:35.000
was a big deal.

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:36.760
But here in Canada,

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:38.000
to be honest,

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:39.720
hardly any of them

00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:40.640
tell their

00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:41.920
old friends and family

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:42.960
what they're really doing here.

00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:49.360
Dong, let me tell you,

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:52.080
the past doesn't matter.

00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:54.560
The present is what counts.

00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:56.000
[Even so,]

00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:57.800
[I feel like]

00:14:58.360 --> 00:14:59.360
she should

00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:00.760
have a better life.

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:03.480
Every time I see her

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:04.920
checking out

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:05.760
the stuff she buys

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:06.640
for others,

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:08.520
it actually

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:11.360
bothers me.

00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:12.960
I keep thinking,

00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:14.760
I have to buy one of those

00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:15.400
for her.

00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:16.920
If other women have it,

00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:18.640
my wife should have it too.

00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:22.600
Does Cheng Man have one?

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:24.920
I'm asking you.

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:27.440
Cheng Man has me.

00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:34.200
He hung up.

00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:37.040
Hanging up on people is also

00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:40.000
a case of pride getting in the way.

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:46.360
[After Yuan Yuan left,]

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:48.720
[I went through a really dark week.]

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:51.720
[Thanks to Fu Yudong being there for me,]

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:52.880
[I slowly got back on my feet.]

00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:55.720
[Sometimes I wonder]

00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:58.520
[if I'm holding him back]

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:01.080
[and if he]

00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:02.320
[deserves a better life.]

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:05.440
[But he always comforts me,]

00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:07.520
[telling me to let the past be past]

00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:09.480
[and that what matters is now.]

00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:12.680
[I think he's right.]

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:15.520
[Nothing can beat me.]

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:17.880
[I've been through worse.]

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:18.840
[This is nothing.]

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:21.400
[My goal now]

00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:22.520
[is to make it.]

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:25.520
[I won't care what other people think.]

00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:27.840
[I'm gonna be the best personal shopper.]

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:28.800
[Who am I?]

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:32.360
[I'm the amazing Zhang Ran.]

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:01.320
Let's go.

00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:19.800
[Mao, here's the thing.]

00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:20.520
These shoes

00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:21.800
are a hot item.

00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:23.040
Only two pairs left.

00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:24.400
So I'm not sure

00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:26.160
I can grab them on clearance day.

00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:27.960
If you trust me,

00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:29.400
you can pay a deposit now.

00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:30.200
If I

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:31.160
can't get them,

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:32.760
I'll refund you.

00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:42.920
Sunscreen.

00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:43.920
Foundation.

00:17:58.480 --> 00:17:59.920
[Yuan, your voice]

00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:01.360
[sounds like that host]

00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:03.000
[from a finance show on TV.]

00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:09.520
Fu Yudong.

00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:10.840
Fu Yudong!

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:12.400
Hold on a sec. Let me reply.

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:15.960
No way.

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:16.720
TV hosts

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:17.600
have

00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:18.520
great voices.

00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:19.360
It's like this.

00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:20.680
Since you paid a deposit,

00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:22.680
I'll do my absolute best

00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:24.000
to get this order for you.

00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:26.160
Alright? Thanks for your support.

00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:33.960
Honey!

00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:36.800
I need your help now.

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:40.160
Between us, we don't have to

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:41.080
mention helping each other.

00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:42.320
Just tell me what to do!

00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:45.600
I love you!

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:47.840
Me too!

00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:52.840
[Honey, listen,]

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:54.200
[once the doors open,]

00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:55.160
[head straight]

00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:56.320
[to the back row.]

00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:57.240
[The row with big carts.]

00:18:57.280 --> 00:18:58.280
[Don't mind]

00:18:58.280 --> 00:18:58.760
[the ones up front.]

00:18:58.760 --> 00:18:59.680
[People will grab those.]

00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:00.720
But there aren't many in the back.

00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:02.440
Once you're in, ignore everything else.

00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:03.680
Go to the very back

00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:04.920
and get the flatbed ones.

00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:05.440
You'll know them.

00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:06.160
They're different from these.

00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:07.000
Got it?

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:09.800
Understand?

00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:11.320
The very back row!

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:14.280
Coming.

00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:15.160
Give it here.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:16.760
Let go.

00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:17.280
Come on.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:43.600
Fu Yudong!

00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:48.760
Quick! Give it to me.

00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:51.240
These two carts won't hold much.

00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:52.600
Go find another one.

00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:53.280
Not a small one.

00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:54.000
Get one like this.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:54.600
This one.

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:55.440
That's the right one.

00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:56.560
Honey, you're amazing. Go now.

00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:56.880
Okay.

00:19:58.120 --> 00:19:58.760
Get one like this!

00:19:58.960 --> 00:19:59.240
Okay.

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:17.960
It's really my size.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.040
Can I have it? I really like these shoes.

00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:22.120
I really need this size.

00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:23.640
Look, I even traded with you.

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:24.800
Just swap with me.

00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:25.400
It's the only pair I need.

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:26.680
Fu Yudong!

00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:27.840
No, no, no!

00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:30.000
No, no, no!

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:31.120
No! No!

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:35.600
Go get another one.

00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:36.880
What's that in your mouth?

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:38.760
It brings back childhood memories.

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:39.600
What am I doing?

00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:40.640
And what are you doing?

00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:42.440
Come here. Guard this.

00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:43.760
Honey, it's up to you

00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:44.440
to hold the line.

00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:44.960
Okay.

00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:45.720
So handsome.

00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:47.200
Please. Thank you.

00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:48.840
I really need this size.

00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:50.960
Where are my things?

00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:52.960
Where are my shoes? They were in a pile.

00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:54.680
Well, there was this girl

00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:55.200
looking so pitiful.

00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:56.600
She kept begging me.

00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:57.640
Who's more pitiful than me?

00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:00.960
You're here eating a popsicle, huh?

00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:02.200
Just get out of the way.

00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:03.320
Wait for me in the car.

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:04.600
Go on.

00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:05.880
I'll hold the spot.

00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:06.640
I won't let anyone take anything.

00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:07.200
Go away!

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:07.960
I will not let anyone take them.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:08.640
After all the trouble I went through...

00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:10.360
Can't take them. No.

00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:10.880
Just give me one pair.

00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:11.360
No, no, no!

00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:12.680
Look, you have so many already.

00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:14.840
Nice.

00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:17.240
I...

00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:18.240
Can I get one?

00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:20.160
I don't understand.

00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:22.600
No, no, no. No English.

00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:24.360
No English.

00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:28.800
For Mr. Wu Hanneng!

00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:30.240
Shipped out!

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:32.760
Great!

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:35.560
It can't fit.

00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:36.680
Bring it on. No problem.

00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:37.720
Another one.

00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:38.080
I'm awesome.

00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:38.960
I'm seriously awesome today.

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:40.480
Am I now the shining star

00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:41.720
of Chinese people in Canada?

00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:43.200
Honey, listen,

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:44.200
you should quit fixing pipes.

00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:45.040
From now on, you stick with me.

00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:45.840
We'll go snap up some deals.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:46.720
Before long,

00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:48.080
we can rent a bigger place.

00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:49.120
We'll each have our own room.

00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:51.080
I'm kinda hungry.

00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:52.520
Let's finish this then eat.

00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:54.080
Okay. I'll cook for you.

00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:55.640
No need to cook.

00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:56.360
I'll order the duck blood

00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:57.840
from Fuman Restaurant!

00:21:58.160 --> 00:21:58.880
So fancy?

00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:00.200
We're rich now!

00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:01.040
Stop that!

00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:01.880
Go open the champagne

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:03.520
your boss gave you.

00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:04.960
I want to hear that pop!

00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:05.960
Okay. Just a second.

00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:06.800
We're rich now!

00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:08.200
We're rich now!

00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:10.360
We're rich now!

00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:11.760
What should we spend it on?

00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:13.600
Let me see

00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:14.880
what to order.

00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:21.960
Let me see.

00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:39.640
Fu Yudong.

00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:45.400
Cheers!

00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:54.640
What happened to the celebration?

00:23:58.680 --> 00:23:59.520
Feeling unwell?

00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:45.760
That's just

00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:46.520
how life is.

00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:48.240
It's hard not to compare.

00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:49.600
You just have to come to terms with it.

00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:53.520
I don't see it that way.

00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:55.880
Hell is other people.

00:24:56.800 --> 00:24:58.440
No one can talk you out of this.

00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:00.240
She has to figure it out for herself.

00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:05.600
I'd say

00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:07.320
she's different from us.

00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:09.320
If she really had a choice,

00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:10.880
she'd want

00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:12.280
her old life back.

00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:14.280
It's not that easy to let go.

00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:15.080
Right?

00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:16.520
[Even if it's hard,]

00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:17.280
[you have to move on.]

00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:18.920
Not all opportunities

00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:19.960
will wait for you.

00:25:56.840 --> 00:25:57.320
Zhang Ran.

00:25:59.200 --> 00:25:59.800
Zhang Ran.

00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:02.520
Get up.

00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:04.280
The moon's up.

00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:06.280
You've been asleep for a full day.

00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:07.560
Get up and eat something.

00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:09.800
I don't want to, Honey.

00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:13.960
You'll hurt your stomach.

00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:15.360
Come on.

00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:17.000
Get up.

00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:18.040
No.

00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:19.320
Be good.

00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:19.960
No.

00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:21.560
Show you self!

00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:22.400
I don't want to eat.

00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:24.120
I don't want to.

00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:25.040
Get up.

00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:26.600
Feeling unwell?

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:30.280
Come on. Okay.

00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:31.600
One, two, three.

00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:32.520
I don't want to.

00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:33.240
Sit up.

00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:39.320
Coming.

00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:41.000
Here.

00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:42.840
This congee smells amazing.

00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:47.640
I told you so many times.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.000
You don't need to

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:50.400
go so hard to get the stuff.

00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:51.800
We're not

00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:53.080
that desperate.

00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:54.120
Why push yourself so hard?

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:55.840
You'll

00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:56.680
wear yourself out.

00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:04.400
I don't like plain congee. Tasteless.

00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:10.920
Easy fix.

00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:12.200
Here, let me add some flavor.

00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:34.200
Come on. Alright.

00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:37.000
If you're sad, spill the tea.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:39.680
It'll cheer me up.

00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:42.920
You're so annoying!

00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:45.360
Get out of here! Go away!

00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:46.920
Let me share the burden.

00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:47.520
No.

00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:48.080
Come on.

00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:48.640
No.

00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:49.520
Share a little.

00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:50.000
No.

00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:54.200
How could I go away?

00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:55.680
I'm stuck with you.

00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:57.600
Wherever you go, I'll follow you.

00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:00.200
Honey,

00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:04.160
I'm so jinxed!

00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:06.480
Are you kidding?

00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:09.360
You're so lucky to have me.

00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:15.160
Give me a hug.

00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:17.000
A hug will make it better.

00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:19.520
Come on.

00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:27.000
[Dear,]

00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:27.800
[your meme]

00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:29.280
[is just so funny.]

00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:30.640
[It's gone viral back home.]

00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:31.480
[I use it every day.]

00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:32.760
[So relatable.]

00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:33.760
[After I started using it,]

00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:34.280
[so many of my friends]

00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:35.280
[wanted to buy bags from you.]

00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:37.040
[I'll refer them all to you.]

00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:13.520
It's raining. Take the umbrella.

00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:15.000
Are you going out shopping today?

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:15.680
I'll pick you up.

00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:16.760
No. I'm staying home.

00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:18.160
Take it.

00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:20.080
Your cowlick always

00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:21.360
has a mind of its own.

00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:22.960
Don't forget your hat.

00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:25.880
Take the umbrella.

00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:27.200
Here.

00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:28.320
No need.

00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:28.960
Take it. Hurry!

00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:29.440
It'll get in the way while I work.

00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:30.120
It's raining.

00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:32.240
For heaven's sake.

00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:38.160
You shut the door

00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:38.680
that easily?

00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:40.280
Shut it gentle.

00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:42.200
Close it again.

00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:46.320
What?

00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:48.800
Bye.

00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:49.520
Bye, Honey.

00:30:56.760 --> 00:30:57.920
[Hello, dear.]

00:30:58.040 --> 00:30:58.840
[It should be morning]

00:30:58.840 --> 00:30:59.960
[in Toronto now.]

00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:01.240
[You've had a day to think about it.]

00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:03.120
[Have you made up your mind yet?]

00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:04.360
Let me tell you a story.

00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:06.000
I don't want to hear it.

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:07.560
I just thought of a story.

00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:09.920
In a mental hospital,

00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:11.160
there was a guy

00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:13.120
who always crouched in the yard

00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:14.400
holding an umbrella

00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:15.920
every single day.

00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:17.600
Later, a doctor wondered

00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:18.600
what he was doing

00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:20.400
and

00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:21.520
decided to find out.

00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:23.200
The doctor started holding an umbrella

00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:25.360
with him every day.

00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:26.520
Wherever that guy crouched,

00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:27.920
the doctor would crouch there too.

00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:29.000
After three whole days,

00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:29.880
that guy

00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:31.000
finally spoke.

00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:31.960
You know what he said?

00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:33.160
He said,

00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:37.400
"are you a mushroom too?"

00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:44.200
What are you doing?

00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:44.800
There you go.

00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:45.800
Where are you going?

00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:47.240
Now I'm the dark cloud over your head.

00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:48.640
See how light I am.

00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:49.800
Watch me. Let's go.

00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:50.760
Go.

00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:52.600
I'm taking off now.

00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:55.760
See these threads?

00:31:56.800 --> 00:31:57.520
The threads.

00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:00.360
They go this way.

00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:01.000
See?

00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:03.800
So the plumber's tape

00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:05.320
has to

00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:08.200
be wrapped against the thread direction.

00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:10.240
Only then,

00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:11.960
when you

00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:15.000
screw it onto the other side,

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:16.880
will the tape hold properly.

00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:21.200
Well,

00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:22.040
simply put,

00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:23.640
If you hold it with your left hand,

00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:25.360
you turn it this way.

00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:26.040
Outward.

00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:28.520
When you hold it with your right hand,

00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:30.200
you turn it inward.

00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:32.960
Don't underestimate this tape.

00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:36.480
It's antiseptic, waterproof, and durable.

00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:38.240
They even use it on submarines.

00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:40.320
Here, you try.

00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:44.360
Come on.

00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:51.000
Did you get your degree here?

00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:51.760
Yeah.

00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:54.560
And you ended up doing this?

00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:55.640
Shouldn't you have a job

00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:57.200
related to your major?

00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:00.040
That's what I thought at first.

00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:02.520
I thought this job

00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:03.520
was just temporary.

00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:04.840
And once I found

00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:05.760
the right job,

00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:07.240
I'd quit being a decorator.

00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:08.800
But later, I found myself

00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:09.400
starting

00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:10.560
to enjoy it.

00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:12.720
I realized that every day,

00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:13.800
what I do

00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:15.800
is fix things, dismantle things,

00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:17.440
or build things.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:19.280
It's all tangible

00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:20.320
and concrete.

00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:21.920
And it seems

00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:25.600
I can actually help the clients.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:26.520
At the very least,

00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:27.240
I can help them live

00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:28.200
more comfortably.

00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:30.840
Then I thought about the past.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:32.640
I've written so many papers

00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:34.040
and spent so much time

00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:34.960
and effort.

00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:35.680
In the end,

00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:36.960
I don't even know

00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:37.840
who read those papers.

00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:39.080
You know what I mean?

00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:44.240
I was really lucky

00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:45.680
when I was young.

00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:47.560
My first feature film

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:49.600
won at the Hukedan International...

00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:52.360
Never mind. You don't know it.

00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:52.800
Anyway, it's a

00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:54.040
pretty influential

00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:55.320
international indie film festival.

00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:57.200
I won the Best Newcomer Award.

00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:00.480
After the screening,

00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:01.800
everyone in the theater

00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:03.040
stood up and applauded.

00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:05.320
It went on for over 3 minutes.

00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:06.680
I can still

00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:07.920
almost hear it

00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:08.600
in my ears.

00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:13.480
Back then, I thought

00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:14.400
I had made it.

00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:15.159
You know?

00:34:17.199 --> 00:34:17.960
Right after,

00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:21.199
with dreams of becoming a great director,

00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:22.560
I made my second film.

00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:24.520
It flopped.

00:34:25.679 --> 00:34:26.520
So I borrowed money

00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:28.280
to make a third one.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:34.520
But not even anyone

00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:36.440
wrote a critique to trash it.

00:34:44.719 --> 00:34:45.360
It's okay.

00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:48.080
Look at our decoration crew.

00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:49.800
Every one of us

00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:51.120
had a glorious past.

00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:54.560
The one on the ladder,

00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:55.679
looking like a monkey,

00:34:55.840 --> 00:34:56.760
is Mr. Zhu.

00:34:57.120 --> 00:34:58.600
The one who just carried the wood by

00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:00.200
was a chief surgeon.

00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:02.120
So what?

00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:04.560
Now we're all here together,

00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:06.080
working happily

00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:07.000
and making money.

00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:09.280
Being a decorator

00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:10.800
might not look that respectable.

00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:12.600
But

00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:13.680
it's honestly not that hard.

00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:16.360
And the pay isn't bad.

00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:17.640
Enough to live on.

00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:19.600
Contentment brings happiness.

00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:21.320
Since we're here, let's just settle in.

00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:27.400
Life leaves traces everywhere,

00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:30.040
like a wild goose stepping in the snow.

00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:32.600
Sometimes it leaves a mark,

00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:35.160
but the goose flies, ignoring where it lands.

00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:40.440
Most of the time,

00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:41.240
life is like that.

00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:42.680
Like a goose

00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:44.360
flying desperately on and on.

00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:45.320
But in the end,

00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:47.640
you don't actually know

00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:49.600
where you'll end up.

00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:51.600
By chance,

00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:53.640
you see a stretch of snow,

00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:55.320
you stop

00:35:56.440 --> 00:35:57.960
and leave a few footprints.

00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:00.800
You think this is the place,

00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:02.720
and you'll remember it

00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:04.160
and definitely return.

00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:08.200
Even if you do come back,

00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:10.000
once flown, it's gone.

00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:12.240
You can't possibly find

00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:13.200
the same place again.

00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:14.680
Because last year's snow

00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:17.560
has already melted.

00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:19.600
Right?

00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:22.680
So talented, really.

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:24.040
You're really

00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:25.600
director material.

00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:27.160
No, not really.

00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:28.480
But my

00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:29.520
award-winning film

00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:30.920
explored exactly this.

00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:32.840
But I didn't come up with this.

00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:34.840
It's by Su Shi.

00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:37.880
You haven't read it?

00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:43.920
I'm a science major.

00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:45.720
Right.

00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:47.200
Science major. Yeah.

00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:48.440
We science majors

00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:49.280
didn't study that stuff.

00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:50.120
Yeah.

00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:51.040
Why don't you

00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:52.160
show us that film of yours?

00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:55.120
I told you,

00:36:55.120 --> 00:36:56.280
you can't find it online.

00:36:56.320 --> 00:36:56.760
How can we watch it?

00:36:56.760 --> 00:36:57.480
Don't...

00:36:57.960 --> 00:36:58.840
No need to be modest.

00:36:58.840 --> 00:36:59.480
Bring it out

00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:00.840
and let's enjoy it together.

00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:05.440
I have the DVD.

00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:08.560
Do you have a DVD player?

00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:49.400
[Hi, Zhang Ran, I'm Qian Dan.]

[You can look that up.]

[I used to]

[watch your show.]

[I'm actually a fan.]

[I know]

[Are you considering]

[Dear,]

[what you've decided.]

[Your topic]

[I think we really]

[need to decide now.]

[Once this wave of attention passes,]

[Zhang Ran,]

00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:34.000
[I think I understand]

[what you're hesitant about.]

00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:35.560
Place this one.

[Actually, being a blogger]

00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:37.640
[is very similar]

00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:38.840
[to being a TV host.]

00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:40.080
[But the career prospects]

00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:40.960
[for video bloggers far surpass]

00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:42.800
[those of traditional hosts.]

00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:44.000
[With your experience,]

[plus the current buzz,]

00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:46.120
[you could definitely be]

00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:47.800
[in the spotlight again.]

00:38:57.960 --> 00:38:58.680
Are you asleep?

00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:05.320
Honey, if you

00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:06.800
could have one superpower,

00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:07.800
what would you want?

00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:11.360
When I was little,

00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:14.440
I wanted a bamboo-copter.

00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:17.480
Put it on

00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:19.160
and fly up into the sky.

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:23.440
When I was in school,

00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:27.720
I wanted memory bread.

00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:31.240
Press it

00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:34.000
against the book,

00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:37.160
and the words would stick to it. Eat it

00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:39.320
and you'd remember everything.

00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:41.160
Now,

00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:48.080
I want an Anywhere Door.

00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:51.200
Go anywhere you want.

00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:53.800
When you go shopping,

00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:55.680
just open the door

00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:57.640
and you're at the mall.

00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:00.640
The Anywhere Door sounds good.

00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:03.400
Get one for me too.

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:06.920
Where do you want to go?

00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:16.640
I want to go back to China.

00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:27.920
For what?

00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:30.960
I want to go back

00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:34.320
and be a short-video blogger.

00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:41.960
Is that your wish too?

00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:44.480
I'm serious.

00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:53.560
Then what about me?

00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:02.160
I hope you'll come back with me.

00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:14.640
It's so sudden.

00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:18.400
I can't decide.

00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:29.360
Just let me try this once.

00:41:30.720 --> 00:41:31.880
If it doesn't work out, I'll come back.

00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:35.120
You keep doing your decoration work,

00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:38.640
and I'll stay home and have babies.

00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:43.640
You have my word.

00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:48.800
I've never lied

00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:49.560
to you

00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:52.480
since the day we met, right?

00:41:56.440 --> 00:41:57.960
You've already decided, haven't you?
