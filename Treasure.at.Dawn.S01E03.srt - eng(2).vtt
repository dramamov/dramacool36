Yes.

I must have been dead.

Based on your medical skills,

you must have found

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.040
that the poison I was poisoned with is different from that of others,

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.330

If someone seeking to rule the realm gains it,

No.

That's why

which used to be clean.

00:21:13.650 --> 00:21:16.170
Commoners like us have no other water source.

00:21:16.210 --> 00:21:17.040
To survive,

00:21:17.210 --> 00:21:18.490
we had to drink water from the lake

00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:20.120
which gave us

00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:22.770
soars all over the body.

00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:25.360
Why not drill a well?

00:21:26.930 --> 00:21:28.250
We tried,

00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:29.600
only to find

00:21:29.730 --> 00:21:31.170
that the well water

00:21:31.250 --> 00:21:32.770
is also poisonous.

00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:34.930
After a while,

00:21:34.970 --> 00:21:36.520
people stopped trying.

00:21:38.410 --> 00:21:39.080
I can see

00:21:39.490 --> 00:21:40.490
that you two are young physicians

00:21:40.490 --> 00:21:41.930
with decent looks.

00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:45.250
If you don't want to be like us,

00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:46.210
don't drink

00:21:46.210 --> 00:21:47.970
from the Xiangshui Lake.

00:21:48.770 --> 00:21:49.560
Keep that in mind.

00:21:50.650 --> 00:21:51.600
Take care.

00:21:57.440 --> 00:21:58.220
Your Excellency.

00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:00.620
We've collected over half of the ores

00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:01.770
required for the Golden Bloom Banquet.

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:04.050
Yet that's not enough for the banquet.

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:06.620
Merchants are swarming into Xichuan,

00:22:07.030 --> 00:22:08.560
and we need more Star Gold.

00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:10.660
That's okay.

00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:12.180
Jiu,

00:22:12.430 --> 00:22:13.140
let me ask you something.

00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:14.620
Do you know

00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:16.380
why I got to be

00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:18.250
the lord of this city

00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:19.930
for so many years?

Your Excellency's outstanding capability.

00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:26.970
A kind heart for the people.

00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:32.580
Forgive me for my dullness. Please enlighten me.

00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:36.250
Look.

The talents in Xichuan?

00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:53.450
God's will.

[Star Gold Mine, Xichuan]

00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:33.210

I found it!

Star Gold!

00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:39.780
This is Star Gold!

00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:40.730
I haven't got

00:23:40.750 --> 00:23:41.820

I'm Liu.

Congratulations, Mr. Liu,

00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:49.450
for finding the Star Gold!

Weigh it.

00:23:55.030 --> 00:23:57.650
The ore weighs six taels and is worth a hundred taels of gold.

Congratulations, Mr. Liu.

00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:02.820
Mister, will you keep digging

00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:04.170
or go back to the city to put your feet up?

00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:06.730
I'm going back to the city for a few days

00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:08.010
and I'll be back to keep digging.

00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:09.340
All right.

Impressive!

00:25:00.030 --> 00:25:02.140
Melons have cold properties. You shouldn't have too much.

Fine.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.220
Better than nothing.

Sweet!

00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:28.730
I just hope that spoiled girl

00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:30.660
can be half as sensible as you are.

00:25:32.750 --> 00:25:33.980
After hearing about my headache,

00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:36.740
she claimed that she wanted to help me out

00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:39.050
by finding a physician to cure me.

00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:41.050
Looking back now,

00:25:41.790 --> 00:25:42.620
she was just

00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:44.770
not happy about the marriage arrangement I made for her

00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:46.290
and made up an excuse

00:25:46.310 --> 00:25:47.180
to avoid me.

00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:52.290
Her Highness has always adored you.

She was trying to get you a physician this time.

00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:58.460
I think she's refusing all the marriage arrangements

00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:01.460
because she doesn't want to leave your side.

00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:04.660
Do you think I don't know that?

00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:07.050
Her mom was taken from us too early.

00:26:07.790 --> 00:26:10.460
I brought her up myself.

00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:13.620
Our tie is deep.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.770
I don't want her to leave me either.

Let me get you a physician.

Don't bother.

Fu Sheng is a physician.

Yet you, General Xubu,

00:31:24.590 --> 00:31:27.320
drew your sword without asking.

00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:28.520
What?

00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:31.000
Is this how the Ma Gang entertains guests?

00:31:32.390 --> 00:31:34.080
This is an internal affair of the Ma Gang.

00:31:34.630 --> 00:31:36.080
Please stay out of this, Your Highness.

00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:38.630
Fangxiang died mysteriously during the performance.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:40.910
How is this Ma Gang's internal affair?

00:31:40.910 --> 00:31:43.480
Fangxiang died because his skills were not well-honed.

00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:46.320
He failed in the exorcism, and the plague devil took his life.

00:31:47.670 --> 00:31:49.320
This is not the plague devil's doing.

00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:50.910
It's a homicide.

00:31:50.910 --> 00:31:51.720
Oh, really?

Do you have evidence?

00:31:54.110 --> 00:31:55.720
The wound of the deceased is evidence.

00:31:56.150 --> 00:31:58.800
This is a wound caused by a wrist crossbow

00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:00.630
or a slingshot arrow.

00:32:01.110 --> 00:32:02.110
This kind of crossbow

00:32:02.350 --> 00:32:04.080
features short ranges and low accuracy.

00:32:04.430 --> 00:32:06.040
The shooter cannot be far from the target.

00:32:07.390 --> 00:32:08.630

by the side of the stage when Fangxiang got hurt.

00:32:13.190 --> 00:32:14.350
Did you see

00:32:14.350 --> 00:32:15.430
an arrow of some sort

00:32:15.430 --> 00:32:16.560
soared toward the stage?

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:18.800
No.

00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:20.350
That adds up.

00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:23.110
Besides, Fangxiang was surrounded

00:32:23.150 --> 00:32:24.580
by the beasts.

00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:28.000
If the arrow came from outside the stage,

00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:31.000
it would have hit a beast first.

00:32:32.430 --> 00:32:33.590
Are you saying

00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:36.630
that the killer is not one of the viewers,

00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:38.240
but

00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:39.560
one of the eight beasts?

00:32:40.150 --> 00:32:40.960
That's right.

00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:43.430
That's just his deduction.

00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:45.800
That can't prove that Fangxiang wasn't killed by the plague devil.

00:32:45.990 --> 00:32:47.680
Find the beasts, ask them questions,

00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:48.760
and we'll have the answer.

00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:49.210
Go.

00:32:49.910 --> 00:32:52.140
Arrest those beasts and bring them to me.

00:32:52.370 --> 00:32:52.890
Yes.

00:32:56.060 --> 00:32:56.650
Hurry.

00:33:02.830 --> 00:33:03.380
Boss!

00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:07.180
What is this?

00:33:07.590 --> 00:33:08.550
How come there's one missing?

00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:11.470
One of them got away at some point.

00:33:11.550 --> 00:33:13.470
He ditched the costume to escape.

00:33:16.510 --> 00:33:17.830
What do you have to say now, Xubu Huai?

00:33:19.470 --> 00:33:20.710
Consider leaving yourself

00:33:21.030 --> 00:33:22.380
with some space when speaking.

00:33:22.590 --> 00:33:23.790
What are you waiting for? Huh?

00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:28.030
Someone is on the loose! Aren't you going to chase after him?

00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:28.920
Yes!

00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:31.240
Boss...

00:33:32.510 --> 00:33:33.530
Which direction should we go?

00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:34.550
You...

00:33:34.830 --> 00:33:35.590
What a no-good!

00:33:35.670 --> 00:33:37.550
There's nothing around here. Where can he go?

00:33:39.750 --> 00:33:40.990
Ask our men to spread out.

00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:42.590
With ten miles as the range,

00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:44.030
start searching!

00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:44.720
Yes!

00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:46.030
All of you, let's go.

00:33:57.250 --> 00:33:58.760
Do you think Fangxiang

00:33:58.900 --> 00:34:01.050
was killed by that thing?

00:34:01.290 --> 00:34:02.970
The physician said

00:34:03.290 --> 00:34:04.610
that this is not the devil's doing,

00:34:05.260 --> 00:34:06.530
but a man's.

00:34:06.700 --> 00:34:07.850
I wouldn't be so sure.

00:34:07.850 --> 00:34:08.570
I observed

00:34:08.850 --> 00:34:10.330
from a short distance.

00:34:10.460 --> 00:34:12.090
If an arrow caused the death,

00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:13.420
then it should be on the site.

00:34:13.660 --> 00:34:14.770
But guess what?

00:34:15.090 --> 00:34:16.530
Fangxiang's neck

00:34:16.530 --> 00:34:17.940
is pierced through with a huge hole,

00:34:18.020 --> 00:34:18.850
yet there's nothing

00:34:18.940 --> 00:34:20.020
inside the hole.

00:34:20.370 --> 00:34:21.290
Forget about an arrow,

00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:22.610
I didn't see anything.

00:34:23.050 --> 00:34:24.460
Drilling a hole

00:34:24.570 --> 00:34:25.570
in a man's body

00:34:25.570 --> 00:34:26.660
with everyone watching,

00:34:26.850 --> 00:34:27.530
that sounds

00:34:27.850 --> 00:34:28.510
like the plague devil to me.

00:34:29.130 --> 00:34:30.260
How dare you mention that thing's name?

00:34:30.260 --> 00:34:31.660
Trying to get yourself killed?

00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:33.410
Such a whammy!

00:34:35.380 --> 00:34:37.380
What is that sound?

00:34:37.380 --> 00:34:37.770
Is that...

00:34:37.770 --> 00:34:39.290
Is the devil onto us already?

00:34:41.450 --> 00:34:42.720
You have always been the bold one.

00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:43.490
Go check it out!

00:34:43.490 --> 00:34:44.240
Why don't you go?

00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:45.170
Go! Take the torch.

00:34:45.170 --> 00:34:46.360
Yeah! Hurry up.

00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:47.050
Go!

00:35:09.450 --> 00:35:10.130
Come here!

00:35:10.570 --> 00:35:11.760
There's... There's someone here.

00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:14.840
Thank you, my lords.

00:35:14.970 --> 00:35:16.680
You are the actor of one of the beasts.

00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:19.240
What happened to you?

00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:20.010
I am

00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:22.200
the actor of one of the beasts.

00:35:22.490 --> 00:35:23.400
When the eight of us

00:35:23.610 --> 00:35:25.240
were preparing for the performance earlier,

00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:26.880
I suddenly felt the urge to pee.

00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:28.570
I went to the back of the tree

00:35:28.570 --> 00:35:29.650
to take care of my business.

00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:31.360
Suddenly,

00:35:31.930 --> 00:35:32.760
someone knocked me out

00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:33.680
and tied me up.

00:35:35.170 --> 00:35:36.400
My clothes are gone.

00:35:36.650 --> 00:35:38.010
Did you see the one who did this?

00:35:42.470 --> 00:35:43.600
Even if he didn't see anyone,

00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:45.580
his words prove a man is behind this

00:35:45.580 --> 00:35:46.830
instead of the plague devil.

00:35:48.010 --> 00:35:49.570
Loser.

00:35:50.050 --> 00:35:50.840
Go on about your business.

00:35:51.650 --> 00:35:52.240
Yes!

00:35:52.970 --> 00:35:54.680
We don't have the killer,

00:35:54.930 --> 00:35:56.570
and the murder weapon is nowhere to be found.

00:35:56.570 --> 00:35:58.970
You keep claiming that it's not the plague devil's doing,

00:36:00.010 --> 00:36:00.840
but check out the wound.

00:36:01.090 --> 00:36:02.530
There's not even an arrow inside.

00:36:02.530 --> 00:36:03.800
How could a man do that?

00:36:04.590 --> 00:36:05.470
Xubu Huai

00:36:05.910 --> 00:36:08.220
Do you have a vendetta against the Ma Gang?

00:36:08.510 --> 00:36:09.680
Hey, watch your words!

00:36:09.690 --> 00:36:11.270
If you have nothing against the Ma Gang,

00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:13.210
why insist on putting this plague devil problem

00:36:13.210 --> 00:36:15.250
on the Ma Gang?

00:36:16.130 --> 00:36:18.210
This man is doing all he can to help you prove

00:36:18.210 --> 00:36:19.780
that there's no plague devil involved here.

00:36:19.780 --> 00:36:20.900
Why do you keep getting in his way?

00:36:20.900 --> 00:36:21.670
But this guy...

00:36:21.670 --> 00:36:23.790
- I... - If you don't want the Ma Gang to be suspected,

00:36:23.790 --> 00:36:25.340
stop the yelling.

00:36:30.980 --> 00:36:31.980
I found the arrowhead.

00:36:36.090 --> 00:36:37.020
From what I can tell,

00:36:37.780 --> 00:36:39.980
Fangxiang is not killed by an ordinary arrow,

00:36:40.460 --> 00:36:41.780
but an arrow

00:36:42.370 --> 00:36:43.210
made from an animal bone.

00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:47.470
The bone is harder than human bones.

00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:51.370
This could only be

00:36:51.860 --> 00:36:54.250
the bone of a bear or a tiger.

00:36:55.300 --> 00:36:57.780
Bear bones and tiger bones are different.

00:36:58.910 --> 00:37:00.300
The pores on bear bone

00:37:00.770 --> 00:37:02.360
are larger than those on tiger bone.

00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:06.090
This piece is tough and dense.

00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:09.140
I think it's a tiger bone.

00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:50.000
