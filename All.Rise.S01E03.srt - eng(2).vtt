00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:00.040
Leaving?

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.100
Are we really going to review

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:21.940
all of this again?

00:02:22.419 --> 00:02:24.459
There are so many pages, all in English.

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.260
Not planning to sleep tonight?

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:27.299
It's fine.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.100
You should head back. It's late.

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:33.540
No need. I'm staying.

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.739
I'll help you

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.260
review as much as we can manage.

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:39.100
Guo Xiaoyu,

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:41.060
let me tell you again.

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:43.299
I don't blame you for that video.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:44.100
Staying awake

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.820
and hovering here won't solve anything.

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:47.899
We already submitted the translation.

00:02:48.179 --> 00:02:49.220
Your presence here

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:50.780
doesn't seem necessary.

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:51.859
It only moves you.

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:59.579
I understand.

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.859
I guess I really can't help much here.

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:07.340
I'll go back.

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:09.459
Go, guys.

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:45.500
Still holding up?

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:48.899
Relax.

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:51.739
I'll outlast you even if you collapse.

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:56.019
Why take this risk with me?

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:59.459
Fine with loss?

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:01.419
This isn't about you.

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.579
It's my professional judgment.

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:10.060
Careful, don't burn out.

00:04:10.899 --> 00:04:11.820
Speak up if you can't.

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:16.660
I'm back again.

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:20.140
I can't help with document review,

00:04:20.379 --> 00:04:21.020
so

00:04:21.179 --> 00:04:22.780
I got you snacks and coffee.

00:04:22.819 --> 00:04:23.780
Take what you like.

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:27.859
Not sure about your preferences.

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:29.220
Here's coffee.

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:30.619
Hot one for you. It's scalding.

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.619
Here.

00:04:32.739 --> 00:04:33.179
Thanks.

00:04:34.059 --> 00:04:34.739
Don't mention it.

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:35.980
To be clear,

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:37.419
this is my treat.

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:38.819
No transferring money to me.

00:04:39.299 --> 00:04:41.460
I'll come early
tomorrow to cover for you.

00:04:41.619 --> 00:04:43.499
Grab some shut-eye before returning.

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:46.340
My mom says sleep is non-negotiable.

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.460
Skipping sleep makes you dumb, got it?

00:04:51.619 --> 00:04:52.059
Leaving.

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:53.419
Go, go!

00:04:53.619 --> 00:04:54.059
Thanks.

00:04:54.059 --> 00:04:54.819
It's okay. Bye.

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:40.780
I found it.

00:06:41.619 --> 00:06:42.340
Jiang Chen, look.

00:06:42.819 --> 00:06:43.819
They made a mistake here.

00:06:45.419 --> 00:06:46.020
Perfect.

00:06:46.819 --> 00:06:47.939
I'll email Mr. Song now.

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:17.020
Why did you suddenly back me yesterday?

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:20.140
Because you said

00:07:20.819 --> 00:07:22.900
James is a law firm too.

00:07:23.379 --> 00:07:24.220
We're all human.

00:07:24.419 --> 00:07:25.419
Humans make mistakes.

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:29.780
Remember

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:31.739
what Mr. Song emphasized
during the briefing?

00:07:34.419 --> 00:07:36.220
He specifically stated

00:07:36.819 --> 00:07:38.140
that we and James Law Firm

00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:40.660
must verify the deal under both domestic

00:07:40.739 --> 00:07:42.020
and international law.

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:43.499
If Mr. Song

00:07:43.499 --> 00:07:45.100
only wanted a translation,

00:07:45.419 --> 00:07:45.980
why explain it

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:47.900
in such detail

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:50.259
and specify

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:52.739
Jun An must conduct
legal verification too?

00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:56.859
You also suspect this test

00:07:56.859 --> 00:07:58.259
isn't just about translation?

00:08:04.739 --> 00:08:06.140
Worried about the Warm Nest matter?

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:10.980
They will announce

00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:12.419
their decision on me this morning.

00:08:14.179 --> 00:08:15.419
You didn't actually do wrong.

00:08:16.179 --> 00:08:17.179
You said "Jun An".

00:08:17.179 --> 00:08:18.819
You didn't say you were their lawyer.

00:08:19.379 --> 00:08:20.220
If I were you,

00:08:20.299 --> 00:08:22.619
I'd go straight to Mr. Zhuang at dawn

00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:23.580
to appeal my case.

00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:27.179
What's this?

00:08:27.939 --> 00:08:29.580
Friendly advice from a rival?

00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:33.539
Call it a defense opinion

00:08:33.859 --> 00:08:35.739
from the great lawyer from the future

00:08:35.739 --> 00:08:37.139
on this case.

00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:44.899
We've known each other
for quite some time.

00:08:45.739 --> 00:08:47.060
You've never smiled like this.

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:54.980
I'll go this way.

00:08:56.659 --> 00:08:57.220
Going that way

00:08:57.499 --> 00:08:58.259
for the subway.

00:08:59.139 --> 00:09:00.420
Trying to make it home.

00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:01.580
Shower and change clothes.

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:02.779
Dawn's breaking.

00:09:02.779 --> 00:09:03.899
Should I walk you home?

00:09:04.619 --> 00:09:05.739
Don't worry. Thanks.

00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:16.820
Ren Jiatong.

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:21.859
If we don't fight for our own rights

00:09:21.859 --> 00:09:23.379
and work hard to claim them,

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:25.300
then why are we even lawyers?

00:09:26.499 --> 00:09:27.220
Your world

00:09:27.259 --> 00:09:28.899
shouldn't only have clients and cases.

00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:30.980
Include yourself in it.

00:09:32.619 --> 00:09:33.820
Fight for yourself.

00:09:58.980 --> 00:09:59.619
Good morning.

00:09:59.700 --> 00:09:59.980
Morning.

00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:01.779
Good morning.

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:03.340
Lucy, the new receptionist.

00:10:03.899 --> 00:10:05.019
This is the coffee for you.

00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:06.940
Thank you.

00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:18.340
Come in.

00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:23.700
Hello, Ms. Bai.

00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:26.300
I'm a candidate
in the Talent Hunt Program.

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:26.859
Ren Jiatong.

00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:28.019
In the group chat,

00:10:28.019 --> 00:10:29.340
I responded to you.

00:10:29.619 --> 00:10:30.499
Here's what I compiled

00:10:30.499 --> 00:10:32.980
about the medical dispute case.

00:10:33.259 --> 00:10:35.139
The digital version
is already in your email.

00:10:35.139 --> 00:10:36.259
Hope this helps.

00:10:38.779 --> 00:10:39.340
Your name?

00:10:39.859 --> 00:10:40.499
Ren Jiatong.

00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:45.180
In that Warm Nest video,

00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:46.899
you're the one
who caused trouble for us.

00:10:49.019 --> 00:10:51.420
So you came to pull strings
through connections?

00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:55.580
I just wanted

00:10:55.739 --> 00:10:57.379
to demonstrate my work capabilities.

00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:00.940
Regarding your retention,

00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:02.539
Mr. Zhuang asked for my opinion.

00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:05.659
Give me a reason you should stay.

00:11:09.539 --> 00:11:11.019
I'll work to the best of my ability.

00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:12.980
Or do your best to make mistakes?

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.280
(Analyze? What responsibility?)

00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:24.968
(What obligation? What relationship?)

00:11:24.968 --> 00:11:27.368
(Format?)

00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:55.619
It's all my fault.

00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:57.220
Let me go explain to them.

00:11:57.820 --> 00:11:58.899
You can't explain anything.

00:11:59.139 --> 00:12:00.580
You have so few followers.

00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:02.820
How did those marketing accounts
find the video?

00:12:02.899 --> 00:12:04.659
It's probably someone internal.

00:12:19.139 --> 00:12:19.659
Mr. Liu.

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:20.259
Speak.

00:12:23.539 --> 00:12:23.980
Sorry.

00:12:26.499 --> 00:12:26.859
Yes.

00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:29.859
Ms. Bai is back from her trip.

00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:31.619
She'll attend Friday's meeting.

00:12:32.899 --> 00:12:33.259
Alright.

00:12:34.019 --> 00:12:34.499
See you Friday.

00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:38.220
(Employee's Form, Ren Jiatong)
Mr. Liu came

00:12:38.499 --> 00:12:39.859
demanding answers again.

00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:40.899
Speak up.

00:12:43.499 --> 00:12:44.100
Warm Nest

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:45.980
is a major client
we need to actively pursue.

00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:47.859
Previously, Mr. Liu and I spoke,

00:12:48.139 --> 00:12:48.980
and he wanted us

00:12:49.139 --> 00:12:50.420
to eliminate Ren Jiatong.

00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:52.100
In principle,

00:12:52.619 --> 00:12:53.940
client interests should be

00:12:54.139 --> 00:12:55.460
our top priority.

00:12:56.139 --> 00:12:57.940
But ultimately, resolving this

00:12:58.220 --> 00:12:59.499
is our internal decision.

00:13:00.779 --> 00:13:02.619
How is she performing in the program?

00:13:02.659 --> 00:13:03.100
Tell me.

00:13:04.899 --> 00:13:06.739
Her assessment results
are excellent so far.

00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:08.619
She's an exceptional talent.

00:13:09.379 --> 00:13:10.420
Personally,

00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:11.779
I really like her.

00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:13.180
But her impersonation

00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:14.659
of our lawyers

00:13:14.659 --> 00:13:16.580
caused severe damage to our reputation.

00:13:17.659 --> 00:13:18.659
I saw that video.

00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:20.739
She said she was from Jun An

00:13:20.739 --> 00:13:22.100
but didn't claim to be our lawyer.

00:13:22.659 --> 00:13:23.460
Not a violation.

00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:24.899
She...

00:13:32.659 --> 00:13:33.259
Let's do this.

00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:34.619
We'll flip a coin.

00:13:34.779 --> 00:13:36.100
Whoever gets lucky decides.

00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:38.139
I agree.

00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:41.739
Seriously?

00:13:43.619 --> 00:13:44.259
Flipping a coin?

00:13:56.820 --> 00:13:57.300
Ma'am.

00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:00.739
I filmed that Warm Nest video.

00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:02.220
I uploaded it online.

00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:03.180
Not Ren Jiatong's fault.

00:14:05.139 --> 00:14:05.700
I think

00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:08.659
if Jun An eliminates a candidate

00:14:08.659 --> 00:14:09.899
just based on a single video,

00:14:11.019 --> 00:14:12.100
that would be unfair.

00:14:13.859 --> 00:14:14.859
Who told you

00:14:14.859 --> 00:14:16.379
that we plan to eliminate Ren Jiatong?

00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:22.259
Mr. Zhuang said

00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:23.940
Ms. Bai will communicate

00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:25.340
with the client for you.

00:14:25.619 --> 00:14:27.619
So you'll temporarily
remain in the program.

00:14:27.899 --> 00:14:28.940
As for your standing,

00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:31.139
we'll decide after the next assessment.

00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:34.619
Thank you.

00:14:38.899 --> 00:14:39.899
That's good!

00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:41.300
That's good!

00:14:42.139 --> 00:14:43.499
Good! You get to stay!

00:14:46.259 --> 00:14:47.220
Hug me.

00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:50.019
Alright, alright.

00:14:50.019 --> 00:14:50.899
Stop crying now.

00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:52.300
I'm still on probation.

00:14:52.859 --> 00:14:53.820
Let's both work harder.

00:15:09.259 --> 00:15:09.659
Come in.

00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:13.420
Ms. Bai.

00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:16.420
Here's your latte.

00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:17.259
18g beans extracted

00:15:17.259 --> 00:15:18.460
into 25ml espresso,

00:15:18.539 --> 00:15:20.940
topped with 180ml whole milk foam,

00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:22.379
rested for three minutes.

00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:23.779
Perfect temperature now.

00:15:24.899 --> 00:15:26.619
You've quickly figured out
my preferences.

00:15:29.899 --> 00:15:31.499
But you didn't come here to make coffee.

00:15:31.779 --> 00:15:32.820
I don't support

00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:34.460
newcomers developing such habits.

00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:37.940
I took the liberty of making this

00:15:38.019 --> 00:15:39.340
just to express my gratitude.

00:15:39.779 --> 00:15:40.980
How did you determine

00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:42.379
my taste preferences?

00:15:43.139 --> 00:15:45.060
Duoduo left notes on the fridge.

00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:47.259
Observation and gathering information

00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:48.739
are fundamental for lawyers.

00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:49.859
Lawyer?

00:15:50.899 --> 00:15:52.180
Are you sure you'll get to stay?

00:15:52.779 --> 00:15:53.420
I'm not certain,

00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:55.820
but I believe in my capabilities

00:15:56.739 --> 00:15:58.259
and your judgment, Ms. Bai.

00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:00.619
You think I favor you?

00:16:01.499 --> 00:16:02.899
You're still provisional.

00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:06.139
Truthfully, I don't care
who stays or leaves.

00:16:07.019 --> 00:16:07.820
But so far,

00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:08.980
you've been doing alright.

00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:12.659
I'm confident I won't disappoint you.

00:16:13.259 --> 00:16:15.539
This document
incorporates your revisions.

00:16:17.019 --> 00:16:17.980
Don't be overconfident.

00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:18.700
Many newcomers

00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:20.340
have made similar claims before.

00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:22.180
Prove you can last first.

00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:24.379
But I can see

00:16:24.379 --> 00:16:26.180
you do have more practical experience

00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:27.539
than other candidates.

00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:29.379
But that's all.

00:16:30.859 --> 00:16:32.779
Then I'll change your mind soon.

00:16:33.859 --> 00:16:34.300
Is that so?

00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:37.300
Book the meeting room

00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:38.499
for a meeting in 15 minutes.

00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:39.859
No problem.

00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:46.060
Mr. Song.

00:16:48.259 --> 00:16:48.700
Go ahead.

00:16:56.779 --> 00:16:57.139
Enter.

00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:02.580
Just be direct.

00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:04.940
Don't pretend it's about her competence.

00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:06.980
Who buys this excuse?

00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:10.579
This coffee still misses the mark.

00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:13.620
You talk tough

00:17:13.620 --> 00:17:14.980
but act soft.

00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:17.099
You're a renowned lawyer.

00:17:17.099 --> 00:17:18.140
Must you constantly

00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:19.620
use internet slang?

00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:21.739
Focus on legal terminology

00:17:21.779 --> 00:17:23.019
and secure more clients

00:17:23.059 --> 00:17:24.539
to sustain our department.

00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:26.180
I'm exhausted.

00:17:27.099 --> 00:17:27.579
Fine then.

00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:29.539
Let's have a proper lunch together.

00:17:29.739 --> 00:17:30.019
Agreed?

00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:30.779
No need.

00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:32.460
I have a meeting shortly.

00:17:33.779 --> 00:17:35.339
But you need to eat.

00:17:36.019 --> 00:17:36.499
Let me pack

00:17:36.499 --> 00:17:37.180
food for you.

00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:38.059
Are you free tonight?

00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:41.259
I have dinner plans with Niuniu.

00:17:41.539 --> 00:17:42.019
Another day.

00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:43.220
Another day again?

00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:45.819
Give me a concrete date.

00:17:46.579 --> 00:17:47.180
Your treat.

00:17:47.539 --> 00:17:48.380
I'll pay. Deal?

00:17:49.019 --> 00:17:49.380
Deal.

00:17:51.499 --> 00:17:51.940
Sometime.

00:18:09.019 --> 00:18:10.299
(Huang Yue)
(I'm jealous.)

00:18:10.579 --> 00:18:11.380
(But she stayed.)

00:18:11.579 --> 00:18:12.620
(I felt relieved.)

00:18:12.739 --> 00:18:13.819
(My older guy)
(Naive.)

00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:16.220
(For adults, it's just
wins and interests.)

00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:17.140
(Huang Yue)
(Yeah?)

00:18:17.539 --> 00:18:18.499
(Then between us,)

00:18:18.499 --> 00:18:19.460
(who wins?)

00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:20.940
(My older guy)
(Not over yet?)

00:18:21.499 --> 00:18:21.860
(Right.)

00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:23.579
(That bag you said you liked.)

00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:24.579
(Let's go buy it.)

00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:25.579
(Huang Yue)
(No.)

00:18:25.779 --> 00:18:27.739
(What I'm interested in now is winning.)

00:18:31.819 --> 00:18:32.460
That's great.

00:18:33.779 --> 00:18:34.380
That's great.

00:18:42.779 --> 00:18:43.660
I expected

00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:45.259
to have one less competitor.

00:18:46.059 --> 00:18:47.059
But now,

00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:48.539
she jumped ahead.

00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:51.299
Both Mr. Zhuang
and Ms. Bai supported her.

00:18:51.656 --> 00:18:53.339
Mr. Zhuang considered
the bigger picture,

00:18:53.339 --> 00:18:54.220
preserving

00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:55.620
the firm's inclusive culture

00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:57.299
and protecting the program.

00:18:57.660 --> 00:18:58.299
As for Ms. Bai,

00:18:58.579 --> 00:18:59.380
I'm not so sure.

00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:03.860
Do you think
Ren Jiatong has connections?

00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:06.180
I heard she couldn't even

00:19:06.779 --> 00:19:08.180
pass the probation assessment

00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:09.539
at Yingtai Law Firm before.

00:19:10.539 --> 00:19:12.099
But now at our place,

00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:15.019
they're cherishing a castoff.

00:19:20.739 --> 00:19:22.700
Stop talking
about Ren Jiatong like that.

00:19:24.259 --> 00:19:25.579
She's genuinely competent.

00:19:25.579 --> 00:19:26.779
That's obvious to everyone.

00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:27.900
Why can't they keep her?

00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:33.019
Besides, we're all here by fate,

00:19:33.019 --> 00:19:33.940
working together,

00:19:34.339 --> 00:19:35.620
so we should be friends.

00:19:36.059 --> 00:19:36.660
Friends?

00:19:37.579 --> 00:19:38.539
If I recall correctly,

00:19:38.620 --> 00:19:40.339
you filmed that video of Ren Jiatong.

00:19:41.739 --> 00:19:43.140
I... I didn't...

00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:43.860
Wait.

00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:46.980
What's impressive
about picking on a girl?

00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:48.900
If you want to win,
rely on your own skills.

00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:06.460
Yan Fei,

00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:09.579
thanks for earlier.

00:20:11.579 --> 00:20:12.779
I'm a coward.

00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:15.980
My mom always says
I seem quick-witted normally,

00:20:16.299 --> 00:20:18.420
but my brain freezes at crucial moments.

00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:19.499
When I look back,

00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:20.779
no,

00:20:20.779 --> 00:20:22.620
I should've said this.

00:20:23.099 --> 00:20:23.940
Brilliant comebacks

00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:24.860
stack up.

00:20:25.339 --> 00:20:26.539
But when the moment arrives,

00:20:26.579 --> 00:20:28.099
I just can't articulate it.

00:20:28.739 --> 00:20:29.460
I noticed.

00:20:29.819 --> 00:20:32.259
You played the nice guy helping
Huang Yue translate, right?

00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:33.299
How do you know?

00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:35.579
I could tell from both your expressions.

00:20:35.579 --> 00:20:36.339
I'm not blind.

00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:38.539
You think this is still school?

00:20:38.539 --> 00:20:40.019
Passing notes to your desk neighbor?

00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:41.579
Do you even want to stay here?

00:20:44.059 --> 00:20:45.819
My boyfriend kept discouraging me,

00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:48.259
saying I wouldn't last
three days in Beijing.

00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:50.059
I've survived so far,

00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:51.299
but on my first day,

00:20:51.299 --> 00:20:52.779
that Warm Nest matter occurred.

00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:55.579
I still haven't had time
to find a place to live.

00:20:56.099 --> 00:20:57.579
Staying in a budget hotel every day.

00:20:57.940 --> 00:20:59.339
My deposit hasn't been refunded,

00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:01.339
and that hotel costs hundreds daily.

00:21:01.539 --> 00:21:03.180
Swiping my credit card is killing me.

00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:05.779
As for my family,

00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:06.940
we're doing okay.

00:21:07.099 --> 00:21:09.420
Though my parents pretend to support me,

00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:10.339
deep down,

00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:12.380
they never want me to work in Beijing.

00:21:12.779 --> 00:21:13.860
So I haven't told them

00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:14.980
about this thing.

00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:16.539
Afraid they'd seize the opportunity

00:21:16.539 --> 00:21:16.940
to say,

00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:18.339
"Just come home."

00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:20.779
And your family?

00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:23.700
Mine...

00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:25.980
Just regular business people.

00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:28.339
Okay.

00:21:29.059 --> 00:21:29.819
Let's work hard

00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:30.700
and get to stay.

00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:31.900
After payday at month-end,

00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:33.299
we won't need their money.

00:21:35.779 --> 00:21:37.059
Didn't you ask Ren Jiatong?

00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:38.860
You both faced the same situation.

00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:39.779
How did she handle it?

00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:40.790
I did.

00:21:40.790 --> 00:21:42.259
She just said

00:21:42.259 --> 00:21:43.739
she found the landlord on the spot.

00:21:44.059 --> 00:21:44.900
She said to pay more.

00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:46.019
And they agreed

00:21:46.019 --> 00:21:47.739
to keep renting the apartment to her.

00:21:48.019 --> 00:21:50.099
Aren't you going
to contact the landlord?

00:21:51.259 --> 00:21:51.900
I...

00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:56.339
I feel like I probably won't

00:21:56.579 --> 00:21:57.660
even last a month here.

00:21:59.140 --> 00:22:01.140
All of you are way too impressive.

00:22:02.019 --> 00:22:02.779
I used to think

00:22:03.539 --> 00:22:04.499
back in my hometown,

00:22:04.499 --> 00:22:06.259
I'd at least stand out as exceptional.

00:22:07.059 --> 00:22:08.460
But after coming to Jun An,

00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:10.660
I'm just a nobody.

00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:13.900
Why do you think Jun An

00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:15.579
hired someone like you?

00:22:16.499 --> 00:22:17.539
Among our group,

00:22:17.539 --> 00:22:18.620
you're the youngest.

00:22:18.860 --> 00:22:20.259
No overseas education,

00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:21.819
not from top law schools,

00:22:22.579 --> 00:22:23.860
average family background,

00:22:24.019 --> 00:22:25.620
no social media influence.

00:22:26.180 --> 00:22:27.099
Why'd they pick you?

00:22:30.299 --> 00:22:31.579
Last time, you ranked higher

00:22:31.579 --> 00:22:32.980
than us from foreign universities

00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:34.779
and top Chinese law universities.

00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:37.779
So you're saying
Mr. Song and others are blind,

00:22:37.819 --> 00:22:40.059
or that we're just mediocre?

00:22:42.499 --> 00:22:43.700
Master Yan,

00:22:44.339 --> 00:22:46.099
you minored in psychology, right?

00:22:47.299 --> 00:22:48.900
I must film an ad for you someday

00:22:49.539 --> 00:22:50.940
with the tagline,

00:22:51.339 --> 00:22:54.259
"Cure workplace blues in one move,"

00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:56.779
"consult Master Yan from Jun An."

00:22:57.860 --> 00:22:59.700
Your boyfriend hit the jackpot.

00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:00.739
Dating you means getting

00:23:00.739 --> 00:23:02.059
a free psychological counselor.

00:23:03.019 --> 00:23:03.700
I'm single.

00:23:05.779 --> 00:23:06.660
You're single?

00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:09.900
How come such
a smart, pretty woman is still single?

00:23:10.779 --> 00:23:12.739
Are all those guys blind or what?

00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:14.420
Then again,

00:23:14.819 --> 00:23:16.380
someone as clever and gorgeous as you

00:23:16.779 --> 00:23:18.539
must have sky-high standards for men.

00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:20.980
I have just one criterion.

00:23:22.299 --> 00:23:23.499
No male lawyer.

00:23:26.299 --> 00:23:27.059
Meaning?

00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:28.739
Bad past experience?

00:23:30.059 --> 00:23:30.819
How do I put it?

00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:32.420
Male lawyers

00:23:33.579 --> 00:23:34.579
are too calculating.

00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:39.900
IYKYK.

00:23:41.339 --> 00:23:41.900
Meaning?

00:23:43.499 --> 00:23:44.499
If you know, you know.

00:23:51.739 --> 00:23:52.299
Excuse me.

00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:14.460
What's wrong?

00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:22.940
Not bad.

00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:24.460
Already befriending

00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:26.779
the heiress of Xingke Group?

00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:29.299
What's Xingke?

00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:30.579
Xingke Group,

00:24:30.819 --> 00:24:32.059
a private enterprise star

00:24:32.059 --> 00:24:33.499
that rose from the 90s Zhongguancun.

00:24:33.499 --> 00:24:34.460
Don't play dumb.

00:24:38.380 --> 00:24:39.860
The former chairman was surnamed Yan.

00:24:40.259 --> 00:24:41.059
The current CEO

00:24:41.059 --> 00:24:43.299
is the chairman's biological son,
Yan Da.

00:24:43.739 --> 00:24:44.860
He has a sister

00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:46.019
named Yan Fei.

00:24:46.499 --> 00:24:47.819
Rumored to go abroad years ago.

00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:49.819
If I'm right,

00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:51.660
your new friend

00:24:52.059 --> 00:24:54.380
is the precious daughter
of Xingke Group's boss.

00:24:56.499 --> 00:24:57.860
Must be nice having family wealth.

00:24:58.620 --> 00:25:00.779
No need to kill yourself competing

00:25:01.180 --> 00:25:02.739
for a single job offer like us.

00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:05.180
See the bag she carried days ago?

00:25:06.099 --> 00:25:07.660
It costs about 100 times more

00:25:07.739 --> 00:25:08.860
than both our bags combined.

00:25:10.779 --> 00:25:11.539
Being her friend

00:25:11.539 --> 00:25:12.579
shows you're no fool.

00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:14.980
Maybe she'll get you hired too

00:25:15.299 --> 00:25:15.940
if she's happy.

00:25:16.499 --> 00:25:17.779
Nonsense. I didn't.

00:25:17.779 --> 00:25:19.099
I had no idea who she was.

00:25:30.259 --> 00:25:30.819
What's it?

00:25:30.819 --> 00:25:31.460
I'm working.

00:25:31.739 --> 00:25:32.739
Keep Saturday noon free.

00:25:33.259 --> 00:25:34.099
To meet someone.

00:25:35.019 --> 00:25:35.620
I'm busy.

00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:38.259
Didn't you say last night

00:25:38.339 --> 00:25:39.579
some people at your firm

00:25:39.579 --> 00:25:40.779
started assisting the seniors?

00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:42.099
You shouldn't fall behind.

00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:44.579
Cut the crap. Get to the point.

00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:48.620
If you bring in clients,

00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:50.380
they will fight to mentor you.

00:25:52.779 --> 00:25:53.900
Saturday noon works.

00:25:54.099 --> 00:25:54.940
Send me the address.

00:25:57.140 --> 00:25:57.620
1:30 PM.

00:25:57.620 --> 00:25:58.779
Back to work. Bye.

00:25:59.620 --> 00:25:59.980
Bye.

00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:12.339
What's going on?

00:26:12.339 --> 00:26:13.019
Where are they?

00:26:15.819 --> 00:26:17.900
Mr. Zhou told us to go
to the conference room.

00:26:18.339 --> 00:26:19.220
They've already gone.

00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:36.019
Seems you guys stayed up late last night

00:26:36.099 --> 00:26:37.019
for the translations.

00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:39.380
The translations were good.

00:26:40.299 --> 00:26:41.460
Ren Jiatong, Jiang Chen,

00:26:42.059 --> 00:26:43.099
I received your email.

00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:43.900
Well done.

00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:48.019
Now, I'd like to ask everyone.

00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:49.380
What do you think

00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:51.059
is the objective of this round

00:26:51.299 --> 00:26:51.940
of assessment?

00:26:52.940 --> 00:26:54.220
Isn't it legal English?

00:26:56.499 --> 00:26:58.339
Those who want to be lawyers,
raise your hand.

00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:06.019
Good.

00:27:06.819 --> 00:27:07.700
Everyone here,

00:27:07.819 --> 00:27:08.900
you stood out among many

00:27:08.980 --> 00:27:10.220
to enter our program.

00:27:11.019 --> 00:27:12.620
If we only gave you a translation test,

00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:14.860
it would underestimate all of you.

00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:21.099
You know the document has an issue.

00:27:22.579 --> 00:27:22.980
Right.

00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:24.620
This assessment

00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:26.220
is actually based on

00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:27.940
the real case-handling experience

00:27:27.940 --> 00:27:28.739
of Mr. Song.

00:27:29.380 --> 00:27:31.339
When he received
this document back then,

00:27:31.499 --> 00:27:32.980
he quickly discovered the flaw.

00:27:33.499 --> 00:27:34.579
At once, he communicated

00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:35.660
with the client

00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:37.700
and the opposing law firm
about the issue

00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:39.620
and asked for the original document.

00:27:39.940 --> 00:27:40.380
Of course,

00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:42.860
the final result left
the client very satisfied.

00:27:43.339 --> 00:27:44.620
They renewed their agreement

00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:47.059
with Jun An the following year.

00:27:47.539 --> 00:27:49.099
After acquiring Kern Company,

00:27:49.420 --> 00:27:50.140
they hired Jun An

00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:52.299
to handle the legal advisory work

00:27:52.299 --> 00:27:54.499
for Kern Company's projects
in mainland China.

00:27:56.900 --> 00:27:59.180
So Mr. Song, you set this task

00:27:59.739 --> 00:28:00.700
to test whether we are

00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:02.779
just doing translation work by rote

00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:04.900
or thinking like a professional lawyer.

00:28:05.579 --> 00:28:05.980
Exactly.

00:28:09.019 --> 00:28:10.019
Impressive.

00:28:10.779 --> 00:28:12.099
I'd like to ask a question.

00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:14.339
Last night, while you were

00:28:14.819 --> 00:28:16.940
busy translating
these original documents,

00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:17.940
did anyone think

00:28:18.259 --> 00:28:19.059
to come and discuss

00:28:19.579 --> 00:28:21.220
with me or Mr. Zhou?

00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:22.779
Did you?

00:28:27.339 --> 00:28:28.579
We mainly just

00:28:29.019 --> 00:28:31.019
didn't want to disturb
you or Mr. Zhou's rest.

00:28:31.539 --> 00:28:32.019
Mr. Song.

00:28:32.499 --> 00:28:33.539
- It's...
- It's my fault.

00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:38.499
Checking the original files was right.

00:28:40.499 --> 00:28:42.019
Considering the client is good.

00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:43.940
But you have forgotten

00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:44.779
the crucial point,

00:28:46.259 --> 00:28:47.860
which is feedback and communication.

00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:49.660
Since the duty of this case

00:28:49.819 --> 00:28:51.140
lies with your supervisor,

00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:53.339
all decisions regarding the case

00:28:53.579 --> 00:28:54.700
should be made by him.

00:28:55.660 --> 00:28:57.220
It's rights matching responsibilities.

00:28:57.900 --> 00:28:59.180
You're all law school graduates,

00:28:59.180 --> 00:28:59.660
so you know

00:29:00.259 --> 00:29:01.140
this point.

00:29:04.499 --> 00:29:05.980
At the time, we just wanted

00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:07.819
to resolve the issue ourselves.

00:29:08.019 --> 00:29:09.259
But did you consider

00:29:09.739 --> 00:29:10.940
whether the judgment you made

00:29:11.019 --> 00:29:12.099
was necessarily correct?

00:29:13.259 --> 00:29:14.259
You're all new to this

00:29:14.779 --> 00:29:15.779
without much experience.

00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:19.259
There's a risk of error
in your judgments.

00:29:20.819 --> 00:29:22.019
So the safest way

00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:23.019
was to report

00:29:23.779 --> 00:29:24.220
this matter

00:29:24.819 --> 00:29:25.819
to me and Mr. Zhou.

00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:28.220
Then we could
communicate with the client

00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:30.579
to get the original files for review.

00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:34.620
Unfortunately,

00:29:35.579 --> 00:29:36.579
I waited all night.

00:29:38.380 --> 00:29:39.220
Not a single person

00:29:39.499 --> 00:29:40.339
texted me

00:29:40.980 --> 00:29:41.860
to discuss this.

00:29:43.339 --> 00:29:44.539
From what you just said,

00:29:45.019 --> 00:29:47.259
there are even issues
with your internal communication.

00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:48.579
And this is

00:29:49.259 --> 00:29:51.539
precisely the core content and objective

00:29:51.980 --> 00:29:52.700
of this round.

00:29:55.620 --> 00:29:56.140
Sorry.

00:29:56.900 --> 00:29:57.700
For this round,

00:29:58.980 --> 00:29:59.700
everyone is zero.

00:30:09.819 --> 00:30:11.499
No changes
to the current round of scores.

00:30:12.059 --> 00:30:12.980
Also, a reminder.

00:30:13.099 --> 00:30:15.420
The first round of the program
will conclude shortly.

00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:16.860
Push yourselves harder.

00:30:21.736 --> 00:30:22.536
(Talent Hunt Program Scoreboard
Second Assessment of the First Round)

00:30:22.536 --> 00:30:24.360
(Jiang Chen 30, Ren Jiatong 30,
Guo Xiaoyu 20, Wang Lu 10)

00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:26.248
(Yan Fei 0, Li Ke 0, Huang Yue 0)

00:30:26.739 --> 00:30:29.220
After work, go home and get rest.

00:30:29.779 --> 00:30:30.739
Think about

00:30:31.499 --> 00:30:32.299
your weekend plans.

00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:34.140
Life isn't all about work.

00:30:35.779 --> 00:30:37.059
There is much other fun.

00:30:38.940 --> 00:30:40.259
Jun An is a law firm,

00:30:40.299 --> 00:30:41.140
not a sweatshop.

00:30:41.779 --> 00:30:42.860
The work will end,

00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:44.900
nor should you handle it all alone.

00:30:47.620 --> 00:30:47.940
Come in.

00:30:49.299 --> 00:30:49.660
Mr. Song.

00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:50.779
Have a seat.

00:30:55.700 --> 00:30:57.140
Mr. Song, I'll go out.

00:30:57.660 --> 00:30:58.739
About the pending matter,

00:30:59.779 --> 00:31:00.380
don't stress.

00:31:00.779 --> 00:31:01.739
You didn't perform well,

00:31:02.180 --> 00:31:03.019
but try again later.

00:31:04.180 --> 00:31:05.019
Admit your fatigue.

00:31:05.180 --> 00:31:05.940
Ask for help.

00:31:06.460 --> 00:31:07.499
Work-life balance.

00:31:08.579 --> 00:31:10.259
Don't abuse your youth
with overexertion.

00:31:11.180 --> 00:31:11.620
Remember?

00:31:14.259 --> 00:31:14.980
Give it to me.

00:31:25.620 --> 00:31:26.099
Drink tea?

00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:26.980
Alright.

00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:28.460
My tea is decent.

00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:31.299
It won't keep you awake at night.

00:31:32.539 --> 00:31:33.140
Here, try it.

00:31:33.620 --> 00:31:34.180
Thank you.

00:31:38.140 --> 00:31:40.339
I'd like to discuss my last assessment.

00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:43.940
Actually, when I was
studying abroad, I realized

00:31:44.299 --> 00:31:46.220
China had moved fast
over the past two decades.

00:31:46.579 --> 00:31:47.779
Especially in legal services.

00:31:48.339 --> 00:31:49.980
It's moved beyond the small-scale firms

00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:51.739
from my father's generation.

00:31:52.059 --> 00:31:53.940
Red Circle Firms like Jun An

00:31:54.339 --> 00:31:55.420
are now steadily moving

00:31:55.460 --> 00:31:56.620
and surpassing foreign firms.

00:31:57.420 --> 00:31:58.380
I think your success

00:31:58.620 --> 00:31:59.339
in "killing" James

00:31:59.339 --> 00:32:00.660
and securing the client

00:32:00.980 --> 00:32:02.099
is the best proof.

00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:04.339
I didn't kill anyone.

00:32:04.739 --> 00:32:05.539
You make me nervous.

00:32:06.059 --> 00:32:06.980
I might need a lawyer.

00:32:09.140 --> 00:32:09.900
All along,

00:32:10.059 --> 00:32:11.620
no matter how much my dad opposes me,

00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:13.739
I've had only one goal,

00:32:14.180 --> 00:32:15.460
to become an excellent lawyer.

00:32:16.819 --> 00:32:18.259
That's why I want to take on

00:32:18.579 --> 00:32:20.259
more challenging cases like Ren Jiatong.

00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:24.339
Mr. Song,

00:32:26.140 --> 00:32:27.539
I really want to work with you.

00:32:31.259 --> 00:32:32.059
You mentioned

00:32:32.620 --> 00:32:33.539
your dad was a lawyer?

00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:36.460
He...

00:32:37.539 --> 00:32:39.059
He's a local lawyer in our hometown.

00:32:41.299 --> 00:32:42.579
I appreciate and admire

00:32:43.460 --> 00:32:44.099
your confidence.

00:32:45.499 --> 00:32:46.380
Ren earned her tasks

00:32:46.380 --> 00:32:47.539
by negotiating with Ms. Bai.

00:32:48.420 --> 00:32:49.499
You could try.

00:32:51.380 --> 00:32:52.620
I'll be posting upcoming tasks

00:32:52.620 --> 00:32:53.499
in the group chat,

00:32:54.980 --> 00:32:55.579
but

00:32:56.380 --> 00:32:57.259
here's a suggestion.

00:32:58.380 --> 00:32:59.099
From what I know,

00:32:59.819 --> 00:33:01.259
Ren Jiatong is currently

00:33:01.259 --> 00:33:02.059
overloaded.

00:33:03.420 --> 00:33:04.180
Would you like

00:33:05.620 --> 00:33:06.620
to collaborate with her?

00:33:22.539 --> 00:33:23.019
Enter.

00:33:25.620 --> 00:33:27.460
Didn't you say
you'd be home with your kid?

00:33:28.140 --> 00:33:29.299
Why are you still here?

00:33:29.579 --> 00:33:30.380
I was about to leave

00:33:30.380 --> 00:33:31.620
when a client called.

00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:32.779
An hour of talking.

00:33:32.779 --> 00:33:34.420
My throat's practically burning.

00:33:34.940 --> 00:33:36.700
I told the interns this afternoon

00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:37.860
to leave on time

00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:38.779
and go straight home.

00:33:39.099 --> 00:33:40.380
Shouldn't their mentoring lawyer

00:33:40.739 --> 00:33:42.099
lead by example?

00:33:43.499 --> 00:33:44.819
What's this? Are you becoming

00:33:44.819 --> 00:33:46.499
their "Agony Aunt" now?

00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:49.499
Or did the assessment results

00:33:50.180 --> 00:33:51.019
break someone?

00:33:51.700 --> 00:33:52.499
You're wrong.

00:33:53.299 --> 00:33:54.940
They're all competing for more tasks.

00:33:56.019 --> 00:33:56.819
Online, people say

00:33:56.819 --> 00:33:58.420
young people embrace slacking off,

00:33:58.940 --> 00:33:59.860
but I think it's wrong.

00:34:00.220 --> 00:34:01.259
They're all so driven.

00:34:01.579 --> 00:34:03.420
Way better than we were.

00:34:04.660 --> 00:34:05.539
Be more precise.

00:34:06.259 --> 00:34:07.539
Not "we".

00:34:09.460 --> 00:34:09.820
You...

00:34:09.820 --> 00:34:11.499
But this could be good for them.

00:34:12.019 --> 00:34:13.139
At their age,

00:34:13.139 --> 00:34:14.340
learning to cooperate

00:34:14.460 --> 00:34:15.699
is harder than competition.

00:34:16.900 --> 00:34:17.340
True.

00:34:18.260 --> 00:34:19.099
We battled every day

00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:19.980
back then.

00:34:21.619 --> 00:34:22.460
It wasn't a battle.

00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:24.539
You were just losing to me every day.

00:34:24.820 --> 00:34:25.300
Fine, fine.

00:34:25.740 --> 00:34:27.099
I keep losing to you now, happy?

00:34:28.420 --> 00:34:30.099
Go home to your daughter.
I'll drive you.

00:34:31.499 --> 00:34:33.460
Don't you have anything else going on?

00:34:34.059 --> 00:34:34.940
No need

00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:36.740
to take female clients out for dinner?

00:34:37.059 --> 00:34:37.619
Ms. Bai,

00:34:38.260 --> 00:34:39.780
middle-aged greasiness is not good.

00:34:40.179 --> 00:34:42.059
I'm still the heartthrob of our firm.

00:34:42.380 --> 00:34:44.099
Decent and principled.

00:34:44.380 --> 00:34:45.659
You got time to mock me,

00:34:45.900 --> 00:34:47.699
but no time to go home to your kid?

00:34:48.780 --> 00:34:50.699
Aren't you traveling for work tomorrow?

00:34:53.139 --> 00:34:53.499
Alright.

00:34:54.460 --> 00:34:54.980
Let's go.

00:34:55.260 --> 00:34:55.619
Go.

00:35:12.499 --> 00:35:12.940
Mr. Zhou.

00:35:13.659 --> 00:35:15.019
I sent Ms. Bai the updated file

00:35:15.019 --> 00:35:15.780
this morning.

00:35:15.780 --> 00:35:16.860
She hasn't responded.

00:35:16.940 --> 00:35:18.019
Do you know the situation?

00:35:18.499 --> 00:35:19.340
She's away for work.

00:35:19.619 --> 00:35:20.780
Probably on a flight now.

00:35:22.980 --> 00:35:23.420
Mr. Zhou,

00:35:23.619 --> 00:35:24.579
do you have any tasks

00:35:24.579 --> 00:35:25.460
I could assist with?

00:35:26.019 --> 00:35:27.019
On my end...

00:35:27.860 --> 00:35:28.260
The firm

00:35:29.059 --> 00:35:31.420
is offering community legal guidance
this Saturday.

00:35:31.900 --> 00:35:33.219
I signed up last night.

00:35:34.940 --> 00:35:36.380
How much work have you taken on?

00:35:36.659 --> 00:35:37.340
Three months.

00:35:37.340 --> 00:35:38.499
Can your health handle this?

00:35:39.099 --> 00:35:40.179
Ms. Bai's work is hard.

00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:41.340
You can ask for help.

00:35:41.980 --> 00:35:43.300
No need. I can manage.

00:35:44.499 --> 00:35:45.900
Independent completion is ideal,

00:35:47.420 --> 00:35:48.980
but cooperation matters as well.

00:35:49.380 --> 00:35:50.900
Jun An always emphasizes teamwork.

00:35:51.619 --> 00:35:52.980
I worked hard to get

00:35:52.980 --> 00:35:54.539
this opportunity to work with Ms. Bai.

00:35:54.940 --> 00:35:55.900
I want to prove myself

00:35:56.099 --> 00:35:56.780
and do it alone.

00:35:59.179 --> 00:35:59.579
Okay.

00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:00.699
It's your call.

00:36:04.619 --> 00:36:06.300
Quitting time in about 10 minutes.

00:36:07.179 --> 00:36:08.420
Friday nights

00:36:08.499 --> 00:36:11.539
are corporate drones' happiest hours.

00:36:11.980 --> 00:36:12.740
Seriously,

00:36:12.980 --> 00:36:14.179
this single week

00:36:14.219 --> 00:36:15.900
felt like an entire lifetime.

00:36:16.300 --> 00:36:17.940
I've sprouted new wrinkles.

00:36:19.380 --> 00:36:20.420
My friends

00:36:20.420 --> 00:36:21.659
invited me out this weekend.

00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:24.139
Now I decide I won't leave my bed

00:36:24.139 --> 00:36:25.579
even if they kill me.

00:36:25.860 --> 00:36:26.539
Same here.

00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:29.340
Quality sleep is great.

00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:30.860
Rest up to recharge

00:36:30.860 --> 00:36:31.820
for upcoming tasks.

00:36:32.179 --> 00:36:33.420
Mr. Zhou, another assessment?

00:36:34.380 --> 00:36:36.219
Next week is the third task

00:36:36.219 --> 00:36:36.980
of the first round.

00:36:37.420 --> 00:36:38.260
Once results are out,

00:36:38.260 --> 00:36:39.300
you'll get ranked

00:36:39.460 --> 00:36:40.740
based on accumulated points.

00:36:41.219 --> 00:36:42.460
So the lowest scorer this time

00:36:42.460 --> 00:36:43.499
gets eliminated?

00:36:46.699 --> 00:36:47.019
Right.

00:36:47.179 --> 00:36:48.179
Jiang Chen, Ren Jiatong,

00:36:48.179 --> 00:36:49.659
I'll add you to the group chat

00:36:49.659 --> 00:36:50.699
for the legal aid event.

00:36:50.940 --> 00:36:51.980
Tomorrow at 8 AM,

00:36:52.179 --> 00:36:53.260
the bus leaves from Jun An.

00:36:59.099 --> 00:37:00.539
Are you two human-shaped AI?

00:37:00.900 --> 00:37:02.059
Don't you need rest?

00:37:02.659 --> 00:37:04.659
Finally a weekend,
and you signed up for it?

00:37:11.464 --> 00:37:12.456
(Pro Bono Legal Aid)

00:37:12.456 --> 00:37:15.546
(Explanation: Legal professionals)

00:37:15.546 --> 00:37:19.016
(provide free legal guidance
to the public.)

00:37:22.619 --> 00:37:23.619
(Jun An Law Firm's Public Service Team)
Put the things

00:37:23.619 --> 00:37:25.139
at designated spots.

00:37:25.619 --> 00:37:27.420
Conduct legal education sessions
at stations

00:37:27.460 --> 00:37:28.780
or walk through neighborhoods.

00:37:29.260 --> 00:37:30.659
Coordinate with community staff,

00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:32.300
identify potential clients,

00:37:32.300 --> 00:37:32.980
and register them

00:37:33.059 --> 00:37:34.019
for future follow-up.

00:37:40.820 --> 00:37:41.420
Is it heavy?

00:37:41.420 --> 00:37:42.300
You should've told me.

00:37:42.980 --> 00:37:44.099
I've trained for this.

00:37:44.340 --> 00:37:45.820
I could carry the water and you.

00:37:46.460 --> 00:37:46.820
Okay.

00:37:46.860 --> 00:37:47.900
You should play the lead

00:37:47.900 --> 00:37:48.780
in Wonder Woman.

00:37:49.059 --> 00:37:49.659
Let me hurry up

00:37:49.659 --> 00:37:50.980
and email that screenwriter.

00:37:51.380 --> 00:37:54.059
Suggest using your story as inspiration.

00:37:54.219 --> 00:37:56.139
Make it about a lawyer by day

00:37:56.139 --> 00:37:57.539
and superheroine by night.

00:37:57.860 --> 00:37:59.499
From Fengtai, Haidian,

00:37:59.499 --> 00:38:01.139
to Dongba, Changying,
all your territory.

00:38:01.499 --> 00:38:03.380
Punch every villain
into the stratosphere.

00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:06.139
This script would definitely flop.

00:38:06.539 --> 00:38:08.139
I'd watch it in a heartbeat.

00:38:09.059 --> 00:38:09.619
Young man.

00:38:09.780 --> 00:38:10.179
Sir.

00:38:10.900 --> 00:38:12.059
Are you screenwriters?

00:38:12.460 --> 00:38:13.820
Sir, we're not screenwriters.

00:38:14.099 --> 00:38:14.619
We're law...

00:38:16.900 --> 00:38:18.780
We're interns at Jun An Law Firm.

00:38:19.499 --> 00:38:20.380
This event.

00:38:20.780 --> 00:38:22.539
Do you need legal consultation?

00:38:23.460 --> 00:38:24.539
I'm retired.

00:38:25.059 --> 00:38:26.059
I wrote a novel

00:38:26.539 --> 00:38:28.260
and then adapted it into a screenplay.

00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:30.340
If you were screenwriters,

00:38:30.539 --> 00:38:32.380
I'd ask for some advice.

00:38:32.820 --> 00:38:34.579
But lawyers? No need.

00:38:35.099 --> 00:38:36.019
Not that serious.

00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:37.820
Not that level yet.

00:38:37.820 --> 00:38:39.099
But you may need it.

00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:39.619
Well.

00:38:40.460 --> 00:38:41.860
Take down my number,

00:38:42.300 --> 00:38:44.179
and call me anytime

00:38:44.300 --> 00:38:45.300
if you need advice.

00:38:45.380 --> 00:38:45.699
Okay.

00:38:45.780 --> 00:38:47.179
I know little about screenwriting,

00:38:47.179 --> 00:38:48.179
but I love movies.

00:38:48.380 --> 00:38:49.740
My classmate works in Hollywood.

00:38:50.179 --> 00:38:50.659
No trouble.

00:38:50.980 --> 00:38:51.260
Okay.

00:38:52.460 --> 00:38:53.499
Excuse me for a moment.

00:38:57.780 --> 00:38:59.260
I need to ask you something.

00:39:11.179 --> 00:39:11.619
You came.

00:39:12.539 --> 00:39:12.900
Sit.

00:39:16.099 --> 00:39:16.860
Let me tell you.

00:39:17.460 --> 00:39:18.460
Yan Fei, my sister.

00:39:19.139 --> 00:39:19.499
Fei,

00:39:19.860 --> 00:39:20.499
this is Eddie.

00:39:21.059 --> 00:39:22.219
The second son of Mr. Jiang.

00:39:22.820 --> 00:39:24.579
Mr. Jiang said you two attended

00:39:24.860 --> 00:39:26.300
a summer camp in America together.

00:39:26.980 --> 00:39:27.900
Childhood friends.

00:39:29.699 --> 00:39:30.219
Sophia.

00:39:30.820 --> 00:39:31.539
You didn't change.

00:39:31.940 --> 00:39:32.699
Still as beautiful.

00:39:33.380 --> 00:39:35.659
Honestly, you've changed quite a bit.

00:39:36.179 --> 00:39:37.460
You looked good as a kid.

00:39:38.699 --> 00:39:39.139
Fei,

00:39:40.059 --> 00:39:42.059
Eddie manages the global division

00:39:42.139 --> 00:39:43.219
for Mr. Jiang's company.

00:39:43.780 --> 00:39:44.659
They need lawyers.

00:39:45.380 --> 00:39:46.260
You two should talk.

00:39:46.699 --> 00:39:48.219
You might collaborate in the future.

00:39:49.740 --> 00:39:50.539
You need a lawyer?

00:39:51.219 --> 00:39:51.820
Why?

00:39:52.659 --> 00:39:54.260
Legal troubles lately?

00:39:54.340 --> 00:39:55.420
A debtor won't pay?

00:39:57.300 --> 00:39:59.260
Divorce? Planning to divorce?

00:40:00.099 --> 00:40:01.619
I can't represent you in this,

00:40:01.619 --> 00:40:03.340
but I know good lawyers.

00:40:03.699 --> 00:40:04.139
Listen.

00:40:04.139 --> 00:40:06.539
Divorce is tricky.
Not major but complicated.

00:40:06.900 --> 00:40:08.219
With kids involved,

00:40:08.219 --> 00:40:09.699
you'll lose some assets.

00:40:10.019 --> 00:40:12.579
Successful guys like you

00:40:12.780 --> 00:40:14.380
are usually at fault.

00:40:14.539 --> 00:40:16.099
So maybe...

00:40:16.099 --> 00:40:16.659
Yan Fei.

00:40:20.260 --> 00:40:21.340
Are you out of your mind?

00:40:22.380 --> 00:40:23.420
Dad told me

00:40:23.539 --> 00:40:25.260
to introduce you to decent men.

00:40:25.499 --> 00:40:26.860
That's why I brought Eddie.

00:40:27.460 --> 00:40:28.659
Why take it out on me?

00:40:29.340 --> 00:40:31.340
I've told you a thousand times.

00:40:31.340 --> 00:40:34.260
I'll date when I want to.

00:40:34.420 --> 00:40:36.659
Stop introducing your partners' sons

00:40:36.659 --> 00:40:37.940
or grandsons to me.

00:40:38.139 --> 00:40:39.420
We've only been rich recently

00:40:39.659 --> 00:40:41.460
and are already pushing
arranged marriages?

00:40:41.460 --> 00:40:42.380
Or inheritance schemes?

00:40:42.820 --> 00:40:44.059
Say that to Mom and Dad.

00:40:44.820 --> 00:40:45.860
I'm just the messenger.

00:40:46.380 --> 00:40:47.740
I even paid for lunch.

00:40:48.059 --> 00:40:48.980
What did I do wrong?

00:40:50.099 --> 00:40:51.900
You broke up
with the British guy years ago.

00:40:51.900 --> 00:40:52.619
Why still single?

00:40:53.659 --> 00:40:54.900
But I'm still young.

00:40:54.900 --> 00:40:56.300
Why are you all in such a hurry?

00:40:56.980 --> 00:40:57.820
And let me tell you.

00:40:58.059 --> 00:41:00.499
This internship is getting
more interesting by the day.

00:41:00.499 --> 00:41:01.900
Competition is so exciting.

00:41:02.059 --> 00:41:02.740
Think it's fun?

00:41:04.699 --> 00:41:06.340
Keep doing this internship longer.

00:41:07.420 --> 00:41:08.300
If you're tired of it,

00:41:08.820 --> 00:41:09.820
focus on looking good,

00:41:09.980 --> 00:41:10.579
dating,

00:41:10.820 --> 00:41:11.499
and social media.

00:41:11.860 --> 00:41:12.499
So good.

00:41:12.940 --> 00:41:13.619
Could you...?

00:41:15.579 --> 00:41:16.340
Wasting my breath.

00:41:16.699 --> 00:41:17.740
I've got things to do.

00:41:29.659 --> 00:41:30.499
Listen, Zhou Nian.

00:41:30.860 --> 00:41:32.019
You need to set a deadline.

00:41:32.260 --> 00:41:34.499
Can you get the wedding apartment
ready by year-end?

00:41:34.900 --> 00:41:36.340
It's been so long.

00:41:37.579 --> 00:41:38.420
Our daughter

00:41:38.579 --> 00:41:39.740
was a fresh blossom,

00:41:40.019 --> 00:41:42.300
but now, she's wilting with you.

00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:43.780
Exactly.

00:41:44.740 --> 00:41:46.340
When will you arrange a job for me?

00:41:47.219 --> 00:41:48.300
I remember.

00:41:48.900 --> 00:41:50.099
You better remember.

00:41:57.940 --> 00:41:58.340
Hello.

00:41:58.900 --> 00:41:59.380
Chenchen,

00:42:00.099 --> 00:42:01.260
you don't have to see me,

00:42:01.420 --> 00:42:02.900
but you must return to Chongqing.

00:42:03.380 --> 00:42:04.340
Your father's law firm

00:42:04.340 --> 00:42:05.619
started during our marriage.

00:42:05.619 --> 00:42:06.579
I own a share of it.

00:42:06.820 --> 00:42:07.940
You promised to help me

00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:09.260
get it back.

00:42:09.980 --> 00:42:11.300
Mom, I want to see you,

00:42:11.579 --> 00:42:12.539
but I don't understand.

00:42:12.539 --> 00:42:14.260
You never asked for any money before.

00:42:14.260 --> 00:42:15.059
Why are you suddenly

00:42:15.499 --> 00:42:16.619
demanding money now?

00:42:17.860 --> 00:42:19.139
Don't pressure me, okay?

00:42:19.499 --> 00:42:20.780
I don't want to ask for money.

00:42:20.980 --> 00:42:21.900
Me? Pressure you?

00:42:22.300 --> 00:42:23.980
I'm doing this for your own good.

00:42:24.099 --> 00:42:25.179
Your "self-reliance" story.

00:42:25.179 --> 00:42:25.940
Is that true?

00:42:26.380 --> 00:42:27.619
Your college fees abroad...

00:42:27.780 --> 00:42:28.059
You...

00:42:28.780 --> 00:42:30.219
I sold our house to fund you.

00:42:30.980 --> 00:42:32.059
The money

00:42:32.059 --> 00:42:33.579
is being gradually repaid, isn't it?

00:42:33.860 --> 00:42:35.179
We already agreed before

00:42:35.179 --> 00:42:36.420
if I stayed

00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:37.980
at the American law firm for two years,

00:42:37.980 --> 00:42:38.980
I'd earn back the money.

00:42:39.219 --> 00:42:40.820
But you insisted I return, didn't you?

00:42:41.260 --> 00:42:42.740
Why can't you trust me?

00:42:43.499 --> 00:42:44.499
I asked you to return

00:42:44.499 --> 00:42:46.619
because you're entitled
to your father's firm.

00:42:47.099 --> 00:42:48.579
How can you be so naive?

00:42:49.219 --> 00:42:50.300
You say I don't trust you?

00:42:50.619 --> 00:42:51.380
If I didn't,

00:42:51.380 --> 00:42:53.179
I'd sell our house
for your Haryald education?

00:42:53.860 --> 00:42:55.099
You're my only son.

00:42:55.340 --> 00:42:57.019
How can you say such things to me?

00:42:58.139 --> 00:42:59.579
Mom, give me three more months

00:43:00.780 --> 00:43:02.619
to win first place
in the Talent Hunt Program.

00:43:03.300 --> 00:43:04.940
I don't need to inherit anything.

00:43:05.260 --> 00:43:06.179
Have you considered it?

00:43:06.460 --> 00:43:08.059
What if you don't make it to the end?

00:43:15.312 --> 00:43:16.136
(Why are the candidates in the program
just interns, not trainee lawyers?)

00:43:16.166 --> 00:43:16.726
(A trainee lawyer is a formal employee
with a signed contract at a law firm.)

00:43:16.726 --> 00:43:17.320
(They have passed the National Unified
Legal Profession Qualification Examination.)

00:43:17.320 --> 00:43:17.846
(They undergo internships
to become a qualified lawyer.)

00:43:17.846 --> 00:43:18.536
(The "internship" for trainee lawyers
is a legally required entry procedure.)

00:43:18.536 --> 00:43:21.000
(The program candidates are students.)

00:43:23.048 --> 00:43:26.376
(They're doing a regular internship.)
