00:01:59.256 --> 00:02:00.897
When I count to three,

00:02:01.336 --> 00:02:03.176
I'll make my move.

00:02:05.496 --> 00:02:06.736
Three...

00:02:09.416 --> 00:02:11.057
You really are calculating

00:02:11.297 --> 00:02:12.497
and good at biding your time.

00:02:12.856 --> 00:02:14.737
Your first attempt
with the Yang poison failed.

00:02:14.897 --> 00:02:15.655
The second time,

00:02:15.656 --> 00:02:17.577
you used my bond with Chu Moshang

00:02:17.816 --> 00:02:19.337
to lure him back to me
from the sanctuary,

00:02:19.376 --> 00:02:21.176
even after he lost his dragon pearl.

00:02:21.177 --> 00:02:23.816
You think you can lecture me
like a sister-in-law.

00:02:24.017 --> 00:02:25.016
Even your tone

00:02:25.017 --> 00:02:27.096
sounds like Moshang now.

00:02:32.417 --> 00:02:34.096
You went to all this trouble

00:02:34.177 --> 00:02:35.736
just to use this chance
to get rid of me,

00:02:35.737 --> 00:02:36.816
didn't you?

00:02:38.096 --> 00:02:39.136
Yes.

00:02:39.376 --> 00:02:40.816
As long as you're alive,

00:02:41.376 --> 00:02:44.256
I'll always be Father's second choice.

00:02:44.496 --> 00:02:45.816
As for her,

00:02:45.977 --> 00:02:47.416
she can't live either.

00:02:47.737 --> 00:02:50.376
She actually carries
the bloodline of the Dragons.

00:02:53.417 --> 00:02:56.057
Looks like I have another
mess to clean up.

00:02:57.816 --> 00:03:00.096
Take the heart-guard scale
to the Chu residence.

00:03:00.177 --> 00:03:01.337
I'll come for you.

00:03:01.737 --> 00:03:02.897
Be careful.

00:03:03.216 --> 00:03:04.577
Promise me you'll come back to me.

00:03:10.656 --> 00:03:11.976
Chu Moshang,

00:03:12.616 --> 00:03:15.096
I think love has made you
lose your mind.

00:03:15.457 --> 00:03:17.870
You actually risked your life
pulling out your heart-guard scale.

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:19.096
You're dead today.

00:04:05.656 --> 00:04:06.856
Why are you standing out here?

00:04:06.977 --> 00:04:08.177
You're pregnant.

00:04:08.376 --> 00:04:09.095
Come on.

00:04:09.096 --> 00:04:10.017
Let's go inside.

00:04:20.616 --> 00:04:21.495
I had someone

00:04:21.496 --> 00:04:23.017
bring these pastries back from Wujing.

00:04:23.137 --> 00:04:24.137
Have something sweet.

00:04:24.336 --> 00:04:25.536
It'll take the bitterness away.

00:04:35.976 --> 00:04:36.897
It really is sweet.

00:04:39.697 --> 00:04:41.536
Ever since I met you,

00:04:41.937 --> 00:04:43.616
you've always been a handful.

00:04:44.216 --> 00:04:45.535
You find trouble everywhere.

00:04:45.536 --> 00:04:47.817
You're stubborn,
and you rub people the wrong way.

00:04:48.497 --> 00:04:49.937
Don't blame Father.

00:04:50.736 --> 00:04:52.257
He really had no choice.

00:04:55.497 --> 00:04:57.017
Marrying someone like me

00:04:58.057 --> 00:04:59.457
has been such a burden on you.

00:05:01.377 --> 00:05:03.777
I made you suffer at home.

00:05:05.017 --> 00:05:06.017
I'm sorry.

00:05:06.096 --> 00:05:08.017
At least I helped you
find your spiritual root

00:05:08.096 --> 00:05:09.217
so you can cultivate.

00:05:09.897 --> 00:05:11.137
You're intelligent.

00:05:11.377 --> 00:05:12.616
You hate following the rules.

00:05:13.137 --> 00:05:14.817
You learn the hard way.

00:05:14.976 --> 00:05:16.096
You've become more composed

00:05:16.257 --> 00:05:17.457
when handling things.

00:05:25.377 --> 00:05:26.457
Chu Moshang,

00:05:26.697 --> 00:05:29.096
I know something happened to you.

00:05:29.137 --> 00:05:29.856
But,

00:05:30.937 --> 00:05:32.697
don't leave me behind, okay?

00:05:33.497 --> 00:05:34.377
We...

00:05:35.176 --> 00:05:37.017
We and the child still have a future,

00:05:37.497 --> 00:05:38.137
right?

00:05:38.416 --> 00:05:39.697
When this is all over,

00:05:40.096 --> 00:05:41.416
Father will understand

00:05:41.697 --> 00:05:43.056
why I chose to marry you.

00:05:43.096 --> 00:05:44.176
As for our child,

00:05:44.817 --> 00:05:45.897
if he's like you,

00:05:46.176 --> 00:05:47.496
I'll have nothing to worry about.

00:05:47.937 --> 00:05:49.056
We'll just have to teach him

00:05:49.176 --> 00:05:50.656
not to be as uptight as me.

00:05:51.457 --> 00:05:52.856
That's exhausting.

00:06:06.656 --> 00:06:07.616
Chu Moshang,

00:06:10.296 --> 00:06:12.257
I don't like what you're saying.

00:06:13.057 --> 00:06:14.137
Tell me.

00:06:14.457 --> 00:06:16.736
Did you already get rid of Nie Rongzhi?

00:06:25.216 --> 00:06:26.296
I know.

00:06:26.577 --> 00:06:28.056
I'm still dreaming right now.

00:06:28.377 --> 00:06:29.377
Chu Moshang,

00:06:29.497 --> 00:06:31.257
if you lose the dragon pearl,

00:06:31.697 --> 00:06:33.616
you'll be at Nie Rongzhi's mercy.

00:06:33.617 --> 00:06:35.496
Once he becomes the Dragon King,

00:06:35.697 --> 00:06:37.855
he'll never let you survive.

00:06:37.856 --> 00:06:38.976
If that's how it ends,

00:06:39.497 --> 00:06:41.056
it means I wasn't strong enough.

00:06:41.377 --> 00:06:42.777
It has nothing to do with you.

00:06:43.096 --> 00:06:43.937
Zhilou,

00:06:44.497 --> 00:06:45.656
our duty

00:06:45.776 --> 00:06:47.817
was never to become
Dragon King and Queen.

00:06:48.057 --> 00:06:50.056
We have something more important to do.

00:06:56.176 --> 00:06:57.096
I know.

00:06:57.536 --> 00:06:59.536
We've always understood each other.

00:07:00.216 --> 00:07:01.496
Before I came here,

00:07:01.697 --> 00:07:03.536
I told Hunbao the same thing.

00:07:03.736 --> 00:07:05.017
You want to protect your family

00:07:05.457 --> 00:07:06.697
and Feng Manor,

00:07:07.296 --> 00:07:09.176
but you don't have to become
the Wujing Saintess.

00:07:09.536 --> 00:07:10.936
I want to protect the sanctuary,

00:07:10.937 --> 00:07:12.817
but I don't have to be Dragon King.

00:07:13.257 --> 00:07:15.897
I'm a Dragon God
with thousands of years' lifespan.

00:07:16.137 --> 00:07:18.056
I feel deeply
for every part of this world

00:07:18.057 --> 00:07:19.536
and every living being in it.

00:07:20.017 --> 00:07:22.056
Protecting everything I cherish

00:07:22.577 --> 00:07:24.296
is what I've been doing all along.

00:07:24.536 --> 00:07:25.616
But I'll

00:07:25.937 --> 00:07:27.217
make your path

00:07:27.377 --> 00:07:28.897
harder than it should be.

00:07:31.697 --> 00:07:32.616
Zhilou,

00:07:32.937 --> 00:07:34.257
you saved my life.

00:07:35.057 --> 00:07:36.096
Without you,

00:07:36.497 --> 00:07:38.175
the Yang poison would have killed me.

00:07:38.176 --> 00:07:39.616
I wouldn't have survived.

00:07:39.976 --> 00:07:41.217
But marrying you

00:07:41.577 --> 00:07:42.736
was never about repayment.

00:07:43.617 --> 00:07:44.736
It was duty.

00:07:45.257 --> 00:07:46.817
It was love that found me
before I noticed.

00:07:47.497 --> 00:07:48.656
It was instinct.

00:07:49.577 --> 00:07:51.017
It was a natural pull toward you.

00:08:05.697 --> 00:08:07.176
How is Zhilou doing?

00:08:07.257 --> 00:08:08.496
Hunbao, come with me right now.

00:08:08.497 --> 00:08:10.457
Something happened to Prince Shang
and Feng Zhilou.

00:08:11.257 --> 00:08:11.976
Let's go.

00:08:18.176 --> 00:08:19.056
I'm sorry.

00:08:19.057 --> 00:08:21.056
You'll have to go on alone,

00:08:21.697 --> 00:08:23.377
but my heart-guard scale

00:08:23.897 --> 00:08:25.656
will always protect you.

00:08:27.656 --> 00:08:28.577
No.

00:08:30.656 --> 00:08:31.976
I don't want to be alone.

00:08:32.057 --> 00:08:33.176
Miss Zhilou.

00:08:33.776 --> 00:08:34.937
Miss Zhilou.

00:08:35.416 --> 00:08:36.897
Miss Zhilou, please wake up.

00:08:37.017 --> 00:08:37.976
Miss Zhilou.

00:08:39.217 --> 00:08:40.417
Miss Zhilou.

00:08:43.296 --> 00:08:44.856
What happened?

00:08:45.296 --> 00:08:46.657
What's wrong with me?

00:08:47.217 --> 00:08:48.457
Where's Chu Moshang?

00:08:48.536 --> 00:08:50.217
You passed out at the main gate.

00:08:50.536 --> 00:08:52.537
We brought you here.

00:08:53.377 --> 00:08:54.697
Miss Zhilou,

00:08:54.776 --> 00:08:55.976
what you're holding

00:08:56.137 --> 00:08:57.776
is Prince Shang's heart-guard scale.

00:09:10.137 --> 00:09:11.096
Chu Moshang.

00:09:11.176 --> 00:09:12.575
Chu Moshang, wake up.

00:09:12.576 --> 00:09:14.856
We've only kept
Prince Shang alive for now,

00:09:14.857 --> 00:09:16.096
but his injuries are too severe.

00:09:16.176 --> 00:09:17.417
His organs are all damaged.

00:09:17.536 --> 00:09:18.775
He's lost consciousness.

00:09:18.776 --> 00:09:20.376
Without the dragon pearl to heal him,

00:09:20.377 --> 00:09:21.976
he won't last long.

00:09:21.977 --> 00:09:23.415
We've done everything we can.

00:09:23.416 --> 00:09:25.177
He may be beyond saving.

00:09:25.857 --> 00:09:27.417
What do you mean beyond saving?

00:09:28.617 --> 00:09:30.337
That only means your skills are lacking.

00:09:37.456 --> 00:09:38.655
How is that possible?

00:09:38.656 --> 00:09:40.736
He's the Dragon Prince.

00:09:41.217 --> 00:09:42.937
How could he possibly die?

00:09:45.017 --> 00:09:46.815
We failed to protect Prince Shang.

00:09:46.816 --> 00:09:48.096
We failed you.

00:09:48.097 --> 00:09:50.177
Why am I just a bird?

00:09:53.097 --> 00:09:54.457
What exactly happened?

00:10:37.296 --> 00:10:38.297
Your Highness!

00:10:53.936 --> 00:10:55.496
Let's go back to the Chu residence.

00:11:01.617 --> 00:11:04.297
Prince Shang might have
foreseen his own end.

00:11:04.617 --> 00:11:05.775
He pulled out his one and only

00:11:05.776 --> 00:11:07.337
heart-guard scale for you in advance

00:11:07.737 --> 00:11:10.976
and used an illusion
to keep you from the truth.

00:11:11.056 --> 00:11:12.096
For thousands of years,

00:11:12.097 --> 00:11:14.736
Prince Shang has carried
the weight of the Dragons.

00:11:15.137 --> 00:11:16.600
He was always alone,

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:18.695
traveling everywhere to stop disasters
and slay demons.

00:11:18.696 --> 00:11:20.057
He never complained.

00:11:20.497 --> 00:11:22.616
To keep himself out of danger,

00:11:22.617 --> 00:11:24.216
Prince Shang turned his reverse scale

00:11:24.217 --> 00:11:25.817
into the sigil.

00:11:25.936 --> 00:11:28.096
It holds part of his Dragon God power.

00:11:28.816 --> 00:11:31.256
Yet somehow, you ended up with it.

00:11:31.296 --> 00:11:32.935
You must have felt it.

00:11:32.936 --> 00:11:34.815
Whenever you were in danger,

00:11:34.816 --> 00:11:37.136
Prince Shang's power would protect you.

00:11:37.296 --> 00:11:39.457
If the dragon pearl were still with him,

00:11:39.737 --> 00:11:41.937
it might help him heal slowly.

00:11:42.536 --> 00:11:43.177
But

00:11:44.296 --> 00:11:46.177
His Majesty took his dragon pearl

00:11:46.257 --> 00:11:47.856
to force him to leave you

00:11:47.857 --> 00:11:49.016
and marry Liluo.

00:11:49.017 --> 00:11:50.896
Without his reverse scale
and heart-guard scale,

00:11:50.897 --> 00:11:53.815
and after battling Nie Rongzhi,
he used up the last shred of his power.

00:11:53.816 --> 00:11:55.055
His soul has shattered.

00:11:55.056 --> 00:11:56.057
Now,

00:11:56.097 --> 00:11:58.256
even if the dragon pearl
returned to his body,

00:11:58.257 --> 00:11:59.775
it may not wake him.

00:11:59.776 --> 00:12:02.057
He's nothing but an empty shell.

00:12:03.977 --> 00:12:04.736
Are you alright?

00:12:04.737 --> 00:12:05.856
I don't matter.

00:12:06.296 --> 00:12:07.457
What matters is that

00:12:07.816 --> 00:12:09.655
Prince Shang is critically injured

00:12:09.656 --> 00:12:11.776
If Nie Rongzhi becomes Dragon King,

00:12:12.137 --> 00:12:14.240
what will happen to the sanctuary
and the mortal realm?

00:12:15.257 --> 00:12:16.337
Chu Moshang,

00:12:17.737 --> 00:12:19.616
I never knew

00:12:20.056 --> 00:12:22.136
the sigil you gave me,

00:12:22.456 --> 00:12:23.537
the Fire Phoenix pendant,

00:12:23.816 --> 00:12:25.577
and the heart-guard scale

00:12:25.857 --> 00:12:27.586
were all so precious.

00:12:27.587 --> 00:12:29.070
♪Like petals fall, gone with the clouds♪

00:12:29.456 --> 00:12:30.224
It turns out

00:12:30.225 --> 00:12:31.935
♪Like stars fade fast in open skies♪

00:12:31.936 --> 00:12:34.417
they're all pieces of your life.

00:12:35.450 --> 00:12:37.575
♪Like snowflakes melting softly
in the evening haze♪

00:12:37.576 --> 00:12:38.776
I don't care.

00:12:38.977 --> 00:12:40.976
I don't care when you might fade away.

00:12:41.536 --> 00:12:43.775
I don't care how great the cost is.

00:12:43.776 --> 00:12:46.297
I'll gather every piece back.

00:12:46.576 --> 00:12:48.336
I'll make sure you are fully restored.

00:12:48.337 --> 00:12:53.175
♪Like fireflies flicker
through wild grass, fleeting light♪

00:12:53.176 --> 00:12:54.695
It's Prince Shang's soul.

00:12:54.696 --> 00:12:57.057
His soul is inside
the heart-guard scale.

00:12:57.536 --> 00:12:58.496
No wonder.

00:12:58.776 --> 00:12:59.976
Just now,

00:13:00.137 --> 00:13:02.211
I had a very long dream.

00:13:03.656 --> 00:13:05.016
I dreamed that he

00:13:05.296 --> 00:13:07.417
was standing in front of me
safe and sound.

00:13:07.696 --> 00:13:09.386
That wasn't entirely a dream.

00:13:10.696 --> 00:13:11.936
It was his soul

00:13:13.056 --> 00:13:14.496
staying with me the whole time.

00:13:14.497 --> 00:13:16.096
The Dragons only give

00:13:16.176 --> 00:13:18.417
the heart-guard scale to their beloved.

00:13:18.936 --> 00:13:21.320
Because beneath the heart-guard scale
lies the dragon pearl.

00:13:21.337 --> 00:13:22.817
Protecting the dragon pearl

00:13:22.977 --> 00:13:24.695
means protecting their own life.

00:13:24.696 --> 00:13:26.616
Prince Shang gave you
his heart-guard scale

00:13:26.617 --> 00:13:28.057
was his choice.

00:13:28.257 --> 00:13:29.496
He must believe

00:13:29.617 --> 00:13:31.697
that you're more important
than his own life.

00:13:32.137 --> 00:13:33.337
I think Prince Shang

00:13:33.377 --> 00:13:35.057
has no regrets.

00:13:35.337 --> 00:13:39.216
Even if you return the heart-guard scale,
without the dragon pearl to guard him

00:13:39.217 --> 00:13:40.695
and restore his Dragon God power,

00:13:40.696 --> 00:13:42.817
his injuries are still beyond saving.

00:13:45.416 --> 00:13:48.736
The dragon pearl can save him?
You must go back to the sanctuary now.

00:13:48.737 --> 00:13:49.480
Absolutely not.

00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:51.960
Prince Shang was willing to give up
the dragon pearl and the throne

00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:53.177
just to come to your side.

00:13:56.296 --> 00:13:57.177
Fei Yuan.

00:13:57.816 --> 00:13:58.697
Bai Lu.

00:13:58.816 --> 00:13:59.935
I, Feng Zhilou,

00:13:59.936 --> 00:14:01.256
beg you both.

00:14:01.257 --> 00:14:02.577
Go back to the sanctuary now

00:14:02.617 --> 00:14:03.937
and tell the Dragon King

00:14:04.137 --> 00:14:05.177
that Chu Moshang

00:14:05.416 --> 00:14:07.776
insisted on staying with me

00:14:08.497 --> 00:14:10.457
because I'm pregnant.

00:14:11.737 --> 00:14:13.815
If I were just a human girl,

00:14:13.816 --> 00:14:15.136
three years from now

00:14:15.296 --> 00:14:16.775
when I give birth to the dragon child,

00:14:16.776 --> 00:14:18.697
I wouldn't survive.

00:14:19.176 --> 00:14:21.057
Whether they believe it or not,

00:14:21.176 --> 00:14:23.256
I carry the Wujing Saintess' bloodline.

00:14:23.977 --> 00:14:25.136
A dragon child?

00:14:25.696 --> 00:14:26.295
This...

00:14:26.296 --> 00:14:27.896
This is a blessing.

00:14:27.936 --> 00:14:29.535
Even unions between the Dragons

00:14:29.536 --> 00:14:31.376
rarely produce offsprings now.

00:14:32.497 --> 00:14:33.655
I'll go through fire and water

00:14:33.656 --> 00:14:35.016
to get it done!

00:14:36.497 --> 00:14:37.616
Hunbao's set up

00:14:37.857 --> 00:14:39.415
an invisibility barrier for you.

00:14:39.416 --> 00:14:40.496
If you need to go out,

00:14:40.497 --> 00:14:41.937
please be careful.

00:14:43.416 --> 00:14:44.575
Go and come back quickly.

00:14:44.576 --> 00:14:46.057
I'll wait for you here.

00:14:46.257 --> 00:14:47.376
We'll bring back

00:14:47.377 --> 00:14:48.537
the dragon pearl.

00:14:59.656 --> 00:15:00.776
Chu Moshang,

00:15:01.977 --> 00:15:03.417
do you think the sanctuary

00:15:03.737 --> 00:15:05.256
will believe us?
