00:01:27.705 --> 00:01:31.025
ADAPTED FROM THE NOVEL "MY QUEEN"
BY XIE LOUNAN

00:01:35.585 --> 00:01:36.585
Zhong Lin…

00:01:39.025 --> 00:01:40.025
Right now,

00:01:41.505 --> 00:01:42.665
you're all I have left.

00:01:43.345 --> 00:01:44.665
Silly guy,

00:01:46.705 --> 00:01:48.265
you still have His Majesty besides me.

00:01:48.905 --> 00:01:50.505
He treats you like his own sibling.

00:01:50.585 --> 00:01:51.825
-Of course he…
-Enough.

00:01:53.425 --> 00:01:56.945
My mother and Ying
were killed by his own hands.

00:01:59.505 --> 00:02:03.225
You're saying the Empress Dowager and
the Princess died by His Majesty's hand?

00:02:05.105 --> 00:02:07.865
That's impossible.
He's not that kind of man.

00:02:09.625 --> 00:02:10.785
There must be some mistake.

00:02:11.625 --> 00:02:14.425
I saw it with my own eyes.
How could there be any mistake?

00:02:15.745 --> 00:02:16.945
What I hate is,

00:02:17.865 --> 00:02:19.865
I treated Xiao Huan like a brother,

00:02:20.705 --> 00:02:22.385
but he was never truly sincere with me.

00:02:23.145 --> 00:02:25.345
No, that can't be.

00:02:25.985 --> 00:02:27.985
His Majesty may be deep and hard to read,

00:02:28.065 --> 00:02:29.705
but he's someone
who values love and loyalty.

00:02:29.785 --> 00:02:31.545
I can see he's sincere toward you.

00:02:31.625 --> 00:02:33.225
Besides, there's still Cangcang.

00:02:33.305 --> 00:02:35.825
-She would never allow that…
-Are you speaking up for them now?

00:02:36.425 --> 00:02:38.505
You said you'd always stay by my side.

00:02:39.025 --> 00:02:40.465
It was all a lie!

00:02:42.105 --> 00:02:43.105
Just go.

00:02:43.705 --> 00:02:45.665
No, that's not what I meant…

00:02:50.385 --> 00:02:51.705
What's wrong with you?

00:02:51.785 --> 00:02:53.265
Are you hiding something from me?

00:02:53.345 --> 00:02:55.385
I told you to leave! Can't you understand?

00:03:08.385 --> 00:03:10.145
I don't want to see you right now.

00:03:32.105 --> 00:03:33.065
Fine…

00:03:34.825 --> 00:03:35.705
I'll go.

00:03:51.105 --> 00:03:52.825
Then take good care of yourself.

00:04:20.985 --> 00:04:22.945
Your Highness, what a temper.

00:04:23.705 --> 00:04:26.105
You just chased
Princess Zhong Lin away like that.

00:04:27.865 --> 00:04:29.505
Aren't you afraid you'll hurt her?

00:04:30.425 --> 00:04:31.345
What,

00:04:32.985 --> 00:04:34.945
even my private affairs

00:04:35.585 --> 00:04:37.265
need you to meddle in them?

00:04:38.985 --> 00:04:39.945
I wouldn't dare.

00:04:41.145 --> 00:04:44.945
But Princess Zhong Lin
is the Empress's most trusted friend.

00:04:46.465 --> 00:04:48.585
If you let me have
someone keep an eye on her,

00:04:48.665 --> 00:04:50.145
maybe

00:04:50.905 --> 00:04:52.385
we'll learn where Her Majesty is.

00:05:01.025 --> 00:05:02.025
Preceptor Du,

00:05:02.905 --> 00:05:06.505
I'll remind you once more:
you're overstepping.

00:05:11.985 --> 00:05:13.465
I've thought it through.

00:05:15.265 --> 00:05:17.065
I want the throne,

00:05:17.985 --> 00:05:20.705
and I want to take
everything from Xiao Huan.

00:05:22.825 --> 00:05:24.945
Until I achieve that,

00:05:26.305 --> 00:05:29.065
Preceptor Du,
you are not to interfere with me.

00:05:30.865 --> 00:05:32.545
You don't trust me?

00:05:36.065 --> 00:05:39.145
And do you trust me?

00:05:40.465 --> 00:05:42.865
You and I are merely using each other.

00:05:42.945 --> 00:05:46.385
But do me a favor, don't anger me,

00:05:46.905 --> 00:05:49.385
or I might turn on you.

00:05:50.785 --> 00:05:54.945
Your Highness's temper
is still as reckless and rash as ever.

00:05:56.425 --> 00:05:58.585
I only wanted to remind you

00:05:59.185 --> 00:06:02.825
that Princess Zhong Lin is the key.

00:06:03.745 --> 00:06:06.105
I'll give you one last warning.

00:06:07.505 --> 00:06:08.985
She's mine.

00:06:10.225 --> 00:06:11.425
I don't need your help with her.

00:06:11.505 --> 00:06:12.345
Good.

00:06:12.985 --> 00:06:17.025
Otherwise,
if Princess Zhong Lin acts rashly,

00:06:18.545 --> 00:06:20.665
even you won't be able to protect her.

00:06:50.585 --> 00:06:52.105
Are you speaking up for them now?

00:06:52.625 --> 00:06:54.585
You said you'd always stay by my side.

00:06:55.105 --> 00:06:56.425
It was all a lie!

00:06:57.025 --> 00:06:58.025
Are you hiding something from me?

00:06:58.105 --> 00:06:59.825
I told you to leave! Can't you understand?

00:07:02.305 --> 00:07:04.585
What on earth are you hiding from me?

00:07:05.505 --> 00:07:07.625
Did something happen to
His Majesty and Cangcang?

00:07:09.185 --> 00:07:10.585
Xiao Qianqing,

00:07:10.665 --> 00:07:13.065
don't stray from the right path

00:07:13.145 --> 00:07:15.345
and do something you'll regret.

00:07:31.505 --> 00:07:32.945
Talk. Who sent you?

00:07:36.985 --> 00:07:38.025
Are you with the Prince of Yuzhang?

00:07:47.545 --> 00:07:51.625
{\an8}QINGLIN COURT

00:07:52.585 --> 00:07:53.425
Your Highness.

00:07:57.785 --> 00:07:59.665
You were sent by Prince of Yuzhang too?

00:07:59.745 --> 00:08:01.625
His Highness is worried about your safety.

00:08:02.865 --> 00:08:04.945
He even sent more
men to keep an eye on me.

00:08:05.985 --> 00:08:08.985
Xiao Qianqing,
what exactly are you trying to do?

00:08:10.105 --> 00:08:13.105
QINGLIN COURT

00:08:32.465 --> 00:08:34.024
The Prince ordered you to watch me.

00:08:34.105 --> 00:08:37.664
Did he also tell you to watch me sleep?
I'm tired now, so hurry up and get lost!

00:08:50.905 --> 00:08:51.865
Cangcang!

00:08:52.545 --> 00:08:53.625
Keep your voice down.

00:09:00.825 --> 00:09:02.745
Cangcang, promise me.

00:09:03.665 --> 00:09:05.425
No matter what happens,

00:09:05.505 --> 00:09:07.505
as soon as you see the warning arrow fly,

00:09:07.585 --> 00:09:09.265
you must put your own safety first.

00:09:09.345 --> 00:09:11.225
This is bad.
Something's happened in the palace.

00:09:29.025 --> 00:09:30.225
Xiaolan.

00:09:30.305 --> 00:09:31.545
Your Highness, I'm here.

00:09:31.625 --> 00:09:33.505
Get some hot water ready.
I need a medicinal bath!

00:09:41.505 --> 00:09:42.545
Cangcang.

00:09:45.305 --> 00:09:46.345
Go ahead.

00:09:48.985 --> 00:09:50.185
Hang in there.

00:10:20.305 --> 00:10:21.185
Does it hurt?

00:10:28.585 --> 00:10:30.945
Xiaolan. Why is this water so cold?

00:10:33.585 --> 00:10:34.905
Yes, Your Highness.

00:10:35.425 --> 00:10:37.665
I'll go get you hot water right away!

00:10:38.665 --> 00:10:39.625
Xiaolan is from Fenglai Pavilion.

00:10:39.705 --> 00:10:40.745
Don't worry.

00:10:43.185 --> 00:10:44.585
What on earth is happening in the palace?

00:11:15.785 --> 00:11:17.265
Why is he here?

00:11:19.585 --> 00:11:20.745
Prince of Yuzhang?

00:11:21.265 --> 00:11:22.105
What…

00:11:22.185 --> 00:11:23.625
what is going on?

00:11:24.585 --> 00:11:25.425
Where is His Majesty?

00:11:25.505 --> 00:11:26.985
What is this supposed to mean?

00:11:39.345 --> 00:11:40.985
His Majesty was
suddenly taken ill with a cold.

00:11:41.585 --> 00:11:42.425
He is now bedridden.

00:11:43.465 --> 00:11:44.865
The imperial
physicians have been summoned,

00:11:45.465 --> 00:11:47.025
and he has been
moved to the retreat to recover.

00:11:47.625 --> 00:11:48.825
During this time,

00:11:48.905 --> 00:11:50.585
all state affairs

00:11:51.105 --> 00:11:52.185
will be handled by me.

00:11:58.385 --> 00:11:59.465
Your Highness,

00:11:59.545 --> 00:12:02.785
do you have an imperial edict or
at least His Majesty's word on this?

00:12:03.745 --> 00:12:05.505
His Majesty fell ill so suddenly.

00:12:05.585 --> 00:12:08.145
We wish to see Her Majesty

00:12:08.225 --> 00:12:11.465
to show our concern.

00:12:12.065 --> 00:12:14.985
Seeing how suddenly His Majesty fell ill,

00:12:15.065 --> 00:12:17.545
Her Majesty panicked,
worried herself too much,

00:12:17.625 --> 00:12:18.825
and fell ill herself.

00:12:19.345 --> 00:12:22.025
She has gone with
His Majesty to the retreat.

00:12:22.105 --> 00:12:25.545
How can you officials
just see her whenever you like?

00:12:27.865 --> 00:12:30.185
Mr. Lin, do you not trust me?

00:12:31.865 --> 00:12:35.145
I'm only worried
about His Majesty's health.

00:12:41.865 --> 00:12:44.505
We respectfully ask Your Highness
to govern on His Majesty's behalf!

00:12:44.585 --> 00:12:47.905
We respectfully ask Your Highness
to govern on His Majesty's behalf!

00:12:53.865 --> 00:12:56.585
We respectfully ask Your Highness
to govern on His Majesty's behalf!

00:12:56.665 --> 00:12:59.385
We respectfully ask Your Highness
to govern on His Majesty's behalf!

00:12:59.465 --> 00:13:01.425
Sharing His Majesty's burdens

00:13:01.505 --> 00:13:03.945
is only what I ought to do.

00:13:29.025 --> 00:13:30.465
By His Majesty's decree:

00:13:31.065 --> 00:13:32.425
His Majesty is unwell

00:13:32.505 --> 00:13:35.305
and has gone with
Her Majesty to recover at the retreat.

00:13:35.905 --> 00:13:37.385
Linghe Hall is sealed.

00:13:37.465 --> 00:13:40.465
No one is allowed to
leave the hall without cause.

00:13:40.545 --> 00:13:42.105
Await further orders.

00:13:42.905 --> 00:13:43.905
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:14:48.465 --> 00:14:49.465
Madam?

00:14:53.865 --> 00:14:55.825
-Madam?
-What's going on…

00:14:56.705 --> 00:14:57.865
with His Majesty?

00:14:59.625 --> 00:15:02.785
Aside from letting
Eunuch Feng serve him up close,

00:15:03.305 --> 00:15:05.185
he won't say a word

00:15:06.305 --> 00:15:09.185
about the Empress's whereabouts
and where the Imperial Seal is.

00:15:09.905 --> 00:15:11.225
Nothing at all.

00:15:14.465 --> 00:15:16.065
He's already my prisoner,

00:15:16.145 --> 00:15:18.105
so why does he still
act so high and mighty?

00:15:18.625 --> 00:15:20.625
He won't even beg for mercy once.

00:15:20.705 --> 00:15:22.545
Does he really think
that stubborn backbone of his

00:15:22.625 --> 00:15:24.105
leaves me helpless?

00:15:24.705 --> 00:15:25.665
Madam…

00:15:27.785 --> 00:15:29.825
ordinary methods

00:15:30.705 --> 00:15:32.825
probably won't work on him anymore.

00:15:35.985 --> 00:15:37.545
Trouble grows with time.

00:15:38.305 --> 00:15:39.505
We might as well

00:15:41.105 --> 00:15:43.025
let the Lingbi Sect make a move.

00:15:44.985 --> 00:15:48.425
They have plenty of ways
to make people wish they were dead.

00:15:49.025 --> 00:15:50.905
They can definitely force
him to hand over the Imperial Seal

00:15:51.425 --> 00:15:53.385
and write an edict to pass on the throne.

00:16:11.185 --> 00:16:12.185
All right…

00:16:15.305 --> 00:16:17.305
You left me no choice.

00:16:20.585 --> 00:16:22.505
Today, Xiao Qianqing
took the throne to act as regent.

00:16:22.585 --> 00:16:24.145
His Majesty still hasn't appeared.

00:16:25.545 --> 00:16:27.385
Cangcang, what are we going to do?

00:16:27.945 --> 00:16:29.905
Princess Ying and
the Empress Dowager's deaths

00:16:29.985 --> 00:16:31.265
shattered Xiao Qianqing.

00:16:31.785 --> 00:16:33.625
He wouldn't really
team up with Du Tingxin…

00:16:36.505 --> 00:16:38.105
I have to see Xiao Huan.

00:16:38.185 --> 00:16:39.265
Don't panic, Cangcang.

00:16:39.345 --> 00:16:41.905
You're badly hurt. Heal up first.

00:16:41.985 --> 00:16:42.985
I'll make inquiries for you.

00:17:00.185 --> 00:17:03.345
So you're the one behind Du Tingxin.

00:17:51.745 --> 00:17:52.825
Saintess?

00:17:53.425 --> 00:17:54.785
I thought you took
orders from the Ghost King.

00:17:55.825 --> 00:17:56.945
The Ghost King?

00:17:57.025 --> 00:17:58.825
Trying to pry words out of me?

00:18:02.465 --> 00:18:05.625
DRAGON–PHOENIX BLESSINGS

00:18:10.745 --> 00:18:11.705
Cangcang,

00:18:12.345 --> 00:18:15.225
you're still wounded.
You must take care of yourself.

00:18:15.305 --> 00:18:17.185
Only once you've
recovered can you save His Majesty.

00:18:21.425 --> 00:18:22.345
Zhong Lin,

00:18:22.865 --> 00:18:24.985
I'm lucky to have you. Thank you.

00:18:25.865 --> 00:18:27.265
Come on, what are friends for?

00:18:27.785 --> 00:18:30.505
If you're in trouble,
I would never just stand by.

00:18:34.825 --> 00:18:36.305
But with how things are now,

00:18:37.185 --> 00:18:38.305
even I don't see any chance of winning.

00:18:40.145 --> 00:18:42.985
You've already helped me enough.
Let it stop here.

00:18:46.665 --> 00:18:48.145
What if…

00:18:49.865 --> 00:18:51.625
I can get you in to see His Majesty?

00:18:54.625 --> 00:18:55.705
You know where he is?

00:18:58.105 --> 00:18:59.025
The Hot Spring Retreat.

00:18:59.665 --> 00:19:00.865
The Hot Spring Retreat?

00:19:04.505 --> 00:19:06.025
I'm afraid Du Tingxin

00:19:06.905 --> 00:19:08.385
has already laid a trap there.

00:19:10.465 --> 00:19:11.305
I'll help you.

00:19:14.545 --> 00:19:15.785
Then you must remember:

00:19:15.865 --> 00:19:18.305
when you're dealing with Du Tingxin,
you must not be reckless.

00:19:18.385 --> 00:19:20.905
-Be careful with everything!
-You too.

00:19:20.985 --> 00:19:23.505
If you really see His Majesty,
don't lose your head.

00:19:24.065 --> 00:19:26.385
Wait until
reinforcements arrive before you act.

00:19:26.465 --> 00:19:28.545
His safety is still in their hands.

00:19:28.625 --> 00:19:29.905
I won't take any reckless risks.

00:19:30.585 --> 00:19:31.985
I can't stay out for too long.

00:19:32.505 --> 00:19:33.945
Someone will come for you soon.

00:19:34.025 --> 00:19:36.065
-Be careful in all things.
-All right. You too.

00:19:44.105 --> 00:19:45.105
Bai,

00:19:46.225 --> 00:19:47.385
are you all right?

00:20:15.465 --> 00:20:16.905
Saintess, the stone man lost.

00:20:17.665 --> 00:20:19.865
I underestimated him.

00:20:33.625 --> 00:20:35.945
Your Majesty… what happened?

00:20:36.025 --> 00:20:37.385
-Someone tried to assassinate you?
-I'm fine.

00:20:38.305 --> 00:20:41.145
Du Tingxin might've joined forces
with the Saintess of the Lingbi Sect.

00:20:41.225 --> 00:20:43.745
Their tricks truly are strange,
and their methods vicious.

00:20:47.665 --> 00:20:49.025
Your Majesty, then…

00:20:49.625 --> 00:20:52.745
you should leave this
dangerous place at once.

00:21:09.985 --> 00:21:10.945
Hear me out first.

00:21:11.465 --> 00:21:14.465
I suspect the one behind all this
is Du Tingxin herself.

00:21:15.305 --> 00:21:16.665
If I'm right,

00:21:16.745 --> 00:21:19.025
she's already preparing a palace coup.

00:21:19.105 --> 00:21:21.705
When that happens, she'll try every way
she can to win you over

00:21:21.785 --> 00:21:23.785
and make you her puppet emperor.

00:21:23.865 --> 00:21:25.305
If I turn out to be right,

00:21:25.385 --> 00:21:26.425
remember this:

00:21:26.505 --> 00:21:29.425
you must not refuse her.
You have to pretend to work with her.

00:21:29.505 --> 00:21:33.065
On her own,
she could never pull off a coup.

00:21:33.665 --> 00:21:37.785
Only by stalling for time
can we discover who's really behind her.

00:21:38.425 --> 00:21:42.625
Only by ripping them out root and branch
can Great Qi know lasting peace.

00:22:16.585 --> 00:22:17.425
This aroma is…

00:22:19.665 --> 00:22:20.625
Naiguo tea.

00:22:31.785 --> 00:22:33.225
Perfect timing.

00:22:39.905 --> 00:22:40.945
Have a taste.

00:22:53.305 --> 00:22:54.145
Delicious!

00:23:00.425 --> 00:23:01.625
Add two more dates.

00:23:23.305 --> 00:23:25.265
You haven't slept in days, have you?

00:23:29.265 --> 00:23:30.385
Get some sleep.

00:23:31.905 --> 00:23:32.745
Zhong Lin…

00:23:35.505 --> 00:23:36.985
I… I'm afraid to sleep.

00:23:41.425 --> 00:23:43.025
Whenever I close my eyes,

00:23:44.305 --> 00:23:45.785
I see Ying.

00:23:48.185 --> 00:23:50.105
She tugs at my sleeve,

00:23:51.385 --> 00:23:53.145
this tiny little thing

00:23:54.385 --> 00:23:56.185
following me everywhere.

00:23:58.265 --> 00:23:59.505
In the blink of an eye,

00:24:00.945 --> 00:24:04.105
she's grown into a graceful young lady.

00:24:08.145 --> 00:24:10.825
But suddenly she's lying in a coffin.

00:24:13.305 --> 00:24:15.465
No matter how I shout,

00:24:16.185 --> 00:24:17.145
how I call her name,

00:24:19.145 --> 00:24:20.745
she never answers me.

00:24:25.345 --> 00:24:26.665
Just a few days ago,

00:24:27.905 --> 00:24:29.545
she said once we left the palace,

00:24:30.425 --> 00:24:31.665
we'd go see the sea of flowers.

00:24:33.625 --> 00:24:34.585
She said

00:24:35.665 --> 00:24:38.145
she'd grow up sensible and well-read,

00:24:40.025 --> 00:24:42.105
learn to be dutiful and considerate.

00:24:43.625 --> 00:24:44.825
She even said

00:24:46.065 --> 00:24:47.385
she'd see me off at the end of my days.

00:25:00.945 --> 00:25:01.945
Zhong Lin,

00:25:03.665 --> 00:25:05.545
do you think one day

00:25:07.345 --> 00:25:08.545
you'll leave me too?

00:25:14.385 --> 00:25:15.665
I won't.

00:25:32.185 --> 00:25:34.225
All right, stop thinking about it.

00:25:34.945 --> 00:25:36.345
Close your eyes

00:25:37.425 --> 00:25:38.585
and get some sleep.

00:26:19.025 --> 00:26:20.265
Xiao Qianqing?

00:26:23.865 --> 00:26:24.945
Xiao Qianqing?

00:26:52.665 --> 00:26:54.425
{\an8}XIAO QIANQING

00:27:09.105 --> 00:27:10.945
If you want to be mad at me,

00:27:11.545 --> 00:27:12.785
then be mad.

00:27:14.225 --> 00:27:15.625
But being angry for a while

00:27:16.265 --> 00:27:18.465
is better than regretting it later.

00:27:19.745 --> 00:27:21.105
Don't you think?

00:28:20.945 --> 00:28:22.345
At noon today,

00:28:22.425 --> 00:28:24.305
Du Tingxin is to visit
Prince of Yuzhang's Manor.

00:28:24.385 --> 00:28:26.145
You can check
the East Hall of the Hot Spring Retreat.

00:28:34.385 --> 00:28:39.345
PRINCE OF YUZHANG'S MANOR

00:28:46.585 --> 00:28:47.905
Is His Highness in?

00:28:47.985 --> 00:28:49.905
His Highness is not in,
but Princess Zhong Lin is.

00:28:50.505 --> 00:28:51.825
Madam, please.

00:29:10.825 --> 00:29:12.025
Preceptor Du.

00:29:14.665 --> 00:29:16.545
His Highness suddenly
had urgent business at the palace

00:29:17.065 --> 00:29:18.425
and ordered me to wait here for you.

00:29:20.745 --> 00:29:23.305
Please sit and wait a while.

00:29:49.105 --> 00:29:53.105
I've long heard
that you're unrivaled in tea and incense.

00:29:54.105 --> 00:29:54.945
I wonder

00:29:55.705 --> 00:29:57.705
if this Yunwuqing tea today

00:29:59.105 --> 00:30:00.825
suits your taste.

00:31:34.825 --> 00:31:37.225
Since His Highness is busy,
I'll see him another time then.

00:31:37.825 --> 00:31:39.745
His Highness does have
matters to discuss with you.

00:31:39.825 --> 00:31:41.345
Then I'll go into
the palace to see him myself.

00:31:41.865 --> 00:31:43.065
No need for that.

00:31:44.625 --> 00:31:45.585
What?

00:31:48.385 --> 00:31:50.065
I'm actually the one
who wanted to see you.

00:31:52.745 --> 00:31:55.345
Why would we need to meet?

00:31:59.025 --> 00:32:00.705
His Highness and I are already engaged.

00:32:01.225 --> 00:32:03.625
I wanted to see you
of course because of him.

00:32:04.225 --> 00:32:06.745
Then why go around him to come to me,

00:32:07.265 --> 00:32:10.185
even going so far as to steal
his seal and stamp it in secret?

00:32:12.385 --> 00:32:14.065
His Highness is keeping secrets with you,

00:32:14.665 --> 00:32:16.225
yet won't tell me.

00:32:17.265 --> 00:32:18.865
It worries me.

00:32:19.705 --> 00:32:21.385
You're a woman too.

00:32:21.465 --> 00:32:23.185
You should understand

00:32:23.265 --> 00:32:25.945
there are some things
you have to see with your own eyes

00:32:26.025 --> 00:32:26.905
before you can be at ease.

00:32:33.905 --> 00:32:35.305
Our Princess Zhong Lin

00:32:35.385 --> 00:32:37.625
really is wholeheartedly
devoted to His Highness.

00:32:38.425 --> 00:32:39.985
Hearing you say that,

00:32:41.185 --> 00:32:43.465
I'm almost a little envious of him.

00:32:46.105 --> 00:32:49.625
If you had to choose
between His Highness and Ling Cangcang,

00:32:49.705 --> 00:32:50.545
Your Highness,

00:32:51.185 --> 00:32:52.425
who would you choose?

00:32:58.945 --> 00:33:00.025
Do you know

00:33:01.345 --> 00:33:04.945
what kind of lonely, desperate situation
His Highness is in right now?

00:33:05.785 --> 00:33:07.545
If he's deceived again,

00:33:08.145 --> 00:33:10.385
how much more would he suffer?

00:33:19.305 --> 00:33:23.425
My feelings for His Highness are love,
and Cangcang and I are like sisters.

00:33:24.345 --> 00:33:26.105
Mind your words, Preceptor Du.

00:33:26.185 --> 00:33:27.505
That's not something
I have to choose between.

00:33:29.745 --> 00:33:31.505
I see.

00:33:42.425 --> 00:33:46.065
Since you won't say anything,
then forget it.

00:33:46.145 --> 00:33:47.265
You may go, Preceptor Du.

00:33:47.345 --> 00:33:49.185
Don't think that with a few tricks,

00:33:49.705 --> 00:33:52.065
Ling Cangcang will get to see him.

00:33:57.625 --> 00:33:59.305
What do you mean by that, Preceptor Du?

00:35:00.865 --> 00:35:01.705
You search over there.

00:35:01.785 --> 00:35:03.665
-Everyone else, come with me!
-Yes, sir!

00:35:18.345 --> 00:35:19.265
Zhong Lin,

00:35:19.345 --> 00:35:21.025
do you know what you're doing?

00:35:22.305 --> 00:35:23.185
Looks like

00:35:23.785 --> 00:35:24.745
this letter

00:35:25.345 --> 00:35:27.265
wasn't really Your Highness's intention.

00:35:43.025 --> 00:35:45.785
You swear up and down you won't leave me,

00:35:46.985 --> 00:35:50.345
yet you steal my seal
and scheme behind my back!

00:35:55.265 --> 00:35:57.145
-We'll talk later.
-Save it!

00:35:58.785 --> 00:36:01.545
So you were lying to me, coaxing me,

00:36:02.385 --> 00:36:04.105
and betraying me all the same.

00:36:04.185 --> 00:36:07.065
I've had enough of that.

00:36:10.265 --> 00:36:12.025
You've misunderstood me.
That's not what I meant.

00:36:12.105 --> 00:36:12.945
Then what did you mean?

00:36:13.025 --> 00:36:15.985
Isn't this fake letter proof enough
that you betrayed me?

00:36:16.065 --> 00:36:18.225
I didn't betray you! I…

00:36:24.625 --> 00:36:25.545
Fine.

00:36:26.225 --> 00:36:27.825
So you believe her, not me?

00:36:32.025 --> 00:36:32.945
Guards!

00:36:33.025 --> 00:36:34.145
Your Highness.

00:36:35.345 --> 00:36:36.865
Take her back to her room.

00:36:36.945 --> 00:36:40.185
Without my permission,
she's not to take a single step outside.

00:36:40.265 --> 00:36:41.105
Yes, Your Highness.

00:36:49.585 --> 00:36:51.105
Now that Your Highness has returned,

00:36:51.185 --> 00:36:53.985
you must know
this was just a ploy to lure you away.

00:36:56.265 --> 00:36:58.825
I'll go with you to the retreat right now.

00:37:00.225 --> 00:37:04.665
What, for something this minor,
Your Highness still doesn't trust me?

00:37:07.185 --> 00:37:10.105
Today I've tasted betrayal to the fullest.

00:37:10.785 --> 00:37:13.825
I owe all of this
entirely to my imperial brother.

00:37:14.425 --> 00:37:17.345
I will make sure he pays me back double.

00:37:18.385 --> 00:37:21.185
LINGQUAN PALACE

00:37:53.905 --> 00:37:56.825
It's been days, and I finally get to
see you, Prince of Yuzhang.

00:38:01.505 --> 00:38:03.265
Why did you put that thing on him?

00:38:03.905 --> 00:38:05.225
Are you asking me?

00:38:05.305 --> 00:38:06.345
Yes!

00:38:06.425 --> 00:38:08.545
I'm asking you. Why did you put
something like that on him?

00:38:08.625 --> 00:38:09.905
So what if I did?

00:38:17.945 --> 00:38:19.225
I even want to kill him.

00:38:19.985 --> 00:38:21.625
Didn't Your Highness promise me

00:38:21.705 --> 00:38:25.425
that how to deal with him
would be entirely up to me?

00:38:25.505 --> 00:38:27.265
However you want to
torment him to vent your anger,

00:38:27.345 --> 00:38:28.225
I won't interfere.

00:38:29.185 --> 00:38:31.625
But this thing… no.

00:38:32.145 --> 00:38:32.985
Take it off him.

00:38:38.065 --> 00:38:39.625
If not for this iron chain

00:38:39.705 --> 00:38:42.185
that even blades can't cut,

00:38:42.265 --> 00:38:45.025
our emperor would've escaped already.

00:38:45.625 --> 00:38:47.425
Your Highness, have you gone soft?

00:38:47.505 --> 00:38:49.745
So you've forgiven His Majesty so soon?

00:38:51.305 --> 00:38:54.625
I only want him to
taste betrayal to the fullest.

00:38:54.705 --> 00:38:56.105
But no matter what he's done,

00:38:56.785 --> 00:38:58.905
he's still of the imperial bloodline.

00:38:58.985 --> 00:39:00.105
The dignity of the imperial house

00:39:01.105 --> 00:39:03.025
is not yours to trample.

00:39:03.745 --> 00:39:05.145
This is where I draw the line.

00:39:11.585 --> 00:39:14.145
It seems Your Highness
only acts on emotion

00:39:14.985 --> 00:39:18.065
and has no real
ambition or resolve for great deeds.

00:39:20.545 --> 00:39:22.305
I misjudged you.

00:39:23.585 --> 00:39:24.905
Xiao Qianqing,

00:39:26.145 --> 00:39:28.385
my throne can be yours.

00:39:35.065 --> 00:39:36.105
What did you say?

00:39:36.185 --> 00:39:38.185
If I swore

00:39:38.705 --> 00:39:41.785
that I absolutely did not kill Xiao Ying,
would you believe me?

00:39:51.385 --> 00:39:52.225
No.

00:39:58.465 --> 00:40:00.465
You can have my throne,

00:40:01.105 --> 00:40:02.225
but I have one condition.

00:40:04.745 --> 00:40:05.945
Your Highness must not listen to him!

00:40:07.065 --> 00:40:08.385
What condition?

00:40:09.145 --> 00:40:11.465
I want to die with dignity.

00:40:11.545 --> 00:40:12.385
Your Highness…

00:40:12.465 --> 00:40:13.345
Silence!

00:40:20.425 --> 00:40:23.025
If you still remember
I was once your elder brother,

00:40:23.105 --> 00:40:25.665
then on the Empress Dowager's funeral day,

00:40:25.745 --> 00:40:27.025
let me die with dignity

00:40:27.545 --> 00:40:28.465
on Phoenix Terrace.

00:40:41.105 --> 00:40:42.305
His Majesty has already been moved

00:40:42.385 --> 00:40:43.625
from the Hot Spring Retreat
back to the palace.

00:40:43.705 --> 00:40:46.105
They say he'll attend
the Empress Dowager's grand funeral rites.

00:40:46.185 --> 00:40:47.025
DRAGON–PHOENIX BLESSINGS

00:40:48.945 --> 00:40:49.785
Miss Zhong.

00:40:50.305 --> 00:40:52.145
-Miss Zhong.
-Miss Zhong.

00:40:52.665 --> 00:40:54.465
Zhong Lin, are you all right?

00:40:54.545 --> 00:40:56.625
I'm late, Miss Ling. It took me some time
to shake the people tailing me.

00:40:56.705 --> 00:40:58.265
As long as you're safe. Sit.

00:40:58.345 --> 00:40:59.505
Everyone, sit.

00:41:01.745 --> 00:41:04.025
Now that I've gathered you all here,

00:41:04.105 --> 00:41:05.545
I'm sure you know why.

00:41:05.625 --> 00:41:07.785
The Capital is in turmoil.

00:41:07.865 --> 00:41:10.825
Fenglai Pavilion
must share His Majesty's burdens

00:41:10.905 --> 00:41:12.425
and stand with
Great Qi through this crisis.

00:41:12.505 --> 00:41:13.745
Yes!

00:41:14.545 --> 00:41:17.225
In my letter I've instructed Shi Yan
that within five days,

00:41:17.305 --> 00:41:19.345
he is to lead our followers from
all branches in a coordinated strike.

00:41:19.425 --> 00:41:20.505
When the time comes,

00:41:20.585 --> 00:41:22.865
I'll need you all waiting outside the city
to help him slip into the Capital.

00:41:24.185 --> 00:41:25.025
Yes!

00:41:25.105 --> 00:41:26.305
Thank you.

00:41:36.625 --> 00:41:38.225
You left the Imperial Seal with me

00:41:38.905 --> 00:41:41.225
because you already foresaw all this?

00:41:59.265 --> 00:42:01.345
{\an8}SPIRIT TABLET OF
EMPRESS DOWAGER LIU OF GREAT QI

00:42:17.665 --> 00:42:19.145
Seal the coffin!

00:42:44.345 --> 00:42:45.585
Kneel!

00:42:52.545 --> 00:42:54.345
Bow!

00:42:58.025 --> 00:42:59.785
Rise!

00:43:03.105 --> 00:43:04.825
Bow again!

00:43:08.305 --> 00:43:09.865
Rise!

00:43:13.825 --> 00:43:15.385
You may stand!
