Please don't say that, Mr. Gao.

I've been in Macao, China

Hi.

00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:40.500
I'm the one who called.

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:42.810
My surname is Wang.

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:44.020
Just call me Wang.

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:47.140
You posted online

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:48.690
looking for your father, right?

00:10:48.950 --> 00:10:49.380
Yes.

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:51.340
It's quite a coincidence.

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:52.410
A while back, I was on a business trip

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.260
and saw a homeless man.

00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:55.500
I thought

00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:58.220
his height and build
looked a lot like your father's.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.810
Most importantly, I heard the locals

00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:02.500
call him Tan.

00:11:02.830 --> 00:11:03.980
Tan

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:05.260
isn't a very common surname.

00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:06.860
So I thought

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:08.220
it was likely your father.

00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:09.690
That's why I called you.

00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:13.460
Where did you

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:14.140
see...

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:15.100
see my father?

00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:17.500
I...

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:18.980
Well, you see,

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:21.740
I noticed your post mentioned

00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:23.340
a reward, right?

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:26.220
Don't get me wrong.

00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:27.810
I really shouldn't

00:11:28.830 --> 00:11:30.100
take the money.

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:31.860
After all, it's a good deed.

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:33.140
But

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:34.650
my family is struggling.

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:36.260
My wife doesn't work,

00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:37.100
and my child is still young.

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:39.220
So I... I really need the money.

00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:42.860
So, could you give me the reward

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:43.980
first...?

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:45.860
Here's the thing, Mr. Wang.

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:47.860
I rushed over
as soon as I got your call.

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:49.340
I was in such a hurry.

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:51.570
I didn't bring much cash with me.

00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:54.100
But if the information you provide

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:55.340
confirms the man

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:56.570
is my father,

00:11:56.910 --> 00:11:58.570
I will definitely give you the reward.

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:03.620
Alright then.

00:12:03.830 --> 00:12:05.050
I... I'll trust you.

00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:08.020
So here's what happened.

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:09.100
I was on a business trip.

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:11.100
One day, I was eating out.

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:12.340
It was really cold that day.

00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:13.740
A little snowy too.

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:16.100
A homeless man came into the restaurant.

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:17.890
The staff tried to kick him out.

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:19.460
They said, "Tan,

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:19.810
I've told you

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:20.860
so many times

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:22.380
not to come here.
Why are you back again?"

00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:24.140
I thought he looked really pitiful.

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:25.500
He wasn't dressed warmly,

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:27.140
and his lips were purple from the cold.

00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:29.500
I figured I'd ordered
too much food anyway.

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:31.620
So I shared some of my meal with him.

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:33.690
We ate together

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:35.570
and chatted a bit.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.740
He said he'd been away from home
for a long time.

00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:39.980
He hadn't gone back.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:40.930
He missed home

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:42.620
and his daughter.

00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:46.500
You're his only daughter, right?

00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:47.980
Yes.

00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:50.860
Then he must have been talking
about you.

00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:52.050
Oh,

00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:55.260
and I noticed
he didn't seem to be in great shape.

00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:57.930
His mind wasn't very clear.

00:12:57.950 --> 00:12:59.340
He was limping when he walked.

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:01.810
I wondered if he'd gotten hurt

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.100
while he was out there.

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:05.810
So you really need to find him quickly.

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:08.690
Had he been drinking?

00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:10.220
He usually gets like that
after he drinks.

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:12.620
Right.

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:14.620
At first, he wasn't drinking.

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:15.930
But then, while eating,

00:13:15.950 --> 00:13:17.460
he wanted a drink.

00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:19.500
It was cold.

00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:21.380
So I bought him
a small bottle of baijiu.

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:22.740
But he didn't drink much.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.860
If I'd known he would get like that,

00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:25.810
I wouldn't have bought it for him.

00:13:25.830 --> 00:13:26.500
It's okay.

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:28.500
You meant well.

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:29.460
He

00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:30.810
has been like this for years.

00:13:30.830 --> 00:13:33.100
And when he drinks,
he always talks about my mom.

00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:37.140
Exactly.

00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:40.220
After a few drinks, he told me a lot.

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:42.980
Especially about your mother.

00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:46.460
Really.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.810
I felt so bad for him.

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:50.980
He said it's tough

00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:52.340
being out there alone.

00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:54.140
He missed home,

00:13:54.590 --> 00:13:55.690
his wife,

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:57.100
and his daughter. Really.

00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:58.930
I... I felt sorry for him.

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:00.100
Mr. Wang,

00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:02.620
well,

00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:06.570
thank you for all this information.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.740
But I have to say,

00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:10.930
the man you described
definitely isn't my father.

00:14:11.590 --> 00:14:13.620
Because my father never drinks.

00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:15.340
And my mother left

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:16.220
when I was very young.

00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:19.620
So I think

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:21.620
you should try someone else.

00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:24.380
What are you doing?

00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:24.860
What...

00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:25.860
What do you want?

00:14:26.590 --> 00:14:27.620
What do I want?

00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:29.340
Are you messing with me?

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:31.860
You knew I was making it up all along,

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:32.620
didn't you?

00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:34.500
Then why didn't you stop me sooner?

00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:36.810
You wasted my time!

00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:38.500
We're professionals, okay?

00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:40.340
We have daily quotas to meet!

00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:42.170
Fine.

00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:43.860
You like watching performances?

00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:46.020
I'll give you a show today.

00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:47.220
But one thing.

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:48.740
My acting doesn't come free.

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:51.500
Consider that money my performance fee.

00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:52.930
You're overthinking this, Mr. Wang.

00:14:52.950 --> 00:14:53.980
I've seen plenty of scammers!

00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:54.810
What are you doing?

00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:55.220
Give it to me!

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:56.290
Are you trying to steal from me?

00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:58.100
Let go!

00:14:58.120 --> 00:14:58.620
Stop!

00:14:58.880 --> 00:14:59.340
Stop it!

00:14:59.830 --> 00:15:00.500
Are you robbing?

00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:01.740
I'm recording this.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:02.740
I've got it all on video.

00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:03.980
Maybe you can

00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:04.860
perform for the police next.

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:05.570
Who are you?

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:06.930
You said you'd come alone.

00:15:06.950 --> 00:15:07.980
Breaking the rules, huh?

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:09.020
I've got it all recorded.

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:09.690
It's all recorded.

00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:10.810
You still won't leave?

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:13.460
Her fainting has nothing to do with me.

00:15:22.830 --> 00:15:23.570
Are you okay?

00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:26.050
Are you alright?

00:15:28.590 --> 00:15:29.260
Can you walk?

00:15:31.310 --> 00:15:31.810
Let me help you.

00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:34.220
Come on.

00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:36.890
Up.

00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:52.380
It's just a fever.

00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:57.980
Some fever reducer through an IV
should wake her up.

00:16:04.710 --> 00:16:05.100
Dad.

00:16:06.910 --> 00:16:07.220
Dad.

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:10.650
Dad.

00:16:17.550 --> 00:16:18.100
No.

00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:19.260
It's okay.

00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:21.100
Dad.

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:21.500
It's alright.

00:21:09.390 --> 00:21:10.130
Let's go, sir.

00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:42.260
Ms. Wen.

00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:44.900
There's something
I've been wanting to ask you.

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:46.180
Go ahead.

00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:47.420
What do you like about my dad?

00:21:52.550 --> 00:21:55.460
I like him

00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:57.610
because he's mature, steady,
and responsible.

00:21:59.350 --> 00:22:00.770
He really is too steady.

00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:02.460
Steady as a rock.

00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:05.260
He's so steady
that I've been feeling he's been

00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:06.500
a bit down lately.

00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:13.530
Maybe he's just busy with work.

00:22:13.550 --> 00:22:14.570
We should be understanding.

00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:16.570
I totally understand him.

00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:17.770
But don't worry.

00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:19.500
I've already talked to him.

00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:22.020
I told him not to walk around
with a long face every day.

00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:24.770
Feng Lexuan,

00:22:24.790 --> 00:22:26.660
you sure worry a lot, don't you?

00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:29.020
Alright. Go to bed now.

00:22:29.310 --> 00:22:29.810
Okay.

Why didn't you

00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:12.770
go to the bridal shop today?

00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:16.290
Something came up last minute.
So I went late.

00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:19.290
You know who I saw today?

00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:21.180
Who?

00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:23.220
Tan Siting.

00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:25.290
Is that so?

00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:29.570
Picking the venue,
choosing the wedding dress.

00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:31.740
She was there both times.

00:23:33.070 --> 00:23:34.460
Is she close to Yan?

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.260
Or is it because of you?

00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:39.050
Mom,

00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:41.020
they're colleagues.

00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:45.290
What a coincidence.

00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:51.020

It's been a while

Okay.

00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:47.610
Rui is back.

00:32:47.630 --> 00:32:48.180
Rui!

00:32:48.310 --> 00:32:48.900
You're back.

00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:49.370
Grandpa.

00:32:50.310 --> 00:32:51.500
I've missed you so much.

00:32:51.630 --> 00:32:51.900
Mom.

00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:52.980
Today

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:54.020
we specially prepared

00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:55.370
your favorite hometown dishes.

00:32:55.390 --> 00:32:56.050
Thank you, Grandpa.

00:32:56.350 --> 00:32:56.770
Feng Ming,

00:32:57.240 --> 00:32:58.700
have a good drink with your son.

00:32:58.720 --> 00:32:59.260
Okay.

00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:00.770
Where's Haotian?

00:33:01.390 --> 00:33:03.330
He knows you're back.
Said he'd come back for dinner.

00:33:03.550 --> 00:33:04.900
Maybe he's held up on the way.

00:33:06.110 --> 00:33:06.770
Let's start without him.

00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:09.810
Let's welcome Rui's triumphant return.

00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:10.610
Welcome home.

00:33:10.630 --> 00:33:11.220
Cheers.

00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:11.530
Here.

00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:12.570
Dad, a toast to you.

00:33:13.590 --> 00:33:14.290
You're toasting me?

00:33:14.310 --> 00:33:15.460
You can only toast me.

00:33:16.390 --> 00:33:16.700
Here.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:21.570
Rui,

00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:22.610
I read the quarterly report.

00:33:23.870 --> 00:33:24.530
Excellent.

00:33:25.310 --> 00:33:25.850
Really excellent.

00:33:26.590 --> 00:33:27.460
Your mom said

00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:29.130
you secured a deal

00:33:29.390 --> 00:33:31.260
with the largest distributor
in North China.

00:33:32.070 --> 00:33:32.500
Yes.

00:33:33.350 --> 00:33:34.850
That's truly remarkable, really.

00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:35.810
Grandpa.

00:33:35.830 --> 00:33:36.460
Actually,

00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:37.330
I've always had an idea.

00:33:37.830 --> 00:33:38.850
Instead of relying

00:33:39.590 --> 00:33:41.220
on foreign brands for distribution
in the long term,

00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:42.900
why don't we create

00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:43.980
our own brand

00:33:44.390 --> 00:33:45.330
and brew our own wine?

00:33:45.630 --> 00:33:46.290
So we could tap
into the domestic market...

00:33:46.310 --> 00:33:47.500
Why are you bringing this up again?

00:33:48.110 --> 00:33:50.020
The company is doing just fine as it is.

00:33:55.070 --> 00:33:55.460
Here.

00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:56.460
Eat.

00:33:56.590 --> 00:33:57.020
Dig in.

00:33:57.040 --> 00:33:57.530
Stop just talking.

00:33:57.550 --> 00:33:58.370
- This.
- Dad.

00:33:58.520 --> 00:33:59.700
You like this.

00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:00.610
You have it.

00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:03.260
Grandpa,

00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:04.180
Dad,

00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:04.700
Mom,

00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:08.130
I've been with the company
for over three years now.

00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:10.940
Everything I set out to do
has been accomplished.

00:34:11.110 --> 00:34:12.250
My mission is pretty much complete.

00:34:13.270 --> 00:34:14.050
So, I'd like to

00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:16.090
take a break
from the company for a while,

00:34:16.230 --> 00:34:18.170
then go back to school
for my master's degree.

00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:21.380
Rui,

00:34:22.710 --> 00:34:23.460
I know

00:34:24.070 --> 00:34:25.340
you've always dreamed
of working in aerospace.

00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:28.500
But the facts prove

00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:31.130
you have a real talent for business.

00:34:32.710 --> 00:34:34.820
The company
has just gotten back on its feet.

00:34:35.190 --> 00:34:36.170
If you leave now,

00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:37.500
who's going to help me?

00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:38.380
Rui,

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.170
I agree with your mom.

00:34:42.630 --> 00:34:43.380
Isn't Haotian

00:34:43.750 --> 00:34:44.250
still here?

00:34:51.190 --> 00:34:52.340
He's actually quite clever.

00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:54.170
If we put him in the company
to keep him busy,

00:34:54.550 --> 00:34:56.130
he won't have as much time
to go out and fool around.

00:34:56.230 --> 00:34:57.090
Absolutely not.

00:34:57.710 --> 00:35:00.170
He must never get involved
in the company's affairs.

00:35:00.550 --> 00:35:01.460
If he had any aptitude for it,

00:35:01.750 --> 00:35:03.130
you wouldn't have had to
wait until today.

00:35:03.670 --> 00:35:04.340
Rui!

00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:07.980
Why are you so late?

00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:09.530
You started eating without me?

00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:11.980
Have you lost weight?

00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:12.820
Of course.

00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:13.780
But

00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:15.690
you're looking more and more like a CEO.

00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:18.130
I told you to come back early.

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:20.900
Traffic jam?

00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:23.300
Yeah.

00:35:25.070 --> 00:35:25.650
It's fine.

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:26.940
We just sat down.

00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:28.020
Have a seat.

00:35:28.190 --> 00:35:28.690
Perfect timing.

00:35:29.710 --> 00:35:31.420
Dad, let's begin.

00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:32.340
Why are you back?

00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:34.570
Rui's back. I'm having dinner with him.

00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:36.820
You have the nerve
to sit at the same table as Rui?

00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:41.250
By family seniority, you're the elder.

00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:43.340
Rui is only a few months older than you.

00:35:43.630 --> 00:35:45.690
He works himself to the bone
for the company and this family.

00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:47.820
We won't even mention

00:35:48.270 --> 00:35:49.780
your usual shiftlessness and idleness.

00:35:50.550 --> 00:35:51.340
And now this.

00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:52.050
Come on.

00:35:52.270 --> 00:35:53.780
Tell Rui

00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:54.860
how much you lost gambling.

00:35:58.270 --> 00:35:58.610
Dad,

00:35:59.270 --> 00:36:00.090
don't be mad.

00:36:00.110 --> 00:36:00.980
Too ashamed to say it, huh?

00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:01.980
Dad,

00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:03.300
it was just a slip-up.

00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:06.650
Hui, I won't change my car next year.

00:36:06.670 --> 00:36:07.980
How dare you spend money?

00:36:08.190 --> 00:36:09.570
Did you earn this money yourself?

00:36:09.630 --> 00:36:10.570
You have the nerve.

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:12.210
If you were just a good-for-nothing,

00:36:12.230 --> 00:36:13.130
I wouldn't complain.

00:36:13.150 --> 00:36:14.250
But now you've taken up gambling.

00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:15.780
You should be kicked out of this family!

00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:16.690
Dad,

00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:18.420
you have high blood pressure.

00:36:19.270 --> 00:36:20.380
Don't get so mad.

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:22.610
Haotian,

00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:24.500
what you did was wrong.

00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:26.170
But...

00:36:26.190 --> 00:36:27.020
But what?

00:36:27.550 --> 00:36:28.380
I haven't even started on you yet.

00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:28.780
Eat up.

00:36:29.750 --> 00:36:31.460
He's this reckless

00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:32.690
because

00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:34.130
you're always cleaning up his mess.

00:36:34.670 --> 00:36:35.780
An elder sister is like a mother.

00:36:36.150 --> 00:36:37.690
You should've disciplined him properly.

00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:38.530
And what have you done?

00:36:41.630 --> 00:36:42.050
Grandpa,

00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:44.460
Haotian just likes trying new things.

00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:45.980
It was a momentary impulse.

00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:47.020
He won't gamble anymore.

00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:49.170
Dad,

00:36:49.670 --> 00:36:50.650
the mistake is already made.

00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:52.130
Don't scold me today.

00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:52.780
Exactly.

00:36:52.840 --> 00:36:54.420
Let's just have a pleasant meal.

00:36:54.590 --> 00:36:55.820
You good-for-nothing!

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:56.940
Our family has always been

00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:58.650
honest and hardworking.

00:36:58.710 --> 00:37:00.420
How did we end up
with a disgrace like you?

00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:02.900
Wipe that smirk off your face.

00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:04.130
Come over here

00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:05.300
and apologize to Dad right now.

00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:05.940
Yes, Grandpa.

00:37:06.150 --> 00:37:07.050
Haotian knows he was wrong.

00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:08.020
Please forgive him.

00:37:08.670 --> 00:37:11.530
We never should have let your mom
risk her life to have you.

00:37:11.750 --> 00:37:12.980
Get out of this house now!

00:37:13.070 --> 00:37:14.340
I'll just pretend I never had a son!

00:37:14.550 --> 00:37:14.980
Get out!

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:15.210
Grandpa.

00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:15.780
Dad.

00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:16.730
Calm down, Grandpa.

00:37:17.590 --> 00:37:18.090
Please calm down.

00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:19.020
He knows he was wrong.

00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:20.300
Grandpa.

00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:21.820
Haotian.

00:37:23.750 --> 00:37:24.170
What are you doing?

00:37:27.590 --> 00:37:28.500
Grandpa, calm down.

00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:43.340
Dad,

00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:46.300
why get so worked up?

00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:47.090
Haotian

00:37:47.230 --> 00:37:48.690
is still a child.

00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:50.170
He'll mature in a couple of years.

00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:52.610
Besides,

00:37:53.110 --> 00:37:54.300
he apologized.

00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:56.530
You have to give him a chance.

00:37:56.920 --> 00:37:58.420
Haotian was indeed wrong.

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:00.980
He should reflect properly

00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:02.020
and learn his lesson.

00:38:02.230 --> 00:38:04.130
Don't say anything
if you don't know what to say.

00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:05.500
Did Feng Ming say anything wrong?

00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:06.770
Why are you snapping at him?

00:38:07.150 --> 00:38:08.210
Haotian is my brother,

00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:09.770
the only son of our family,

00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:11.610
and the one my mother gave her life for!

00:38:13.590 --> 00:38:15.170
He doesn't need
any outsiders commenting.

00:38:26.110 --> 00:38:27.380
Our favorite spot.

00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:28.570
Where did you get this?

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:32.380
Haotian,

00:38:34.670 --> 00:38:35.980
I spoke with Grandpa the other day.

00:38:36.110 --> 00:38:38.130
Once the company stabilizes in a while,

00:38:38.630 --> 00:38:40.770
I want to go back to school
for my master's degree

00:38:41.190 --> 00:38:42.170
and hand the company over to you.

00:38:43.750 --> 00:38:45.340
You're not serious, are you?

00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:47.170
You know perfectly well.

00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:50.460
I didn't join the company willingly.

00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:52.090
I was forced by circumstances.

00:38:52.230 --> 00:38:53.340
Stop now.

00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:55.250
Look at me.

00:38:56.110 --> 00:38:57.290
You think I can take over the company?

00:38:57.630 --> 00:38:59.290
Even if you're okay with it,
I wouldn't trust myself.

00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:00.540
You

00:39:01.230 --> 00:39:02.650
keep being the general manager.

00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:04.730
Pay me for protection.

00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:05.770
I've got your back.

00:39:06.630 --> 00:39:08.170
I'm counting on you for my whole life.

00:39:16.710 --> 00:39:17.650
Do you remember

00:39:18.310 --> 00:39:19.060
when we were kids,

00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:20.770
we went to my dad's country home,

00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:24.940
- and stole someone else's watermelons!
- Watermelons!

00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:27.730
Later, the adults found out

00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:28.900
and demanded to know who did it.

00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:30.460
You told me not to say anything.

00:39:31.270 --> 00:39:32.940
You said it was all your idea.

00:39:35.880 --> 00:39:37.210
I still remember
when Grandpa was hitting you,

00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:38.650
you kept making faces at me.

00:39:42.230 --> 00:39:43.540
Actually, thinking back,
I really regret it.

00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:45.770
What is there to regret?

00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:47.170
Listening to me is never wrong.

00:39:48.190 --> 00:39:49.460
I wasn't afraid of my dad hitting me.

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:52.130
My sister would always protect me.

00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:57.170
I know,

00:39:58.310 --> 00:39:59.610
growing up, whenever we fought,

00:39:59.630 --> 00:40:01.060
your mom must have scolded you a lot.

00:40:03.310 --> 00:40:04.210
I wanted to ask you.

00:40:06.310 --> 00:40:07.460
Is it exhausting being the good kid?

00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:11.690
It's not about whether it's exhausting.

00:40:11.710 --> 00:40:12.420
I feel

00:40:13.310 --> 00:40:15.170
some responsibilities are mine to bear.

00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:18.290
I'm not saying

00:40:18.630 --> 00:40:19.900
I have a problem with my mom
always taking care of you.

00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:21.060
Forget it. Don't explain.

00:40:21.630 --> 00:40:23.170
It's always been like this.

00:40:23.190 --> 00:40:24.020
I'm used to it.

00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:28.730
Anyway, I don't care
what any of you think.

00:40:30.080 --> 00:40:30.900
This is who I am.

00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:33.130
I won't change.

00:40:33.310 --> 00:40:34.420
Why can't you change?

00:40:35.150 --> 00:40:36.210
You're so young.

00:40:37.110 --> 00:40:39.060
It's not too late to join the company
or go back to school.

00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:39.980
And you're so smart...

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:41.650
No matter how accomplished I become,

00:40:41.670 --> 00:40:42.980
I'd just be my dad's tool.

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:43.940
What's the point?

00:40:45.190 --> 00:40:46.340
All he cares about

00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:47.770
is his stupid wine.

00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:50.130
If I could study as well as you

00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:51.820
and rank
among the top three in the city,

00:40:52.110 --> 00:40:53.210
he'd definitely like me.

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:54.570
But unfortunately,

00:40:55.880 --> 00:40:57.380
I'm useless.

00:40:57.960 --> 00:40:58.980
So he doesn't like me.

00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:01.730
A useless tool is definitely unpopular.

00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:04.130
But you're different.

00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:06.290
At least you have a competent dad

00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:07.980
and my sister who loves you.

00:41:12.710 --> 00:41:13.290
Not like me.

00:41:13.310 --> 00:41:14.170
I've never experienced motherly love.

00:41:16.670 --> 00:41:17.130
Haotian,

00:41:17.310 --> 00:41:17.860
actually,

00:41:18.440 --> 00:41:19.690
Grandpa's always cared a lot about you.

00:41:20.110 --> 00:41:20.540
You...

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:22.940
He always says

00:41:24.840 --> 00:41:25.770
if it weren't for having me,

00:41:25.790 --> 00:41:26.730
my mom wouldn't have died.

00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:32.900
As if I asked to be born.

00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:38.500
I'll always remember

00:41:38.710 --> 00:41:40.900
my third birthday, when you all told me

00:41:41.110 --> 00:41:42.060
she wasn't my mom.

00:41:42.520 --> 00:41:43.290
And no matter how good she is to me,

00:41:43.310 --> 00:41:44.980
I can only call her sister.

00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:49.820
Maybe that's why

00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:50.820
she's so good to me.

00:41:55.150 --> 00:41:55.820
Actually,

00:41:57.190 --> 00:41:58.540
not having a mom isn't that special.

00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:01.060
You just have to swallow
your grievances.

00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:04.250
And cry under the covers at night
when you get home.

00:42:08.110 --> 00:42:09.090
Forget it. Let's not talk about this.

00:42:10.840 --> 00:42:11.570
Don't worry.

00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:13.570
Just

00:42:14.110 --> 00:42:15.090
go tell my dad

00:42:15.750 --> 00:42:16.730
I won't gamble anymore.

00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:19.290
There are plenty of fun things
in the world.

00:42:19.750 --> 00:42:20.460
This one isn't that great.

00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:26.460
Do you trust me that much?

00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:27.770
Yes.

00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:02.900
