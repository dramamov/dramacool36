00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:23.760
Come on.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.560
It's really fine, don't worry.

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:31.800
Do you have my contact info?

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.800
Open the door.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:00.400
Open the door.

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:11.280
Brother.

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:16.160
Let's go.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:12.720
Su Ruo.

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.000
Su Ruo.

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:50.600
Su Ruo.

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:02.840
Help!

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.440
Help!

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.520
Help!

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.320
Help!

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.520
After reading Brother Hui's notes,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.120
for several days in a row,

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.360
I kept having the same dream.

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:38.960
Su Ruo's death kept replaying

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:41.080
and haunting my mind.

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:43.360
I don't know what really happened.

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:44.360
What was the actual scene like?

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.040
Maybe I'll never know.

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:49.920
All I know is, in my dream, Su Ruo

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.040
was desperately calling out to me.

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:53.840
She screamed until her voice broke,

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:56.080
but I didn't notice at all.

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:00.240
Fragments keep flashing

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.400
through my mind.

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:04.000
Some are from my real past,

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:06.960
some happened when I traveled through time.

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:09.200
Maybe changing the past so often

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.960
is making my memories start to blur.

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:14.760
I've tried everything I could,

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:18.240
but I still can't stop Su Ruo's death.

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:20.520
What else can I do?

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:23.720
But...

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:25.440
I'm not ready to give up yet.

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:27.440
Before that,

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:29.640
there's one more thing I need to confirm.

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.680
I haven't been back in over ten years.

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:41.640
This place hasn't changed much.

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:47.760
You're wearing so many layers.

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:49.040
Aren't you hot?

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:51.600
Hot or cold is just how you feel.

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:53.040
It depends on the person.

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:57.280
You said the weather's been strange lately.

00:06:58.400 --> 00:06:59.840
Could it be related to cosmic events,

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:01.400
like comets or something?

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:03.960
Anyway, it's not about space-time tunnels.

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:07.640
What about the students?

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:10.920
Every few years, there's a new batch.

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:12.880
And the climate?

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:13.600
Every few hundred years,

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.240
there's a mini ice age.

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:18.600
Nothing in this world stays the same.

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:20.440
Change is the only constant.

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:22.720
Space-time rifts are the same.

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:25.080
They won't always be there.

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:28.440
Based on the timing in your novel,

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:29.480
in two days,

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:31.560
at nine o'clock the night after tomorrow,

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:34.440
it should recede.

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:37.080
So you're saying it'll disappear that night?

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:39.440
After that, every night at nine,

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:41.880
there won't be a time rift there anymore.

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:46.000
When will it show up again?

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.000
Maybe in a few hundred years,

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:49.080
or a few thousand years,

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:51.040
or maybe

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:52.520
it'll show up again next month.

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:56.440
It could appear in the northeast,

00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:58.320
or in Oceania,

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:01.880
or even on the moon.

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:04.280
The universe is so vast,

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:05.840
it can show up wherever it wants.

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:06.760
Anywhere it wants.

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:08.280
Whenever it wants to appear,

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:09.120
it just appears.

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:10.640
Right?

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:11.960
So basically,

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:14.880
the night after tomorrow is my last chance.

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:17.920
But...

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:20.040
How do you know this so precisely?

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:24.920
I just used your novel's

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:30.800
appearance times,

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:32.200
disappearance times,

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:33.960
and the intervals between them

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:35.240
to make a chart.

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:36.600
The pattern is obvious.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.000
It's easy to calculate.

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:39.240
But...

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:41.760
Are you sure you want to talk math with me?

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:01.320
I've decided to wrap up the novel.

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:05.680
There's something I need to remind you.

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:08.600
Every time your protagonist goes back,

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:09.680
it's random.

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:12.200
The only constant is

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:14.440
time flows forward there, just like here.

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:16.000
It always moves forward.

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:19.320
Based on your last chapter,

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:21.400
it was ten days before the Gaokao.

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:24.920
So if you go back this time,

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.880
and end up right at the Gaokao exam,

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:30.520
what will your protagonist face?

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:31.760
Do you know?

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:35.160
One hundred fifty points.

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:36.640
It's a Gaokao retake.

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:38.640
It's more than just a retake.

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:43.200
Magnetic field shifts disrupt protein phosphorylation cycles,

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:46.320
causing sleep disorders and metabolic syndrome.

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:49.120
Continuous energy output from another universe

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:51.400
is like your organs being starved of oxygen.

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:53.200
Besides that,

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:55.640
the college you attend will be different.

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:57.200
The people you meet,

00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:58.920
the jobs you do, all will change.

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:01.400
Everything will be turned upside down.

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:04.280
No one knows if it's good or bad.

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:08.120
Are you sure

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:11.520
you want to take this gamble?

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:15.400
And also,

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:17.600
space-time has a rejection mechanism.

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:19.240
If it detects

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:20.960
something that doesn't belong here,

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:23.520
it'll force you back to your original world.

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:25.960
If you try to fight this rule,

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:28.720
your body might suffer irreversible damage.

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:33.440
I don't know what will happen.

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:35.320
Maybe

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:38.200
you'll never come back.

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:41.200
Is it worth it?

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:45.400
I have another question.

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:49.760
If I truly have no other way,

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:51.640
and I tell her everything,

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:55.160
including that I'm from the future,

00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:58.160
what will happen in the end?

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:03.360
When someone knows the future,

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:05.680
what kind of butterfly effect will it cause?

00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:07.120
No one can predict that.

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:13.240
But personally,

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:16.760
I wish you luck.

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:22.720
Xie Haohui.

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:26.040
The thing I kept from you—

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:28.000
did you already guess

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.320
the final possibility?

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:37.280
I'm heading out.

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:43.000
Thank you.

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:51.760
Brother

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:54.160
Why are you here?

00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:56.640
Dad

00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:58.120
Auntie

00:11:58.880 --> 00:11:59.480
I'm here.

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:03.400
Xingchen, you've worked hard.

00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:03.960
Eat some more.

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:04.520
Okay.

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:08.200
Brother

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:12.160
What are you planning to do next?

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:15.200
I'm planning to find a girl.

00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:17.640
Congrats, Old Yu!

00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:19.120
Good things are coming.

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:21.680
Which girl?

00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:23.720
Do you have a photo to show me?

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:25.640
Dad

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:26.880
You've met her.

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:28.640
It's Su Ruo.

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:30.760
It's been years since we met.

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:31.800
Is she doing well?

00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:37.520
She's doing great.

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:40.480
That's good.

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:41.960
Your cooking skills

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:42.960
haven't declined at all.

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:44.560
It still tastes the same.

00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:45.440
It's delicious.

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:46.720
You should eat more.

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:47.600
Alright, alright.

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:48.400
Auntie, here.

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:49.360
You should eat more too.

00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:50.400
Alright, alright.

00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:51.840
You eat too.

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:55.640
Brother

00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:02.320
What exactly are you going to do?

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:05.160
Su Ruo

00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:08.360
Isn't Su Ruo already gone?

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:12.280
She's still alive.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:17.560
Brother

00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:22.040
You're always welcome home.

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:41.640
Su Ruo, in my eyes

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:44.200
Yu Xingchen

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:46.320
What do you want to do now?

00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:48.120
I want to settle

00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:49.720
everything once and for all.

00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:52.880
Should I say you're devoted

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.240
or just stubborn?

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:55.440
Darn it.

00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:56.760
You suddenly ask this—

00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:57.920
Who would remember?

00:13:58.560 --> 00:13:59.600
It's all in the past.

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:01.440
I've handled many similar cases.

00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:03.760
But Su Ruo's case—

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:06.560
Even without the classmate connection,

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:09.120
I still feel regret.

00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:14.360
Everyone could see

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:16.000
she actually liked you.

00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:18.280
We should always be together.

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:22.640
Yu Xingchen

00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:24.600
I like you.

00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:26.640
Why wouldn't I admit how I feel about her?

00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:27.840
Are you the only one who knows?

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:29.640
Her smile when she looks back—

00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:31.440
It really hits different.

00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:35.960
She often looked back at me like that.

00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:38.720
She never really accepted me.

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:43.080
Her heart was always only for you.

00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:46.200
If she worked somewhere else,

00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:48.040
or lived in a different place,

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:51.040
maybe things would end differently.

00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:53.280
If only she could be with you.

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:56.080
I mean it.

00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:57.880
Still talking about "if"?

00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:00.080
What if she trained for sports and went to a sports school?

00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:02.560
There's no "if" in real life.

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:04.080
If I could,

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:08.600
I'd try my best to pursue her.

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:11.880
I wouldn't get involved with Lou Yuting again.
