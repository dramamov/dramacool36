[Dr. Fu,]

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:41.759
[after discussion,]

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:42.080
[we think]

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.320
[your spoken English]

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.680
[doesn't meet our requirement,]

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:45.200
[so]

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.120
[we can't offer you this job.]

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.880
[Personally, I suggest]

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.240
[you improve your English speaking]

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.800
and communication skills.

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.280
[It'll make it easier for you to find a job.]

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:56.280
[Good night.]

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:05.600
Let me introduce

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:06.720
our new guy.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.680
His surname's Fu. He's educated.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:10.600
Never done manual labor before.

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.920
So cut him some slack, alright?

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.160
Mr. Zhu, so he's

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.520
laying floors with you this afternoon?

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:17.720
Please look out for me!

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:19.640
Never done renovation work before?

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:22.280
Just arrived here?

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.800
No,

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.400
I came here for school.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:28.480
Just graduated.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:30.920
Haven't found

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:31.840
the right job yet.

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:32.920
So I'm doing this

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.920
to make ends meet.

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:34.520
Just getting by for now.

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:36.400
Fresh grad?

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.720
So you got your master's here?

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.400
Master's and PhD.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.760
Perfect.

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.160
Come take a look at

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:45.079
these instructions.

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:46.800
Translation apps are useless for them.

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.680
Hey,

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:48.680
don't feel awkward.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:50.680
We're all just

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.040
trying to make a living.

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.960
Take it.

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:57.600
100, 150.

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.560
200, 250.

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.320
384.8 Canadian dollars.

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.280
Can I give you 380 dollars instead?

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.120
We're compatriots here, right?

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.600
[Dong,]

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.000
[I visited your dad today.]

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.720
[He asked]

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.159
[about your job.]

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:48.320
[I didn't tell the truth.]

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:49.240
[Remember,]

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:50.159
[don't slip.]

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:15.680
[I'm drinking with Mr. Fu.]

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:17.480
[My Mom cooked a whole feast.]

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.680
[Mr. Fu]

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:19.880
[asked about your graduation again.]

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.520
[I said you're buried in your thesis]

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:23.560
[and had no time for anything else.]

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:24.760
[Feels like he]

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:25.760
[still wants you to work back home.]

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:26.760
[I was trying to calm his worries.]

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.120
Shut up!

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:14.280
If you ask me,

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.280
not getting into that pharma company

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:17.520
isn't the end of the world.

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:18.360
Really.

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:19.280
Just stay here

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:20.400
and work with us.

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:21.360
Not bad at all, right?

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:22.080
Seriously.

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:23.680
If you actually left,

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:25.200
we'd be screwed.

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:25.880
Those

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:27.720
English manuals are a total headache

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:29.120
for us old folks.

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.720
A chemistry PhD doing renovation?

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:34.920
Not such a waste.

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:36.159
Look at Mr. Zhu.

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:37.680
He used to be a big shot

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:38.480
back home,

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:40.280
signing documents all day.

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:42.480
Now he's doing construction work like us.

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:44.120
Why drag

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:44.840
me in?

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:46.159
You used to be a head surgeon

00:06:46.159 --> 00:06:46.960
doing cancer surgeries.

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:47.440
Now you're

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:48.360
cutting wires every day.

00:06:49.159 --> 00:06:50.440
Hey, all honest work is good work.

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:53.320
Alright, enough.

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:54.960
We're all just trying to survive here.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:55.920
Alright, alright.

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:57.680
I heard you guys from outside.

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:59.480
Finish lunch and get back to work.

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:01.520
Let me introduce a lad

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:02.800
from my hometown.

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:04.400
This is Duan Zhihao.

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:06.120
Just call him Zhihao.

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:07.200
He's

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:08.360
greenhorn,

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:10.120
so teach him the ropes.

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:11.640
Alright,

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:12.920
eat up and let's get moving.

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:14.440
Nice to meet you all.

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:15.120
I'll

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:16.800
do my best to keep up.

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:18.120
No worries.

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:21.320
Zhihao,

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:22.760
quick word.

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:23.200
Okay.

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:36.880
Something feels off.

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:39.200
We need to

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:41.320
watch ourselves from now on.

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:46.880
He looks pretty kind to me.

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:49.280
Kind?

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:52.520
Did you hear

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:54.240
that sneaky boss?

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:56.520
They're from the same place.

00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:57.680
What does that mean?

00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:01.240
I bet he's either a spy or a supervisor

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:01.880
sent by the boss.

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:04.040
Either way, let's be careful

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:04.840
or we'll be in trouble.

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:06.040
That's total nonsense.

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:08.360
We're all compatriots, like family.

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:09.960
How can you think so badly of people?

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:15.400
As they say, better safe than hurry.

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:16.240
Not hurry, sorry.

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:17.120
Where are you going?

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:17.840
Upstairs to take a leak.

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:22.280
Remember to flush when you're done.

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:22.920
Sure.

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:24.760
Wait, doesn't it auto-flush?

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:36.280
One more guy,

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:37.640
shorter deadline,

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:39.520
but same workload.

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:40.600
And we're

00:08:40.679 --> 00:08:41.320
slower than before.

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:43.440
Guess we'll work overtime tonight.

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:44.520
Who's paying for that?

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:47.720
Lunch is decent today.

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:49.080
More meat than usual.

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:50.600
That sneaky boss...

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:55.840
Toss this.

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:03.520
Slow down, man.

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:04.760
No need to rush.

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:05.920
Here.

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:07.680
Thanks.

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:11.360
I eat fast normally.

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:13.440
My old job was always on a tight clock.

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:14.760
Old habit.

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:18.600
Can I ask

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:20.320
what did you do before?

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:22.520
Doctor,

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:24.280
back to work. Why poking around?

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:25.280
I'll be right there.

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:28.880
You're a doctor?

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:32.080
Yeah, PhD in chemistry.

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:36.440
I used to make films

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:37.960
in Taiwan, China.

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:39.160
I was a film director.

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:41.920
Mostly art films, and you

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:44.320
probably never heard of them.

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:46.880
I didn't make it big

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:48.640
and burned through all my money.

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:50.360
So I ended up here.

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:56.640
Why did you come

00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:57.520
to Canada?

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:00.000
My kids

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:03.880
are here.

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:06.880
They came over early on.

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:08.320
I was alone back home.

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:10.960
I just couldn't let it go.

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:13.200
But now,

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:14.800
I just have to

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:16.600
accept it,

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:17.200
right?

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:48.080
Damn.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:26.560
What happened?

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:49.600
Don't move.

00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:13.040
Zhang Ran.

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:15.640
I don't know if you have any plans

00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:16.520
this weekend,

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:18.040
but I think maybe we can go grab a drink?

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:22.560
Probably.

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:23.840
Can I get your number?

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:24.880
I'll give you a call

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:26.480
and see if you're free.

00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:28.760
Yes, yes.

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:30.000
Give it to me.

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:36.240
From the moment I met you,

00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:39.120
I felt an incredible connection.

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:40.440
Please marry me.

00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:42.400
It's too fast.

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:45.920
I'm not ready for marriage.

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:47.400
You bring so much joy

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:48.240
into my life.

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:51.040
I can't imagine

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:52.280
a future without you.

00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:54.120
We can have a wonderful

00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:55.000
life in Canada.

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:47.680
Ms. Zhang, your entry card.

00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:51.200
Please call me Mrs. Zimmer.

00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:54.000
Oh, I'm so sorry, Mrs. Zimmer,

00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:55.960
but your name on the ticket is...

00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:58.000
Just married. Last month.

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:01.800
Wow. What a gorgeous ring. Congratulations.

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:03.800
Can I give you our breakfast menu?

00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:05.560
Yes, please.

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:33.720
Sorry, I'm late.

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:35.480
So many reports in the office.

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:37.160
Is this for me?

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:38.120
Yes, for you.

00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:42.360
I'm gonna go shower.

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:42.880
Okay.

00:14:57.720 --> 00:14:58.680
Mr. Wu, to what do I

00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:00.080
owe the pleasure of this call?

00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:01.920
Pierce isn't home.

00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:04.360
What money?

00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:10.880
C-Can you tell me what's going on?

00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:29.280
This is none of your business.

00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:31.680
What do you mean

00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:32.560
none of my business?

00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:33.360
If you don't pay rent,

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:34.160
you'll get kicked out.

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:35.080
You lied to me.

00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:36.360
You told me

00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:37.720
this is your place.

00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:39.040
Oh, that's why you married me?

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:39.520
Huh?

00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:42.120
You just want my money and my house.

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:43.000
Screw you.

00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:44.840
I signed a fucking clean-up,

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:45.440
remember?

00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:48.880
You didn't get shit,

00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:50.040
but you spent every penny

00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:50.720
I have.

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:53.520
You led me money? No, no, no.

00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:55.280
You begged me to do the investment for you.

00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:56.960
Not even charge you commission.

00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:04.120
You bastard.

00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:06.560
I'm sorry.

00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:10.920
Hey, I lost my mind.

00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:12.520
But it's just because I love you.

00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:15.080
I love you so much.

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:16.000
You love me?

00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:18.360
Don't worry about the money

00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:19.200
- or the rent.
- You love me?

00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:20.240
Don't touch me.

00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:24.040
Baby, don't worry about the money or the rent.

00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:26.280
If you

00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:27.720
just give me three months,

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:29.160
my new business will be back,

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:30.720
and everything will be fine.

00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:33.240
I can even buy you your own show.

00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:36.680
You can't be trusted.

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:38.120
We're done.

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:41.720
I'm divorcing you.

00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:44.480
And I'm getting my money back.

00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:47.040
I want my two years back.

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:48.120
What about mine?

00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:50.720
Loser! Loser!

00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:01.560
The best

00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:03.080
decision I've ever made in my life

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:04.080
is signing

00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:06.160
a prenuptial agreement before we got married.

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:16.280
Again? Come on.

00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:18.320
Talk to me here.

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:23.320
Anyway,

00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:24.840
it's over.

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:28.040
I'm free, finally.

00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:33.560
Go chase your pathetic dream.

00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:36.160
Take it and get the hell out,

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:37.200
my wife.

00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:30.280
[Dong?]

00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:32.080
[Dong?]

00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:35.160
Just talk. Say anything.

00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:37.520
Nothing, just checking in

00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:38.400
and making sure you stay awake.

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:40.720
How long's your drive back?

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:43.360
About an hour.

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:46.320
[Won't your fried noodles get cold?]

00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:48.400
I've got a microwave.

00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:50.920
These noodles are cheap anyway,

00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:51.840
and they're good.

00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:53.720
I'm getting home late, and I'm tired.

00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:56.760
You always tight

00:20:56.760 --> 00:20:57.520
on time?

00:20:58.400 --> 00:20:59.640
Driving while half-asleep?

00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:02.680
It's mainly because today's client

00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:04.000
was so far from my place.

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:05.360
Farther than the last one.

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:07.000
But honestly,

00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:08.120
[last time I almost]

00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:08.760
[dozed off while driving.]

00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:09.600
[Pretty dangerous.]

00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:11.320
That's risky.

00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:14.160
Be careful.

00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:15.720
Crap,

00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:16.880
talking to you while driving,

00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:17.760
I think I took a wrong turn.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:20.520
[No big deal.]

00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:23.160
[If you made mistakes, just start over.]

00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:26.840
[My bad.]

00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:28.240
I'm on the right road.

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:29.320
I misread the navigation.

00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:31.320
So it's not your brain that's the problem,

00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:32.920
it's your eyes.

00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:34.320
That's treatable.

00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:36.680
[He said you visited him?]

00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:37.960
Who?

00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:39.080
Who else would it be?

00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:40.920
[You mean your dad?]

00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:43.720
[Yeah, that day]

00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:45.240
[Cheng Man's friend]

00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:46.680
[gave her two bottles of Maotai.]

00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:47.800
We're trying

00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:49.120
to stay healthy lately,

00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:52.560
so I'm off alcohol.

00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:54.760
And I gave them to Mr. Fu.

00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:57.400
What's up?

00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:00.080
It's fine.

00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:04.280
You know what?

00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:05.800
I really don't get it.

00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:06.760
Why do you have to

00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:08.080
butt heads with your dad?

00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:09.160
Mr. Fu is really nice.

00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:10.640
I love talking to him.

00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:12.440
We never run out of things

00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:13.960
to chat about.

00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:15.480
You could talk to anyone.

00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:17.000
You'd chat with a trash can

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:18.080
for half an hour.

00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:20.720
Have you ever seen me talk to

00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:21.240
a trash can?

00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:22.280
I don't remember that.

00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:23.520
Oh right,

00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:25.400
your dad gave me a mission.

00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:27.760
To talk some sense into you.

00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:32.200
Mission accomplished.

00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:34.360
Stop it.

00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:35.280
I don't

00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:37.000
have time to think about this.

00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:37.760
Go do your thing.

00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:39.080
Gotta go. Bye.

00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:31.640
Stop the freaking party!

00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:33.720
[It's already past midnight.]

00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:34.320
[Don't you know that?]

00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:35.680
Shut up. Let me finish.

00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:37.520
We got families with small children

00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:37.960
living here.

00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:39.720
You're not allowed to

00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:40.560
make noise all night.

00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:42.000
[This is a public area,]

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:43.000
[you nosy lady.]

00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:45.520
[We have every right]

00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:46.520
[to party here.]

00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:50.760
[Stop having a barbecue here.]

00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:51.880
[It's a major fire hazard.]

00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:54.240
You're such a meddling busybody.

00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:54.800
Everyone around here

00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:57.560
is sick and tired of the noise

00:24:57.560 --> 00:24:59.160
[you've been making for months.]

00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:02.560
[This isn't a suggestion for you guys.]

00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:03.720
Shut

00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:05.200
the party down right now.

00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:08.960
This is against the rule.

00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:10.040
It's hurtful,

00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:11.440
[and I'm done with it.]

00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:13.080
[Don't be a psycho.]

00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:14.600
[Don't be a psycho, you cunt.]

00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:16.200
[Go watch some TV.]

00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:18.280
This shit is legal, lady,

00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:20.080
and foreign entertainment.

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:21.720
You!

00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:22.760
Don't be an idiot.

00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:23.680
You're

00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:24.280
a disgrace, sucker!

00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:25.480
[Learn the law.]

00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:27.960
[Don't give me this fucking attitude.]

00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:28.880
[Fucking bastard.]

00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:29.800
Did you hear that?

00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:31.280
Listen,

00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:33.080
I'm not gonna put up with it.

00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:35.440
Stop fooling around, you prick.

00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:37.400
Take a hike!

00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:38.120
Don't try it.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:40.880
Let's check with the police

00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:41.760
and ask

00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:43.040
how legal that is.

00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:45.120
Hey, let it go.

00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:47.040
[Don't come back.]

00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:49.360
If you come back again,

00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:51.560
I'll be crazy enough to kick your ass.

00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:53.000
I promise I will.

00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:58.920
Go to hell, you freaking trash.

00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:01.120
Get out of here!

00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:03.000
Get out of here!

00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:03.880
That's great.

00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:04.720
Good for you.

00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:06.080
Get out of here!

00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:15.600
[Why's it so noisy over there?]

00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:17.360
[Are you fighting with someone?]

00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:26.840
You're cool. Give me five.

00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:30.960
No,

00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:33.400
we've got a badass here.

00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:34.720
Remember what I told you before?

00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:35.720
Some people downstairs

00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:36.640
throw parties all the time.

00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:38.360
Super loud every day.

00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:39.400
Total disturbance.

00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:40.960
It drives everyone crazy.

00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:42.160
Complaints never worked.

00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:43.840
Just now a woman

00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:44.720
stormed down

00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:46.200
and chewed

00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:47.080
them out.

00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:47.800
They finally left.

00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:52.520
Thank you.

00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:55.200
What?

00:26:58.520 --> 00:26:58.840
Shit!

00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:40.640
She's crying. What do I do?

00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:44.640
The woman who yelled at them.

00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:52.760
[What's that]

00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:53.720
[got to do with you?]

00:27:58.600 --> 00:27:59.440
From her crying,

00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:01.960
I think she's Chinese too.

00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:09.720
[Wow, PhD indeed.]

00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:11.160
[You can tell that from how she cries?]

00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:14.840
Imperial jade liquor?

00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:17.120
180 yuan a glass.

00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:19.120
You're Chinese too?

00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:21.920
What's wrong?

00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:24.240
Why sitting here?

00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:29.400
My drain's clogged,

00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:32.960
and I locked my keys inside.

00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:55.640
Want me to help?

00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:01.040
I'm broke!

00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:06.320
I have no money!

00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:13.120
What should I do?

00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:18.000
This is so hard.

00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:25.720
The pipes are all old.

00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:26.880
I'll swap in

00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:27.640
a new U-pipe.

00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:29.920
How much?

00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:31.640
No charge.

00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:34.320
This is nothing.

00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:35.400
Just one-minute job.

00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:40.640
It's all

00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:42.200
moldy under here.

00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:44.000
I'll clean it up later

00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:45.360
and spray some remover.

00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:46.200
I'll be good as new.

00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:49.920
I told you I don't have money.

00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:51.760
Relax.

00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:53.440
I'm not charging you.

00:30:56.120 --> 00:30:57.760
Chinese help Chinese, right?

00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:00.840
Who hasn't

00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:03.160
hit hard times overseas?

00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:04.520
And honestly,

00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:06.040
I'm working as

00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:07.200
a handyman now,

00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:09.960
but I'm actually a PhD.

00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:12.680
Well, I used to be a TV anchor.

00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:15.960
You don't believe me?

00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:32.960
It really is you?

00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:34.280
But I think

00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:35.160
heavy makeup doesn't

00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:35.560
suit you.

00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:38.600
I don't mean you're not attractive.

00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:40.800
I just don't get

00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:42.440
why many girls

00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:43.120
wear such heavy

00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:44.080
makeup.

00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:46.000
They look completely

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:46.520
different

00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:47.280
with it on.

00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:51.480
You're really a PhD?

00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:53.360
Chemistry PhD,

00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:54.880
specializing in unclogging drains,

00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:56.240
part-time problem solver.

00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:00.320
You don't

00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:02.520
dissolve bodies, do you?

00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:04.440
Depends

00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:05.520
who it is.

00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:11.320
Scared?

00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:12.440
Not really.

00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:16.560
What about you?

00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:18.440
You came here for

00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:19.920
hosting work?

00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:21.880
I came here for marriage.

00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:24.120
Got divorced.

00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:26.960
Shocked?

00:32:29.240 --> 00:32:29.760
Not really.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:34.840
Thought I found a soulmate.

00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:37.240
Turned out to be a liar.

00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:39.040
And today's my birthday.

00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:45.440
Alright, all fixed.

00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:46.440
That fast?

00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:49.280
Y-You really don't want money?

00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:50.880
Told you it's free.

00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:52.240
Hey,

00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:54.040
there's a gray

00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:54.720
pickup truck downstairs.

00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:55.440
It's mine.

00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:56.800
I'll wait for you in the truck.

00:32:57.320 --> 00:32:57.840
Why?

00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:00.640
I'm not going.

00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:02.800
Rest assured.

00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:04.440
Chinese help Chinese.

00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:06.520
It's your birthday, right?

00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:08.200
Hurry up, we're running out of time.

00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:19.840
Wait.

00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:38.520
Let's go.

00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:51.120
Then I'll head...

00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:53.920
Happy birthday.

00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:00.240
Then I'll head...

00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:01.920
Happy birthday.

00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:25.560
Life always seems to have other plans.

00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:30.640
I thought I could be an interpreter.

00:41:32.440 --> 00:41:33.080
But now

00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:37.560
I'm a loser.

00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:18.040

00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:48.400
Make a wish.

00:42:54.360 --> 00:42:55.320
I'll carry on.

00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:01.920
Done.

00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:15.880
It's just for the ceremony.

00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:17.080
You really gonna eat it?

00:43:18.200 --> 00:43:19.040
Isn't this rice?

00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:19.800
Can't I eat this?

00:43:20.280 --> 00:43:20.880
I haven't had

00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:21.920
a proper meal in a month.

00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:31.760
Looks like you don't have much stuff here.

00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:33.760
I've got a lamp

00:43:34.120 --> 00:43:35.080
I'm not using anymore.

00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:36.120
I'll bring it over for you.

00:43:39.240 --> 00:43:40.320
You have everything over there?

00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:43.880
What?

00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:46.640
Do you have everything in your room?

00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:49.040
Yeah, yeah.

00:43:49.640 --> 00:43:50.720
I've been living here two years.

00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:54.800
Are you single?

00:43:58.880 --> 00:43:59.760
Let's be together.
